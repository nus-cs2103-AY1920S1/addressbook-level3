= Philip Alexander Boediman - Project Portfolio for MyProject

== Introduction to the project

My team of 4 NUS SoC students and I were tasked to enhance a command line addressbook application. We decided to convert it into a all-in-one project management app called *_MyProject_*.

*MyProject* has various features to aid team leaders in project management. Some of the more prominent features include:

* Keep track of members' performance
* Generate meeting timings
* Keep track of project's finances
* Record meeting minutes
* Keep track of ongoing and upcoming tasks
* Send out reminders for upcoming meetings and tasks
* Broadcast email for important announcements (My Contributions)

These are what our MyProject pages look like:

My role was to design email related features. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
that I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contribution towards the team project.

=== Major Enhancement - Email feature

==== Enhancements Implemented:

- `signIn` command
* lets user signs in using his/her Google account.
- `logOut` command
* lets user signs out from his/her Google account.
- `sendMail` command
* sends a personal email to one member in the project / contact list.
- `broadcastMail` command
* sends a personalised broadcast message to all members in the current project.
- `sendReminder`
* sends a reminder to all members in the project of the upcoming meeting and tasks
which are due in specific number of days defined by user.


==== Justification

Team leaders often have information that they want to convey to the team members about updates or changes made to
the project or remind team members of the upcoming meeting or tasks. There might be several applications in which
the project groups are formed in the social media platforms. Team leaders may have to switch between different applications
to locate the project group in this platform and this process is oftentimes time-consuming. With this enhancements,
team leaders will be able to relay his message to his members in a single application, *_MyProject_*, where all the informations
on his various projects are stored.

==== Highlights

These enhancements are extremely useful and use very intuitive command formats which are very similar to the
normal GUI that user normally encounters and are very easy to remember. Some of the challenges faced were in understanding how the javax.Mail
works which was outside the coverages of the course. These enhancements are extendable as we can further enhance to support
more email domains which users wish to use as well as send attachments. Overall, the enhancements can support all the basic one-way mailing features which
are sufficient for the optimisation of the team leaders' works.

==== Credits
Credits to https://javaee.github.io/javamail/ for providing the JavaMail library and the javax.Mail API.

=== Secondary Enhancement - Meeting attribute in the project.

==== Enhancements Implemented:

- `AddProjectMeeting` command
* lets user adds a meeting to .
- `DeleteProjectMeeting` command
* lets user signs out from his/her Google account.

==== Justification

Every projects will definitely have meetings, thus team leaders can easily keep track of upcoming meetings
in the projects that he/she has.

==== Highlights

This enhancements is extremely useful as meeting is a very crucial part in a project's progress. Meetings
added by the user will automatically be sorted based on the meeting time (earliest to latest).

=== Other contributions
** Project Management
*** Tested team members' features and reported bugs for amendment.
*** Implemented Time class which are widely used in the project.
** Documentation
*** Proof-reading the project's User Guide and Developer Guide

== Contributions to the User Guide

We had to provide a user guide for users to familiarise themselves with our application.
The user guide consists of easy navigation to certain parts of the user guide, features implemented
in our application and a summary of commands available in our application.
