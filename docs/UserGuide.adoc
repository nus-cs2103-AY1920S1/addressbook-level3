== Introduction

Thank you for checking out TimeBook!
// tag::ppp-introduction[]
TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3).
TimeBook is a scheduling application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of you and your friends.
It also can find the common free time and venues among you and your friends.
TimeBook will have the following features:

. A graphical user interface (GUI) but most of the interactions with the application would happen using command line interface (CLI).
. Allows users to add the schedules of his or her friends and organise them into groups.
. Deconflict different schedules of different people and different groups to find the common free time among them.
. Integration with NUSmods API to allow users to enter their NUSmods timetable link to add it to their schedule.
. Integration with Google Maps API to allow the application to evaluate the best venue for the group to meet up during the free time in their schedules.
// end::ppp-introduction[]

== Understanding this guide

=== Basic Information

This guide explains how you can use *TimeBook* to the fullest extent to assist you to plan for your group's meeting.

You can find the steps needed to start scheduling group activities with your friends or loved ones in the <<Quick Start, *quick start section*>> and general *lifecycle* usage of our application.
If you happen to stumble upon some difficulties, our <<FAQ,*Frequently Asked Questions*>> (FAQ) is here to address that.
If you are an experienced *Command Line Interface (CLI)* user, you can hop right into using the application by looking at our <<Command Summary, *Command Summary*>>.
Otherwise, take a look at the <<Inexperienced CLI user, *Inexperienced CLI User*>> section to obtain more information on how to use our application.

We have used the following symbols to help you better understand our application usage.

== Inexperienced CLI user

Unlike most applications, where you use your mouse to interact with the application such as scrolling and clicking, our application mostly use the *Command Line Interface*.
Most of the time, you would be interacting with the application through typing commands in the command box of the application.

You can play around with the commands in <<Command Summary, *Command Summary*>> to get yourself warmed up.

== GUI Components

In this section, you will learn more about the different components of our application.
Here is an overview of all of the components in our application:

image::guiComponents.png[]

=== MenuBar

You may use the menu bar to access file or exit the application.

image::menuBar.png[]

=== Schedule Display

The schedule display is the main component that you will be looking at to look schedules of yours or others!

image::scheduleDisplay.png[]

==== How to read the schedule view

Unsure of how to read the combined schedules of your friends in TimeBook? Here is a simple example to guide you!

TimeBook ensures that the leftmost column will always start from today's date. Each unnumbered coloured block belongs to
someone's schedule in the group. For example, the image below highlights all of Charlie's schedule.

image::charlieBusyTimeslot.png[]

Take note of the numbered green boxes you see below!
[[FreeTimeSlot-Scheule]]
image::freeTimeslot.png[]

These are the common free time slot that you and your *entire* group members share! You can use
these numbered green boxes to arrange your meetings or share it with your group members to pick.

****

image:./icons/important.png[] Note that the labels for each of the coloured block will become hidden if each block becomes too small!
To get more information about the coloured block, you can just hover your mouse over it! +

****

=== Tabs

Tabs will contain your contacts and your groups.
You can use it to see all your existing contacts and groups!

image::tabs.png[]

=== Result Display Box

This box shows you whether your command executed is successful or unsuccessful.
If you encounter an error message here, look at our <<FAQ,*Frequently Asked Questions*>> section to see what is the cause of error.

image::resultDisplayBox.png[]

=== Command Box

Type your commands here to execute them!

image::commandBox.png[]

// tag::suggestions-autocomplete[]
=== Suggestions Autocomplete

TimeBook comes with a helpful feature that provides suggested commands or relevant values so you can spend less time typing commands and more time on your group meetings.

When you type a command, TimeBook will show a dropdown with similarly matching commands.
For example, you type in the command `add`.
TimeBook will then suggest commands such as `addevent`, `addgroup`, `addperson` like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step1.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

If you meant to type the `addevent` command, you can immediately select it by pressing the kbd:[Tab] key.
Otherwise, you can pick other options by using the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow keys and then hit the kbd:[Tab] key to confirm your selection.
For now, try selecting the `addtogroup` command using the kbd:[Down] and kbd:[Tab] keys.
TimeBook will complete the command like this:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step2.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

*****
image:./icons/lightbulb.png[] You can type an abbreviated version of any command as long as the letters are in order!
For example, instead of typing `addtogroup`, try `atg`.
*****

Remember how TimeBook can also suggest relevant values?
Let's try that by specifying a person's name using the `n/` parameter like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step3.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

Again, TimeBook provides useful suggestions, in this case, the names of the people we've previously added.
Now, try using the kbd:[Tab] key to immediately fill in "Bobby".

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step4.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

Now, let's complete the `addtogroup` command.
Let's add Bobby to the Friends group by typing `g/` and using the suggestions to help us pick the Friends group.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step5.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step6.png[]
|=======

Let's say we change our mind and don't want to add Bobby to the Friends group.
No problem, just remove Bobby's name and pick someone else using the familiar kbd:[Up], kbd:[Down] and kbd:[Tab] keys.
TimeBook is smart enough to only fill in the name parameter and won't mess up the rest of your command.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step7.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step8.png[]
|=======

Congratulations!
You've now mastered the suggestions feature using just three simple keys, the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow keys to navigate between suggestions and the kbd:[Tab] key to select it.
// end::suggestions-autocomplete[]

The following sections will explain all the commands we have in TimeBook and what they do.

When a person is removed from the group, the group's schedule will automatically be updated as well!

==== Deleting a group: `deletegroup`
____
The project is over, and there is no need for this group anymore? Delete it!
____

To delete a group, simply execute the `deletegroup` command and
specify the group's name!

Format:

* `deletegroup g/GROUP_NAME`

****
* The `g/` prefix specifies the name of the `group`
* image:./icons/important.png[] deleting a group does not delete your contacts!
Your contacts still exists in your persons tab!
****

Let's delete CS3203 group from our TimeBook! Simply use this command!

Example:

* `deletegroup g/CS3203`

image::scheduler/deletegroup.png[width=100%]

Deleteing a group will automatically update your groups tab!

// tag::showgroup1[]

==== Show group: `show`

Want to see your group's schedules to plan for your next group meeting? The `show` command is what you need to see
the schedules of your group members! You can view a group's schedule up to 4 weeks in advance. +

==== Look at some members: `lookat`
Suppose that all of your group members are extremely busy and the common free time is too short to do any productive work,
you may use the `lookat` command to see if you can meet with some of your group members. You *must* be viewing a group's
schedule in order for this command to work.

Format:

* `lookat [n/Name]...`

The `lookat` command takes in any number of `n/Name` arguments and highlights the group members according to name.

Example:

Let's use the same schedule exactly like the one shown <<#showgroupresult, above>>.

* Type `lookat n/Bobby n/Denise` if you are interested to inspect both Bobby's and Denise's schedules!
You should see that both of these schedules become highlighted.

//tag::select-command[]

==== Select Time Slot: `select`
____
Want to get more information about a particular time slot? Want to know where the venue of that time slot is?
No worries! Simply select the time slot and TimeBook will tell you all about it!
____

When viewing a schedule on TimeBook, you can select a time slot to get more information out of it!

The `select` command works when you are viewing a group's schedule, person's schedule or home page! The format for this command's
use are detailed below!

Format (group schedule): `select n/NAME [week/WEEK_NUMBER] i/ID`

* Selects a time slot specified by `ID` that belongs to a person specified by `NAME`, on week `WEEK_NUMBER`

Format (person schedule): `select [week/WEEK_NUMBER] i/ID`

* Selects a time slot specified by `ID` on week `WEEK_NUMBER` that belongs to the current person shown in the schedule

* If a name is specified, TimeBook will ignore it! Because we know you want to view the current person that is shown!

Format (home): `select i/ID`

* Selects a time slot specified by `ID` on your home page. The home page will not show the ID of the time slot,
the `ID` is ordered with the earliest time slot as `ID:1`

* If a person name or week is specified, TimeBook will ignore it! Because we know you want to view the time slots on your home page!

Prefixes:

* `n/`: specifies the name of a person
** A name must be alphanumeric
* `week/` specifies the week of the schedule (optional)
** A week must be an interger between 1 and 4 inclusive
** If no week number is specified, TimeBook will choose the default week 1
* `i/`: specifies the ID number of the time slot
** An ID must be a positive number.

When you execute the `select` command, it  generates a pop up window that shows you the details of the selected time slot!
We have also integrated this service with GoogleMaps and shows you the location of this time slot on the map!

The figure below shows how a pop up window will look like!

image::scheduler/selectpopup.png[width=100%]

After you have viewed the time slot details, simply press the `ESC` key on your keyboard, and it will close the pop up!
You will never have to touch your mouse!

| image:./icons/important.png[] | When the location of the time slot is not a valid location in NUS, the location
will not be shown on the map!

The following shows some example usage!

image::scheduler/select1.png[width=100%]

When a group's schedule is shown, each members time slots are colour coded as shown above.
Each time slot is also labeled with an ID for easy reference!

Let us try to select Bobby's time slot 1. To select it, simply execute the following command!

Example:

* `select n/Bobby i/1`

After executing that command, a pop up will be shown just like the one above!


image::scheduler/select2.png[width=100%]

When a person's schedule is shown, each events are colour coded as shown above.
Each time slot is also labeled with an ID for easy reference! The name of the event is also shown!

Let us try to select time slot 1. To select it, simply execute the following command!

Example:

* `select i/1`

After executing that command, a pop up will be shown just like the one above!

image::scheduler/select3.png[width=100%]

When the home page is shown, you can select each time slot on the list! Do note that the first time slot on the list
will have `ID:1` and the following time slots will follow with the next number. We chose to omit the number so you have
a more cleaner home page!

Simply execute the `select` command and specify the time slot you want to view like so:

Example:

* `select i/1`

After executing that command, a pop up will be shown similar to the one above!

//end::select-command[]

//tag::Closest-Common-Location[]
[[Closest-Common-Location]]
=== Closest Common Location

TimeBook will also help you to decide where to meet for your project meetings by suggesting to you an optimal
location for everyone. The optimal location is the closest location for everyone to meet in NUS based
on their schedule. In time book we define the optimal location for everyone as the _closest common location_.

*Steps*

. Set up your group by:
.. Adding your group members to your TimeBook with `addperson` command
.. Adding your group to TimeBook with `addgroup` command
.. Add your group members to your group with `addtogroup` command
. Get the relevant information for your group schedule with `show g/[GROUP_NAME]`
.. Identify the `ID` and `Week` of the time slot you want to get the closest common location for.
. With the free time slot `id` and `week` get the details for the closest common location with `selectfreetime` command
. Press `esc` button to close the popup

*Constraints*

Due to the lack of internet connectivity, TimeBook will only support locations that are in NUSMods and identifiable by Google Maps.
The full list of supported locations is <<UserGuide#Supported-Locations, below>>.

*Definitions*

. We define closest common location as the location that requires the least average distance to travel to and from different sources by car.
. Locations that are not supported are voided and are not used for the calculations of the closest common location and average travelling distance.
. Refer to the `Developer Guide` on how we computed the closest common location.

==== Select Free Time `selectfreetime`

Select a free time slot to launch a popup window with all the relevant information to help you make decide on the venue
to conduct your project meetings at. The image below is an example of the popup.

Below is an example of a popup.
[#img-SuccessfulPopup]
.An example of a popup when `selectfreetime` is executed
image::gmaps/SuccessfulPopup.png[SuccessfulPopup]

command: `selectfreetime [week/WEEK_NUMBER] i/FREETIMESLOTID`

Examples:

* `selectfreetime i/3`
* `selectfreetime week/2 i/3`

_Description_

When the command is executed, a popup will appear that shows all the information of the closest common location
for a particular free time slot in a group.

_Prerequisite_

. You must be have group on TimeBook with members in it.
. You must execute `show g/[GROUP NAME]` before executing `selectfreetime` command.

_Parameters_

. `[WEEK_NUMBER]`
- Description: The week(1-4) of the group schedule you want to select the free time slot from. If parameter is not
stated, it will default to the first week(the default schedule when you execute `show g/GROUP_NAME`).
- Type: `Integer`
- Enum: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`
. `FREETIMESLOTID`
- Description: ID of the free time slot in the <<UserGuide#Supported-Locations, schedule>>. You can get this from the number in the free time slot box.
You can only enter the `id` that is shown on the screen.
- Type: `Integer`

_Success Response_

If you follow the steps above, a popup will appear as seen in the Figure above.

There are two main information that you will see in the popup when you execute the command.

. The summary of the results that will be `displayed` on the top of the popup.
.. *Your best location to meet up is:* The first choice location to meet(closest for everyone).
.. *Everyone's locations:* List of locations that the group members will be at before the free time slot.
.. *Out of all these locations, the valid locations are:* List of TimeBook supported locations that the group members
will be at before the free time slot that.
... Subset of the *Everyone's locations:* list
.. *Locations that cannot be found in NUS:* List of locations that the group members will be at before the free time
slot but not supported by TimeBook.
... Subset of the *Everyone's locations:* list
... If all the locations are valid, this attribute will be empty as seen in the Figure above
. The full details of the first, second and third closest common location will be shown at the bottom of the popup.
.. First choice represents the first closest and so on and so forth.
.. The average distance(m) to reach the various locations will be displayed below the respective choices.
.. The picture of the location of the venue on Google Maps will be displayed below each choice.
... For locations that are not supported on Google Maps, a picture of the center of NUS will be displayed.


_Failure Response_

Feedback box will show:
```
 We could not find a common location because all places cannot be found in NUS. The locations are:
```

- `Error` when all the group members are not in school before the free time slot, a popup will not appear.

Feedback box will show:
```
We could not find a common location because:
Everyone has not started their schedule yet. Feel free to meet up any time.
```

- `Error` when invalid free time slot `ID` entered.

Feedback box will show:
```
Invalid time slot ID: 0. Please enter a valid id as shown in the GUI.
```

== FAQ
[qanda]
[[alice-notice]]
How do I store my details and schedule?::
// tag::user-profile-full[]
// tag::user-profile-brief[]
When you first start using TimeBook, a default profile will be created for you!
This default profile will have a default name: `User`
// end::user-profile-brief[]
 +
{nbsp} +
To personalize TimeBook and make it yours, rename `User` by entering the command `edituser n/Your Name Here`. If you'd like to fill in more details, you can do so using the <<edit-user-command,`edituser` command>>.
// end::user-profile-full[]
+
{nbsp} +
How do I transfer my data to another Computer?::
 Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TimeBook folder.
+
{nbsp} +
Why can I enter irrelevant arguments?::
We understand that users occasionally make error while typing and it is frustrating for the application to fail because
of it. Thus for all commands that do not require any arguments(ie `help`, `home` and `exit`), TimeBook allows you to
enter any value after the command word. For example `help 1` will execute `help` command eventhough `1` is irrelevant to
the command. We hope with this feature you will have a seamless and pleasant experience with TimeBook.
+
{nbsp} +
Help! I encountered an error!::
We understand that you may encounter a weird error message and are unsure of what it means so we prepared this section that describes the uncommon errors that you may see.

| Clash in events | There is already a pre-existing event that is happening at that time slot.
| Duplicate Mapping | This person is already in the group.
| Cannot find closest location | The closest common location cannot be determined because everyone is not in NUS.
| XXX does not exist | This person or group does not exist in TimeBook. Some names are case-sensitive.
| No schedule to XXX | This error occurs when you use `scroll` and `togglenext` command when there is no schedule shown.
| No group schedule is shown | You'll see this error when you are invoking the `look at` command when a group schedule is not displayed.
