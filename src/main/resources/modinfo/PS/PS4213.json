    "description": "The issue of morality in international politics is frequently treated as marginal to the contemporary concerns of states in their international relations. Developments such as the Nuremberg Trials, the Cold War, the African Famines of the 1980s, the Genocides in ex-Yugoslavia and the emergence of wrangles over resource exploitation and environmental pollution call attention otherwise. This module equips the student with the conceptual tools and frameworks with which to comprehend and make informed decisions about these cross-boundary ethical complexities. Both Political Science majors and non-Political Science students will find this a useful supplement to studies of international politics and philosophy.",
