    "description": "While Asian waters are at the heart of our geopolitical world, from unending resource wars to widening biological hotspots, they have figured little more than linkages between lands in today\u2019s area studies and regional histories. This course aims to help students better understand not only the historical web of human-ocean interactions in Southeast Asia but also the challenges that confront today\u2019s regional society in the age of climate change. The hope of the course is for us to think through what it might mean and what it might look like to anchor what scholars have called the 'blue humanities' in Southeast Asian waters.",
