    "description": "Pharmacovigilance is one of the key regulatory functions, and monitors the safe effective use of pharmaceuticals in the real-world healthcare setting. The scope has progressively increased to include risk management planning for product life cycle management which encompasses appropriate drug use, signal detection and other risk mitigation/minimisation activities. This 4-credit module provides the background to the evolved role of pharmacovigilance in optimising safe and effective use of pharmaceuticals. This covers regional and global models, approaches to risk communication among stakeholders, and the detection, assessment and management of safety signals. In addition, the scope will include a segment on handling substandards and falsified pharmaceuticals.",
