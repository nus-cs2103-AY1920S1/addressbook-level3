== Introduction

=== What is Powerlifting Competition Coordinator?

Powerlifting Competition Coordinator is a free application for powerlifting competition event organizers
that is simple, fast, and easy to use. It is targeted at organizers of small to medium sized powerlifting
competitions who require a hassle-free way of managing and tracking the lifts of participants in and out
of the powerlifting competitions. During competition mode, the system has real time maintenance of athlete
rankings within their respective weight classes allowing the organizer track the participants'
standings at all times throughout the duration of the competition.

=== Core team

Powerlifting Competition Coordinator  was developed and is maintained by
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-3[Team T11-3].
Feel free to https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-3/main/issues[contact us] for any enquries.

=== Contributing

Powerlifting Competition Coordinator is an open source project and we would love to involve any contributor
who has a passion for powerlifting.
To get involved, start by reading <<SettingUp#, Section 2, “Setting up”>>.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.


== Design

This section documents the design and interaction of components in Powerlifting Competition Coordinator.
Please take a moment to understand the different components before making any code changes.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a
quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component (needs to change)

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.


== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Context-Switching feature between sessions

===== Overview

Our features are mainly split into 2 contexts. An in-competition, and an out-of-competition session mode.
A session is started when the user wants to start an existing competition to call lifters to perform their attempt,
record them, and finally to view the ranking leader board for the competition, all within in-session mode.
On the other hand, an out-session mode, when the user exits the competition session mode,
is where all create, read, update delete of the Person, Competition, and Participation is done.

The reason for this context-switching feature is to prevent users from using out-session commands that are strictly for
in-session mode and vice versa.

.Activity Diagram for average user flow from out to in-session.
image::ActivityDiagram.png[]

Figure 9 shows the average user flow of how the user can go in-session,
and also distinctly shows the commands that can be done in each state.
However, the end of every competition session does not signify the end of a user's activity.
The user can still go in and out of the competition session (start and end), to perform the different commands
from the different states.

===== How it is being implemented (mingsheng)

=== In-Session
In-Session is the state where the user enters competition mode, where users can command the app to generate
the next lifter, as well as record any attempt. At the end of the competition, the rank of the participants
and competition can be viewed too.

To handle the state of the competition, we have created a new `Session` class that is packaged into model and
managed by the ModelManager. The `Session` class is a singleton class, and only has one instance in the ModelManager.
The reason behind the use of a singleton class to handle sessions, is that we only want one ongoing session at any
point in time.

.Class Diagram of the Session package in the Model
image::SessionClassDiagram.png[]

==== Next feature


==== Lift feature

==== Rank feature

==== RankList feature

==== End session feature
This feature ends the session, and shifts the user back to the out-session state.
All data stored in the session will be reset to default.

Format: `endSession`

When we first implemented the session feature, the session can only be ended when a competition has ended,
which means there are no more attempts to be made. However, we have now made it such that the user can switch
between sessions as and when, even in the middle of the competition. This gives users more flexibility to switch between
session states, without worrying about the state of the competition.


=== Out-Session

==== Start Session feature
The start session feature is a command to start a new competition session, when a user is not in competition state.

Format: `startSession`

==== Competition features

==== Participation features
A Participation is an association class we have created for every Person who has participation in a particular
Competition. A person can take part in many competitions, and for each competition he/she takes part in, there will be a
corresponding Participation class associated to that Person and Competition instance.

===== Create a new Participation
To create a new Participation, the associated Person and Competition must exist. If either doesnt,
an exception will be thrown to the user through the result box to prompt the user to input an existing one.

Format: `addParticipation n/Athlete Name c/Competition Name s/S1/S2/S3 b/B1/B2/B3 d/D1/D2/D3`

Note: S1 means the 1st attempted weight for the Squat and so on.

===== List Participation
The list participation feature allows the user to filter the participation list on the PCC app based on a particular
competition. If no parameters (competition name) are taken in,
the command will list out all of the participations stored in the system.

Format: `listParticipation` or `listParticipation c/COMPETITION_NAME`

===== Delete Existing Participation
The user can delete an existing participation, maybe in the case he/she has withdrawn or is disqualified
from that competition.

Format: `deleteParticipation INDEX`

We have decided to use the index of the participation in the list to delete a participation instead of
other parameter types, like the name or competition of the participation. The main reason is because,
there may exist more than one participation with the same name and different competition,
or different name and same competition.

Pros:

* Takes in less parameters, user can type less.

* Avoid complications between unmatched name and competition.

* Easy to implement.

Cons:

* User will have to scroll through the participation list on the app to type in the index.
