== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*

Implemented a series of commands and features to manage user's password. This includes adding a `Password` model
and its subclasses of `Description`, `Username`, `PasswordValue`, `Website`, `ModifiedAt`, `ExpiryMode`. In addition,
I implemented the supportive commands to the password model such as `AddPasswordCommand`, `FindPasswordCommand`, `CopyCommand`, `DeletePasswordCommand`,
`ReadPasswordCommand` and `EditPasswordCommand`  commands.

*What it does*

* Allows the user manage passwords and keep track of when they should change their passwords.

*Justification*

* Many small and medium enterprises now have a plethora of accounts to use for day-to-day activities.
It is hard to keep track of all the passwords without compromising on security. This feature aims to alleviate the password management
on businesses and improve data security.

*Highlights*

*  A new `Password` model was created to support the management of passwords.
Numerous commands were also implemented for this enhancement.
This enhancement requires in depth analysis of the current structure of the architecture as it relies on all the existing components.
In addition, Software Engineering Principles, such as SOLID, YAGNI and DRY Principles, were used.
Defensive programming is also evident throughout the enhancement.
