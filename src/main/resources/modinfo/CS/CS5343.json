    "description": "From the covert digital water in Titanic to the mixed real and virtual actors in Avatar, from the arm-controllable Wii games to the completely full-body-play Xbox Kinect games, computer animation technologies have advanced significantly during the past decades, both in the movie and the game industries. This module reveals all the exciting behind-the-scene techniques that make these movies and games possible, including but not limited to motion capture, fluid animation, facial animation, and fullbody character animation. This is a project-based course that aims to provide strong foundation on advanced computer animation methods and prepare students for research in animation.",
