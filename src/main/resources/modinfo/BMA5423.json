The challenge of managing successfully, self, and others, in an increasingly complex and global environment is the focus of this module. The module leads students to develop a deeper understanding of how management practices and\nprocesses can often differ across national and regional boundaries, and why. Leveraging on this understanding,  managers will be led to consider and formulate strategies and tactics for negotiating these differences to develop\nglobal management capabilities.",
