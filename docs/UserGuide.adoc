== Introduction

+Work is a project management tool that allows students to successfully achieve your objectives for their project.
It is aimed at NUS project leaders who are in charge of a small project group of less than 20 people.
+Work is a one-stop application to help you manage your members, meeting times, task allocations as well as equipment purchased.
Take full advantage of our Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the all the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Happy working!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `pluswork.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your +Work.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some commands you can try to get you started!:

* **`add-member mn/Adam Smith mi/AS`** : Adds a member with name "Adam Smith" to the project.
* **`add-task tn/Finish up milestone setting`** : Adds a task with name "Finish up milestone" to the project.
* **`assign ti/1 mi/JD`** : Assigns the project member "John Doe" (with member id "JD"), to the task "Finish up milestone setting".
* **`doing-task ti/1`** : Changes status of task "Finish up milestone setting"  to `doing`:

[NOTE]
====
- Adding a member tag is optional in the adding of a new member.
- It is possible to add a member with multiple tags following this format: +
`add-member mn/New Member mi/NM mt/UG mt/DG mt/...`

Therefore, this command is invalid: `edit-inv ii/4`
However, this command is valid: `edit-inv ii/4 i/toys ti/4 mi/AR`

Example:

* `edit-inv ii/4 i/toys ti/4 mi/AR` +

==== Adding a task: `add-task`
As mentioned in the earlier part of user guide, to add a task to the project, use the `add-task` command in the format below. This will result in a series of questions that allow you to add deadline and a member to the task. The following flowchart shows this series of feedbacks from the application and user inputs.

image::ml-task_1.PNG[]

Format (to add task): `add-task [t/TASK_NAME]` +
Format (for yes): `yes` +
Format (for no): `no` +
Format (to add deadline and member): `add-d [at/DEADLINE] [mi/MEMBER_ID]`

The following flowchart shows this series of feedbacks from the application and user inputs.

image::ml-task_3.PNG[]

Format (for done task): `done-task [ti/TASK_ID]` +
Format (for yes): `yes` +
Format (for no): `no` +
Format (to add price and member): `add-i [p/PRICE] [mi/MEMBER_ID]`

[NOTE]
`add-i` command does not work unless it is typed after `done-task` and `yes`. +
Unlike `add-task`, in this case both attributes price and member id are required.

Example:

* `done-task ti/8` +
The task with index 8 will have its task status changed to done. Since the task is tagged as “Inventory”, this will prompt a series of questions, as shown in the pictures below.

** First, type `done-task ti/8`

image::ml-task_4_1.PNG[]

** This prompts the feedback asking for your choice to add it as an inventory.

image::ml-task_4_2.PNG[]

** After typing `yes` as the user input, feedback will prompt you to add the details.

image::ml-task_4_3.PNG[]

** Type `add-i p/5.50 mi/AB` to set the price at $5.50 and to assign the member with member id “AB” to the inventory

image::ml-task_4_4.PNG[]

** This sets the price and assigns the member successfully! You should see a window like this.

=== Settings Commands

+Work helps you view your current settings by highlighting your current option! To see your current settings navigate
to the settings panel by entering `settings` as described in section Section 3.1.3.

==== Switching the theme of +Work: `theme`

This command helps you toggle the theme of +Work between `light` and `dark` to suit your viewing preferences.

[TIP]
By default, the theme is set to `dark`.

Format: `theme light`

Example:

* Type `theme light` into the command box as shown below.

image::theme-light-preview.png[]

* Hit the kbd:[Enter] key and +Work switches to the `light` theme! As seen below, your choice of `light` is highlighted as well.

image::theme-light-res.png[]

* Similarly, `theme dark` switches to the `dark` theme.

==== Switching the time format of +Work: `clock`

This command helps you toggle the time format of +Work between 24 hour and 12 hour clock. +

[TIP]
The time format is set to 24 hour by default.

[NOTE]
This does not affect the input format of deadlines for tasks, you still need to be enter them in the 24 hour format!

Format: `clock twenty_four`

Example:

* Type `clock twelve` into the command box as shown below.

image::clock-twelve-preview.png[]

* Hit the kbd:[Enter] key and +Work switches the time format to the 12 hour clock! As seen below, the new format is highlighted as well.

image::clock-twelve-res-settings.png[]

* Now when you navigate to any view which has time sensitive data, you will see that the format has been switched. For example, if you were to switch
back to the dashboard by entering `home` you should see a window similar the one shown below.

image::clock-twelve-res-dashboard.png[]

* Similarly, `clock twenty_four` switches to the 24 hour clock.

// end::settings[]

=== Saving Data

Project data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Command Line Autocomplete

+Work will automatically prompt you on the various possible commands based on input and help you paste the correct command format into the command line if chosen. +
For example, when you type `add-mem` into the command-line, +Work will prompt you to select `add-member` from the drop down and paste `add-member mn/ mi/ mt/` into your command-line automatically.

== FAQ

*Q*: Can I use file formats other than ics for the calendar feature? +
*A*: No, the file format has to be in ics folder, downloaded either from NUSmods or Google Calendar.

*Q*: Can I export the claims report as a word document? +
*A*: No, the application only supports exporting of files in PDF format.

*Q*: What if the calendar cannot find a timing where everyone is free? +
*A*: There will be a grid showing the number of available members by time, so it will be easier for the user to choose the best possible time for the meeting.

*Q*: My project has a budget, does the application help me keep track of the projects financial status? +
*A*: Using /inventory the application can keep track of current expenses for each task and the member who purchased it, however, there are currently no accounting services available.

*Q*: Some of the tasks for my project require sub tasks to be completed, is there a way to add them? +
*A*: Ideally since the user is the project leader, they should only see the main tasks to be accomplished for the project. This would help facilitate their managerial role within the project. Hence, the application does not support subtasks.

*Q*: How can I add multiple users to the same task? +
*A*: Since +Work is member-oriented, the application displays information according to members. Hence, you have to assign task to all the different members that are working on the task.

*Q*: What happens when a task has been completed? +
*A*: You can mark the task as `done`, which will move the task to the bottom of the task list. In the case where you do not want to keep the task in the list, using ‘Remove Task’ will delete it.
