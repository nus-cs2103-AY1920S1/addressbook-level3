Hi! My name is Wei Gen.

I am currently a second year student in NUS School of Computing, pursuing a Bachelor of Computing (Honours).

This project portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of FinSec, a project
that my team and I completed for the module CS2103T. This project has definitely been greatly beneficial to my own
learning and self-development in becoming a more competent software engineer.

== PROJECT: FinSec

== Overview

FinSec is an application that was created with the end goal of aiding Financial Secretaries of any organisation in
managing their financial data, mainly their contacts, claims, incomes and budget. It is a Command Line Interface (CLI)
based tool to cater to computing professionals who are highly adept at typing but also provides a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) interface for any users _(like you!)_ to easily view interact with FinSec.

== Role

My main role was to act as the Team Lead for the project, completing team tasks for the project and managing
general tasks for the team members. As I was the only one who has been in the position of our target audience and
could best understand their user requirements, so I was also the one to set the directions of the project.

I also developed the Claims feature _(including logic, storage and model)_, as well as adding the
association between Claims and Contacts. I also created the documentation and tests that came along with the features.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Claim feature*
** *What it does*: To allow users to add Claim entries into the FinSec application and track their claim entries.
** *Justification*: The `Claim feature` is a vital feature to the FinSec application since that the majority of
organisations and clubs have claims to keep track of.
** *Implementation*: The Person class in Address Book 3 (AB3) is remodelled to resemble a claim entry _(with additional
attributes of ID, Description, Amount, Date and Status)_.
** *Highlights*: The implementation of this feature is fairly manageable since that it is an adaptation of the Person
class. However, there is much more coupling compared to the Person class, thus it is more complex. There are also more
stringent testing required, such as `Date` parsing.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the *Approve and Reject Claim features*
** *What it does*: To allow users to approve or reject pending claims.
** *Justification*: Claims can have different statuses, and `Budget` will behave differently depending on their
statuses.
** *Implementation*: ApproveClaimCommand and RejectClaimCommand will check whether the claim chosen is a PendingClaim,
and only if it is can its status be approved or rejected respectively.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the *association between Claims and Contacts*
** *What it does*: To ensure that adding a claim into the app's list of claims will also add the claim into the
associated contact's list of claims as well.
** *Justification*: Each claim added is associated to a contact. The user will be able to view all the claims associated
to a contact when viewing them using the CheckCommand.
** *Implementation*: During the addition of a claim, the app checks if there is a contact with the
entered name. Only if there is an existing contact for the claim will the command be executed. It also adds
the Claim ID to the contact's list of claims.
** *Highlights*: I have also added a table to the IndividualContactWindow for the user to view the details of every
claim of each contact easily when they use `check` command on the contact.
