    "description": "This module examines the development of a wide range of private and institutional collecting practices in Europe and Asia, from the late medieval period to the present day. It draws on diverse theoretical approaches to collection studies. The course seeks to understand the contributions of collectors to art-production, display and taste-making and value-arbitration, and, consequently to the overall contours of art history and its canons. It adopts an inter-disciplinary approach to demonstrate how collectors have actively shaped other histories of modernities, nationalisms and cosmopolitanisms.",
