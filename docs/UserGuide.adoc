== Introduction

*LiBerry* is a desktop app for librarians to *quickly manage their community libraries!*
LiBerry is optimized for librarians who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
You can type quickly and serve your long line of borrowers in a short amount of time.

LiBerry can manage all your books and borrowers efficiently and meticulously. You can easily add new books to your library
records, register new borrowers, loan out books, track outstanding fines and more!

This user guide will introduce to you the different features of LiBerry and how to use them!

[[Features]]
// tag::UGshiyao3[]
== Features
This section contains a detailed guide to every feature LiBerry supports, including how to use and the
format of the commands to use the feature.
The following table shows the format used to describe each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `find t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `find t/Harry Potter`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. E.g. `t/TITLE [g/GENRE]` can be used as `t/Harry Potter g/fiction` or as `t/Harry Potter`.
* Curly brackets indicate that at least 1 of the optional parameters have to be given, e.g. `{ [t/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR] }` can be used as `t/Harry Potter`
* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, e.g. `[g/GENRE]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `g/fiction`, `g/fiction g/adventure` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

// end::UGshiyao3[]

=== Using Normal Mode

Normal Mode is for librarians to manage the books in the library. Commands in normal mode are not specific to any borrowers. Normal Mode also provides some utility commands to help the librarian use LiBerry. However, it is important to note that commands specific to Serve Mode cannot be used while in Normal Mode.

// tag::UGHelp[]

==== Viewing help : `help`

Opens up a help window, which shows a summary of the list
possible commands that you can execute. +

.Screenshot of Help Window
image::HelpWindow.png[]

The figure above shows a screenshot of the help window.
The left side of the window shows the command while the
right side of the window gives a description of the command
and a usage example.

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `harry` will match `Harry`
* When searching by book titles and authors, partial words will also be matched e.g. `Har` will match `Harry`, `J` will match `J K Rowling` and `Jin Yong`
* Books matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `harry` will return both `Harry Potter` and `Harry Botter`

* `[t/TITLE]` will be used to search through book titles
* `[a/AUTHOR]` will be used to search through or filter by authors
* `[g/GENRE]` will be used to search through or filter by genre
* `[sn/BOOK_SN]` will be used to search through book serial numbers
* Only 1 of the following 3 flags can be used
** `[-overdue]` will only show overdue books
** `[-loaned]` will only show loaned books
** `[-available]` will only show available books
* Adding one of the following will sort the books such that:

** `[-popular]` will list the top 10 most borrowed books ** - Coming in v2.0**
** `[-new]` will list the 10 newest books ** - Coming in v2.0**
****
