A wide variety of real-world case studies (including examples of transportation, utility, electronic, mechanical, enterprise, traditional information and document management systems, etc.) will be drawn upon. The course addresses issues such as dealing with legacy and change, enterprise-wide interoperability as well as support for knowledge management.",
