*Content*

== Introduction
//tag::intro

Welcome to _TravEzy_! 😊

Firstly, thank you for downloading our application. We greatly appreciate your support and
we *promise* to make travel easy with _TravEzy_.


What is _TravEzy_?

_TravEzy_ is a desktop application with a command line interface (CLI) and is *perfect* for NUS students who love travelling as much as we do. With a CLI, you will be able to type in your commands much faster than similar applications which require you to keep using your mouse. Furthermore, since this is a desktop application, you do not need a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) to start using _TravEzy_.

TravEzy is perfect for:

* Managing your busy calendar and finding the best time to take that much needed holiday!

* Crafting the ideal itinerary for your trip :)

* Tracking your expenses during your trip, so that you have enough money left for the trip home

* Journaling and looking at fond old memories in your diary

* Keeping in contact with your old and new friends with the help of _TravEzy's_ address book



So, is _TravEzy_ for you?

* Are you a busy university student with a passion for travelling?
* Are your summers and winters swamped with internships, projects and CCA activities?
* Do your numerous commitments get in the way of your travel plans?

IF you answered yes to the questions above, then *yes* it is. If not, it still is :)

travel to +++<u>+++Section 2, “Quick Start”+++</u>+++ to start TravEzy 😊

=== Structure of this Document

There are *alot* of things that TravEzy can do.

We've split up this guide into the different features of our application, namely:

* Main

* Address Book
* Diary
* Achievements

In each of the above sections, you will be introduced to the *Interface* of the feature and the *Commands* that will
help you make travel easy.

NOTE: *Interface* refers to how _TravEzy_ will be presented to you and how you can interact with _TravEzy_.
In this guide, we have included images of *exactly* what you should see in _TravEzy_ at every step, so don't worry! 😊

NOTE: *Commands* refers to what you wil be typing into _TravEzy_ to start making travel easy. Again, there are plenty of
images to ensure clarity. 😊


=== Reading this Document

Symbols and exquisite (okay, different) fonts are exciting, aren't they? Let's find out more about what they mean in this document!

.Symbols and fonts
[grid="rows", frame="none"]
|===
| Symbol/font | What does it mean?

| _italics_
| Italicised text indicates that the text has a definition that is specific to the application. Do look out for the definitions of these words along the way. If not, please look at the glossary in section 13).

| ``command``
| A grey highlight means that you can type the words into _TravEzy_ and it will start performing tasks to make travel easier for you

| ``MONTH``
| Uppercase letters that are highlighted in grey indicate that the word is a _parameter_.footnote:[A parameter is like a field in your regular form. Just replace it and fill it up with anything appropriate. 😊]

| ``m/MONTH``
| The slash and letter (or word) before the _parameter_ is a _prefix_. It is used to separate the current _parameter_ from other _parameters_.

| ``[m/MONTH]``
| Square brackets imply that the the stated _prefix_ and _parameter_ are optional. (This means less typing! 😆)

| 💡
| A light bulb indicates that the enclosed text is a tip.

| ⚠️
| A warning sign indicates that enclosed text is important.

Well, _TravEzy_ has got you covered. Simply inform _TravEzy_ of your schedule (your _commitments_, _school breaks_, public _holidays_ and _trips_) and _TravEzy_ will suggest periods of time when you can travel! Excited to find out more? Well... Read on!

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's calendar_ looks like:

image::calendarScreenshots/calendarInterfaceUG.png[Calendar interface,width=800]

{nbsp}

To help you easily differentiate between various types of _events_, _TravEzy_ has categorised the _events_ into four types: _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ and _trip_. Visually, _TravEzy_ also uses different _labels_ for the different types of _events_, as shown in the image above.

WARNING: The _labels_ indicate the *type* of _event_ you have for that particular day. It does not indicate the number of _events_.

=== Adding an event to your calendar: ``add``

Whew! After reading so much, it is time to find out how you can add your _event_ so that _TravEzy_ can start suggesting when you can travel! 😊

=== Checking your availability for a trip: ``check``

Do you need to find out whether you are available to go for a trip? You can get _TravEzy_ to find that out for you (i.e. when you happen to have a _school break_/_holiday_ *and* do not have any _commitment_/_trip_).

Let's find out how!

*Format:* +
``check d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To check whether you are available on 9 December 2019,

image::calendarScreenshots/check2.png[Check result,width=600]


=== Suggesting a suitable time for a trip: ``suggest``

The end of the semester is near. It is time to look for some cheap flights🛫! However, before deciding which flight to book, you need to find out when you can travel. Need some help with that? No worries! _TravEzy_ has got you covered. 😊

How so? Just ask _TravEzy_ to suggest a suitable time!

*Format:* +
``suggest d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR] [p/PERIOD]``

*Examples:*
****
* To find out when you can travel between 9 and 20 December 2019,

    suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019

image::calendarScreenshots/suggest2.png[Suggest result,width=600]

== Itinerary

Now that you have booked your flight, it's time to start planning your trip using _TravEzy's_ Itinerary.

In _TravEzy_, we have broken down your events into 6 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date_, _Time_, _Location_,
_Description_ and _Tag_.

For example, here is an Itinerary entry about our trip to Japan

. _Title_ -> Visit Tokyo DisneySea
. _Date_ -> 12122019
. _Time_ -> 1000
. _Location_ -> DisneySea
. _Description_ -> Remember to take pictures with the Disney Mascots!
. _Tag_ -> Priority: Critical

In the Itinerary, you will be able to add, delete, edit, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special
tasks that you can do with your Itinerary. Read on to find out more! 😊

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary looks like:

image::ItineraryInterface.png[width=800]

=== Adding an event: ``add``

Planning to visit DisneySea tomorrow? Add some rides that you plan to take then! 🎢

*Format:* +
``add title/TITLE date/DATE time/TIME [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION]``

*Example:*

    add title/Ride DisneySea Electric Railway date/12122019 time/1500 l/DisneySea

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``add title/Ride DisneySea Electric Railway date/12122019 time/1500 l/DisneySea`` in the _command box_.

Step 2. Remember to prioritize your events using the _Priority dropdown box_, to one of the 5 different priorities:

. Priority: None
. Priority: Low
. Priority: Medium
. Priority: High
. Priority: Critical

After selecting the priority for the event, press _Enter_.

Done!
Your event has been successfully added! HAND, TravEzy! :D"

*Format:* +
``edit INDEX [title/TITLE] [date/DATE] [time/TIME] [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION] [tag/]``

[TIP]
If you wish to edit the tag field in the event, indicate it with the prefix ``tag/`` and use the _Priority Dropdown Box_
to select the new priority.

*Example:*

    edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/`` in the _command box_.

Step 2. If you indicate a change of the priority in the edit command using ``tag/``, do remember to select the new priority using
the _Priority Dropdown Box_.

Step 3. The _result box_ will display the message "Updated successfully! :D
HAND, TrazEzy~"

Step 4. _TravEzy's_ Itinerary will showcase the new _event list_ with the edited event.

image::ItineraryEdit2.png[width=600]

information.

*Format:* +
`add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG] [r/REMARK][c/COUNTRY]`

[WARNING]
Address Book does not allow duplicate contacts. A person should not have the same `NAME`, `PHONE` and `EMAIL`

[TIP]
Tags are useful ways to categorize your contacts. For example, tag a person with: +
 +
`add n/Alice p/918273645 e/alice@example.com t/friend`,
the `t/` prefix is used for tagging. +
 +
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

*Examples:*
****
* To add a person into the address book,

    add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01

* To add a person into the address book specifying a tag and country,

    add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal r/Best friend c/Singapore

****

Welcome to _TravEzy_! 😊

Firstly, thank you for downloading our application. We greatly appreciate your support and
we *promise* to make travel easy with _TravEzy_.


What is _TravEzy_?

_TravEzy_ is a desktop application with a command line interface (CLI) and is *perfect* for NUS students who love travelling as much as we do. With a CLI, you will be able to type in your commands much faster than similar applications which require you to keep using your mouse. Furthermore, since this is a desktop application, you do not need a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) to start using _TravEzy_.

TravEzy is perfect for:

* Managing your busy calendar and finding the best time to take that much needed holiday!

* Crafting the ideal itinerary for your trip :)

* Tracking your expenses during your trip, so that you have enough money left for the trip home

* Journaling and looking at fond old memories in your diary

* Keeping in contact with your old and new friends with the help of _TravEzy's_ address book



So, is _TravEzy_ for you?

* Are you a busy university student with a passion for travelling?
* Are your summers and winters swamped with internships, projects and CCA activities?
* Do your numerous commitments get in the way of your travel plans?

IF you answered yes to the questions above, then *yes* it is. If not, it still is :)

travel to +++<u>+++Section 2, “Quick Start”+++</u>+++ to start TravEzy 😊

Symbols and exquisite (okay, different) fonts are exciting, aren't they? Let's find out more about what they mean in this document!

.Symbols and fonts
[grid="rows", frame="none"]
|===
| Symbol/font | What does it mean?

| _italics_
| Italicised text indicates that the text has a definition that is specific to the application. Do look out for the definitions of these words along the way. If not, please look at the glossary in section 13).

| ``command``
| A grey highlight means that you can type the words into _TravEzy_ and it will start performing tasks to make travel easier for you

| ``MONTH``
| Uppercase letters that are highlighted in grey indicate that the word is a _parameter_.footnote:[A parameter is like a field in your regular form. Just replace it and fill it up with anything appropriate. 😊]

| ``m/MONTH``
| The slash and letter (or word) before the _parameter_ is a _prefix_. It is used to separate the current _parameter_ from other _parameters_.

| ``[m/MONTH]``
| Square brackets imply that the the stated _prefix_ and _parameter_ are optional. (This means less typing! 😆)

| ⚠️
| A warning sign indicates that enclosed text is important.

== Itinerary

Now that you have booked your flight, it's time to start planning your trip using _TravEzy's_ Itinerary.

In _TravEzy_, we have broken down your events into 6 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date_, _Time_, _Location_,
_Description_ and _Tag_.

For example, here is an Itinerary entry about our trip to Japan

. _Title_ -> Visit Tokyo DisneySea
. _Date_ -> 12122019
. _Time_ -> 1000
. _Location_ -> DisneySea
. _Description_ -> Remember to take pictures with the Disney Mascots!
. _Tag_ -> Priority: Critical

In the Itinerary, you will be able to add, delete, edit, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special
tasks that you can do with your Itinerary. Read on to find out more! 😊

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary looks like:

image::ItineraryInterface.png[width=800]

=== Adding an event: ``add``

Planning to visit DisneySea tomorrow? Add some rides that you plan to take then! 🎢

*Format:* +
``add title/TITLE date/DATE time/TIME [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION]``

. Priority: High
. Priority: Critical

After selecting the priority for the event, press _Enter_.

[TIP]
If you wish to edit the tag field in the event, indicate it with the prefix ``tag/`` and use the _Priority Dropdown Box_
to select the new priority.

== Diary

The sweetest part of any holiday is looking back at your fond memories. TravEzy's
_Diary_ allows you to do just that! Here is our _Diary_ right below!


image::DiaryInterface.png[width=800]




In TravEzy, we have broken down your memories into 4 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date and Time_, _Place_ and _Memory_.

For example, here is a _Diary Entry_ about our trip to Tioman

. _Title_ -> First time Snorkeling
. _Date and Time_  -> 30/12/2019 0900
. _Place_ -> Tioman Island
. _Memory_ -> Saw so many beautiful fish!




In the _Diary_, you will be able to add and delete your _Diary Entries_. There are also a few more *special* tasks that you can do with your _Diary_.
Enjoy!


=== Adding diary entries to your diary ``add``

Trying to journal about your fishing trip? The _Diary_ allows you to add _Diary Entries_ and keep them alive in your desktop forever.

*Format:*

`add t/TITLE d/DATE TIME [p/PLACE] [m/MEMORY]`


TIP: Keep your input for _Title_, _Place_ and _Memory_ short! No more than 50 characters for _title_ and 100 for _place_ and _memory_! This will help you
keep your _Diary Entries_ short and sweet!



*Example:*


    add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 2300 p/Pulau Tekong m/Caught the biggest fish ever!

TIP: Note that _Date_ is input in this format:
dd/mm/yyyy HHMM:
| d = day | m = month | y = year | H = Hour (24HR) | M = Minute |


*Format:* +
`add t/TITLE d/DATE TIME [p/PLACE] [m/MEMORY]`


*Example:* Lets take the example of our midnight fishing trip!

 add t/Fishing Trip d/12/12/2019 2300 p/Pulau Tekong m/Caught the biggest fish ever!



WARNING: We know you're a young student, so we've kept the range for the year in _Date_ limited to 1980 - 2030


*Step by step:*

Lets take the example of a midnight fishing trip!

You never know who may use your laptop when you're away. The _Diary_ can help you to protect your memories to stop hackers from looking at your private memories with a _username_ and _password_.
If you ``setDetails``, you will not be able to use the ``unprivate`` command and will have to use the ``unlock`` command (See below).

*Format:*

``setDetails user/USERNAME password/PASSWORD``

*Example:*


    setDetails user/youcanthackme password/youreallycanthackme


WARNING: You can only set your details once! After that, you will have to delete TravEzy if you forget your password and need to unlock entries. This is done to ensure *NO ONE* misues your personal information


TIP: Keep your username and password long to keep those pesky hackers out! Minimally, make sure your username and password are alphanumeric and 8 characters long
