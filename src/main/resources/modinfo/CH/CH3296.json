    "description": "This module focuses on the early development of Chinese civilizations from prehistoric times to the Song dynasty (960\u20101279). Its primary purpose is to show that certain cultural features that we would today identify as Chinese actually emerged from a complex historical situation where different historical trends interacted, negotiated and competed with one another. Various dimensions, including the art of governing, modes of thinking, social and cultural practices and etc. will be explored in light of historical, literary and philosophical writings. The course, taught in English, is open to all students who are interested in traditional Chinese civilisation.",
