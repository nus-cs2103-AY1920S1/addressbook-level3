Focusing on the development of urban and metropolitan areas and the dynamic forces that drive urban growth as well as shape urban spatial configurations, this module examines the impact of government regulations and public policies on real estate markets. Selected topics include planning and development controls, degeneration and urban renewal, private-public participation, leasehold policy, public versus private housing, and urban fiscal policy such as property taxation, local government finance and development and betterment levies. It also provides an overview of the incentives created by the legal and institutional framework on real estate development.",
