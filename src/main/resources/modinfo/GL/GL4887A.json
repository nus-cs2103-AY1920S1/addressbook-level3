    "description": "This course examines the impacts of globalizations on the modern Middle East from 1798 to the present. During this period of local, regional, and global transformations, the Middle East witnessed the collapse of the Ottoman and Qajar Empires, World War One, World War Two, colonialism, decolonization and the Third World Movement, the nation-state building projects of the newly created Arab countries, the Cold War, the global oil politics, and most recently the Arab Spring. The course may focus on connections between the Middle East and other regions including Asia in the context of those global events.",
