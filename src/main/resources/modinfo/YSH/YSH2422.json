    "description": "Homosexuality has recently become a flashpoint in local and global cultural conflicts, from debates over 377a in Singapore and 377 in India to debates across the globe over gay marriage; homosexuality, modernity, and national identity; and the related issue of trans* rights. This course provides an introduction to the historical context for those debates by exploring the legacy of the colonial regulation of (homo)sexuality and the rise and global circulation of both gay and antigay politics. It also surveys some of the patterns in how those debates have developed locally in recent decades.",
