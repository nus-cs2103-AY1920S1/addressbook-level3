    "description": "This course deals with the study of human behavior in organisations: how people influence organisational events and how events within the organisation influence people's behaviour. Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation. The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on. In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?",
