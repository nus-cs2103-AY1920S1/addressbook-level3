== About the Project
For our Software Engineering Team Project, my team looked to enhance a basic Command Line Interface app. We decided to transform it into a Calendar and Scheduling application called Horo. Horo helps the user maintain a to-do list and to schedule their activities and is able to post reminders to their desktop.
My role was to design and implement the Notification system of the application. Subsequent sections will go into greater detail with regards to my contributions, as well as the documentation I have added to User and Developer guides.

=== Enhancement Added: Notification System

[cols="2,8"]
|=======
|What it does  | The Notification System runs in parallel to the main thread in the app. Every minute, it checks whether the user should be reminded of any Event or Task, and posts a new notification if necessary.
|Justification | The Notification System is a natural extension of an application meant for tracking deadlines and schedules. It serves to remind a forgetful or busy user of their commitments.
|Highlights    | •	An initial design for the notification system involved running it not as a parallel thread, but as a separate background application. This would allow notifications to be posted even if the main app were closed. However, this design was eventually reworked.  Going forward with the original design would necessitate the development of a second application that the user would have to install in addition to Horo. This would have been at odds with module requirements and learning objectives.

                 •	An alternative design involved running instantiating the Notification System as a separate component to UI, Logic and Model. However, this design would have been at odds with OOP principles. The Notification System was thus further split into separate extensions of the Logic and UI packages.

== Contributions to the User Guide
The following section includes excerpts of my contribution to the Horo User Guide, explaining the Notification System and the notif_on and notif_off commands.

=== Notification System
Horo will post notifications to your system tray to remind you that an event is starting or that a task is due.

Take note that Horo can only post reminders as long as the application is open. To tell if Horo is running, check that the appropriate icon appears in the system tray

.Horo tray icon

{empty} +
Also take note that notifications are switched on by default upon launch. This status is not carried over between sessions. If you would like to switch notifications off, you would have to do so whenever you start Horo up.

You can tell if notifications are switched on by mousing over the icon in the system tray.

==== Notification Popups
When Horo posts a notification, it should appear at the bottom-right side of the screen, where the system tray should be.

==== Switch notifications on

1. If you would like to switch notifications on, type the command *`notif_on`* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

2. An in-app popup should appear, displaying “Notifications switched on”. The log view should also record this action. +

The following section includes excerpts of my contributions to the Horo Developer Guide, explaining the class architecture and behaviour behind the Notification System.

=== Notification System
==== Class Architecture
.Class diagram for Notification System
image::NotificationClassDiagram.png[]

The Notification System is facilitated by the  `NotificationManager`, which is found in the Logic component. Other constituent classes of the Notification System can be found in the Logic and UI components, depending on their functionality. These classes and their functionalities are listed below:

===== *Logic Classes*
Logic classes are responsible for deciding if a notification should be posted. As with other components, their functionality is accessed through the `NotificationManager` class. The `NotificationManager` class maintains a reference to a `NotificationCheckingThread` as well as a `SystemTrayCommunicator`.

The logic classes of the Notification System can be found under the `notification` package under the `Logic` component.

- The `NotificationCheckingThread` is a daemon thread that runs in parallel with the main application. It checks for new notifications to post every minute.
- The `NotificationChecker` is responsible for checking `Model` for any notifications that need to be posted.

===== *UI Classes*
UI classes are responsible for displaying notifications to the user.

The UI classes of the Notification System can be found under the `systemtray` package under the `ui` component.

- The `PopupListener` class is the main channel of communication between the logic and UI classes. When a notification needs to be posted, it will relay the information from the logic to UI classes.
- The `SystemTrayCommunicator` handles posting notifications and displaying the app's icon on the System Tray. It listens to the `NotificationCheckingThread` through a `PopupListener`.
- The `PopupNotification` class carries the information that will be posted to a popup notification.
- The `NotificationClickActionListener` is called when the user clicks on a popup notification.

==== Class Activity
As with other Manager classes, an instance of the  `NotificationManager` is created upon the starting of MainApp. The NotificationManager proceeds to initialize and run a `NotificationCheckingThread`, as well as a `SystemTrayCommunicator`. Upon being started, the `NotificationCheckingThread` will enter a `notificationCheckingLoop` by calling its method of the same name.

To give a better explanation of how the `NotificationCheckingThread` works, a single run of its loop is illustrated below:

.Sequence diagram for NotificationCheckingThread's main loop
image::NotificationCheckingLoopSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1. The `NotificationCheckingThread` calls the `NotificationChecker` to generate `PopupNotification`s through a call to `NotificationChecker#getListOfPopupNotifications()`

Step 2. For each `PopupNotification` generated by the NotificationChecker, a call to `PopupListener#notify()` is made.

Step 3. This prompts the `SystemTrayCommunicator` to post a new notification.

Step 4. The `NotificationCheckingThread` sleeps until the start of the next minute, found by the method `NotificationCheckingThread#findMillisecondsToNextMinute()`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the Notification system should run
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Running the Notification system as a separate thread in the same application
** Pros: Easier to implement and test.
** Cons: The user would have to leave the application on if they always wanted to be notified.
* **Alternative 2:** Running the Notification system as a background application
** Pros: This would allow notifications to be posted to the user's desktop even if the Horo main app were not open.
** Cons: This would require the creation of a separate application that the user would have to install on their computer. Because different Java applications are ran in different instances of Java Virtual Machines, this could vastly complicate implementation as the Notification System and the rest Horo would be unable to interact directly.

Alternative 1 was eventually chosen as it was simpler to implement and test, and remain within the initial scope of Horo's development. The application can be potentially changed to use Alternative 2 in the future.
