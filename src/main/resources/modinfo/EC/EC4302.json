    "description": "This module is divided into two sections; long\u2010 and short\u2010 run macro\u2010economic analysis. In the first section, we shall discuss various theories of economic growth using inter\u2010temporal optimization models, which include neo\u2010classical growth models and overlapping\u2010generations models. In the second section, we shall add stochastic elements to the standard neo\u2010classical growth model and use it to study business cycles. Our focus will be to highlight the similarities and differences between the Real Business Cycle and New\u2010Keynesian Models. This course is suitable for students intending to pursue graduate studies or quantitative research (in ministries, statutory boards, etc.) in Economics.",
