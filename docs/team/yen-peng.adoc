== Project Portfolio for ORGANice

The purpose of this project portfolio is to present my main contributions to ORGANice.

:sectnums:
== Introduction

This section covers the project scope and description, followed an explanation of the formats used.

=== Project scope

ORGANice is the product of a software engineering project done by a team of 5 students, including myself, who are second-year Computer Science students from the National University of Singapore (NUS).
Under a two-month-long time frame, we conceptualised ORGANice and molded it from an existing application, known as "Address Book", that stores and manages people's contact information.
My role in this project is to design and write the code for the `list` and `sort` features for ORGANice, and to offer advice for the design aspect of the application.
For the languages used, ORGANice is written in Java while its Graphical User Interface (GUI) is written in JavaFX.

=== Project description

ORGANice is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application, meaning that user interaction is mainly through typing in commands.
This application is targeted at hospital administrators and its main features include storing hospital information,
finding compatible donors for patients awaiting organ transplants, and following up on administrative matters related to the organ matching process.

**ORGANice has the following features:**

* Maintain the information of doctors, donors, and patients using `add` and `edit`
* Find information quickly using `find` and `list`
* Match compatible organ donors with patients and sort the matches using `match` and `sort`
* Keep track of patient-donor pairs slated for further compatibility tests using `processing` and subsequent administrative tasks using `processingmarkdone`
* Mark patient-donor pair as `done` to remove from future matching results

=== Meaning of the formats used

The following is a list of various formats used and what they mean:

* `sort`  --  Purple texts are technical terms used in this project.
* https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/153[#153]  --  Blue underlined texts consist of a link that opens up a relevant webpage.

== Summary of Contributions

This section elaborates on the enhancements I did to ORGANice with the relevant links (in blue).

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to sort matches according to different criteria. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/145[#145])
** What it does: Allows the user to sort patient-donor pairs according to compatibility rate, the priority of the patients, or donors' organ expiry date.
** Justification: Helps the hospital to make more informed decisions after knowing which pairs are the most compatible, which patient to prioritize, and which organs are expiring soon respectively.
** Highlights: Able to add in more sorting options in future enhancements. The implementation is challenging as it required an in-depth analysis of how the match feature is implemented.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a list feature that allows the user to list down all persons or persons of a specified type in ORGANice. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/113[#113])

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an organ class to ORGANice. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/86[#86])

* *Minor enhancement*: Designed the logo of ORGANice, and updated the application window to display title and logo. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/136[#136])

== Contributions to the User Guide

This section showcases my ability to write documentation targeting end-users through an excerpt of what I have written for the User Guide,
and this includes the `sort`, `list`, `help` and `edit` features.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

This section showcases my ability to write technical documentation and to visually represent a system using
Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams in the Developer Guide. The sequence shown in the excerpt below will be use cases for
`list` and `sort` features, followed by their implementations, and lastly, the `Model` class diagram that I have updated.
