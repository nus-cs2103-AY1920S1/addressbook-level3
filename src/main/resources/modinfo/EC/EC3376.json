The tutorials focus on individual economic and political country profiles of the EU\u2019s current and future member states. The objective is to give students a sound background to evaluate the EU\u2019s and her member states current and future economic and political situation and to study the evolution and the problems of regional integration in using the world\u2019s most advanced model case. As the course is interdisciplinary in nature (covering economics, politics, contemporary history and law), interested students from other faculties are encouraged to attend. Basic economic literacy and some knowledge of European history and politics are a definite plus.",
