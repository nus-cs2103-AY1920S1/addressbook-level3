== Introduction

Xpire is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expiry dates of items*. More importantly, Xpire is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have trouble tracking your items' expiry dates, Xpire can help you manage and notify you of items that are soon-expiring. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `xpire.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Xpire.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `*view*` : views all items
* `*check*|20` : views items that is going to expire within the given number of days
* `*add*|Banana|25/9/2019` : adds an item named `Banana` with expiry date `25/9/2019` to list.
* `*delete*|3` : deletes the 3rd item shown in the current list
* `*exit*` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
