    "description": "This course examines poetic tradition in three major religions of the world: Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity. Why does the divine voice express so often itself through poetry? Why is poetry the privileged vehicle in which communications between the divine and the human occur? Cross-cultural problems we will study: the body and soul, devotion, mysticism, the lyric voice, revealed scripture and tradition, theological disputes, the gaze, desire, gender, eros, allegory.",
