This page showcases my contribution to the SecureIT project.

== PROJECT: SecureIT

=== Overview

SecureIT is an application to help manage your confidential information.
More importantly, it *stores your information locally,*  and does not use any form of online storage!

SecureIT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Here's a sneak peak of our application:

== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*

Implemented a series of commands to manage the user's password. This includes adding a `Password` model
and its subclasses of `Description`, `Username`, `PasswordValue`, `Website`, `PasswordModifiedAt`, `PasswordExpiredAt`, `ExpiryMode`.

In addition,
I implemented the supportive commands to the password model such as `AddPasswordCommand`, `FindPasswordCommand`, `CopyPasswordCommand`, `DeletePasswordCommand`,
`ReadPasswordCommand` and `EditPasswordCommand`.

*What it does*

* Allows the user to manage their passwords and keep track of the expiry dates of the passwords.

*Justification*

* Many small and medium enterprises now have a plethora of accounts to use for day-to-day activities.
It is hard to keep track of all the passwords without compromising on security. This feature aims to alleviate the password management
on businesses and improve data security.

*Highlights*

*  A new `Password` model was created to support the management of passwords.
Numerous commands were also implemented for this enhancement.
This enhancement requires in depth analysis of the current structure of the architecture
as it touches every component of the architecture.
In addition, many Software Engineering Principles, such as *SOLID*, *YAGNI* and *DRY* Principles, were used.
Defensive programming is also evident throughout the enhancement.

*Minor enhancement*
Designed the UI of the current application by adding in a `ReadDisplayPanel` and `ModeDisplay`.
