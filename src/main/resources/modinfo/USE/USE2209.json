    "description": "Growing up with social media, cinema, the Internet, and more, you have had the globe at your fingertips. But have you probed effects of this accessibility on your ability to act as an independent, adaptable thinker and doer? Have visualist media encouraged you to act as a spectator, only, rather than as a curious (maybe courageous) world citizen when you study abroad, travel, consider foreign-labor or migrancy issues, or seek employment? This module explores integrity, openness and expressivity through one strand of identity, Asian-Pacificness.",
