    "description": "The objective of this module is to give students opportunity to critique current papers in biochemical engineering and provide practical understanding of cell culture and purification methods. Students will critique scientific impact of protein therapeutics and engineering aspects of recombinant protein production at commercial scales. They will be introduced to bioreactors, media design and analytical methods for cell culture. This is followed by topics on protein purification, and analytical methods of structure and function. Two practical sessions include culture of animal cells to produce, purify and characterise antibodies, SDS Page, western blots and ELISAs. This is a postgraduate module targeted at students who are interested in bioprocesses such as animal cell culture and protein purification.",
