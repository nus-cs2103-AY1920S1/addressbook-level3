== Introduction
This portfolio provides an overview of the CS2103/T Revision Tool and highlights my contribution in the project
including a brief description of the key features that I implemented.

=== The Team
Our team of 5 consists of 2 Year 4 Engineering Science students, a Year 4 Industrial & Systems Engineering student,
a Year 3 Communications & New Media student and a Year 2 Computer Science / Business student.

=== About the Project

This 7-week project was started as part of NUS' Software Engineering (CS2103/T) module. The team was required to
to either morph or enhance an existing application (link:{ab3Url}/[Address Book - Level 3]). Our team decided to morph the project
into the CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT) a desktop quiz application which allows users to create customised question banks
and attempt the quizzes in an interactive manner. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *short answer questions functionality to the application*
** What it does: allows the user to answer questions that are open ended in nature.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can add and answer questions that cannot be formatted in MCQs or TrueFalse questions style.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of external Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries to analyse the user input to determine whether the user answered the SAQs correctly. The implementation was challenging
as String processing is required and many edge cases had to be taken into account as user could input anything as the answer.
** Credits: StanfordCoreNLP Library and FuzzyWuzzy Library

* *Minor enhancement*: helped with minor UI enhancements to display different types of questions correctly.

* *Code contributed*: view my code contributions https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=neoshh&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[here]

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
*** Added FAQs to user guide
*** Added all the user stories for the project to the developer guide.
** Community:
*** Reviewed and merged PRs
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library, StanfordCoreNLP and FuzzyWuzzy, to the project


== Contributions to the User Guide

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

=== Adding SAQ: `add`

Adds a SAQ to the question bank

Format: `add type/saq q/QUESTION cat/CATEGORY diff/DIFFICULTY y/CORRECT_ANSWER ... `

****
[%hardbreaks]
The following are the valid answer formats for SAQ:
*SAQ*: Multiple correct answers, no wrong answers.
****

Examples:

* `add type/saq q/What does UML stands for? cat/cs2103 diff/1 y/unified modeling language`

****
[%hardbreaks]
*NOTE*:
Answer to the SAQ cannot be "exit".
Answer cannot appear in the question
(eg. q/What is UML diagram? y/UML Diagram).
****

=== Hints `[coming in v2.0]`

User will be able to get hints for MCQs and SAQs. Typing '/hint' for MCQs will eliminate two wrong answers from the
options, leaving user with two options, one of which is correct. Typing '/hint' for SAQs will show the user random
keywords from the correct answer list.

=== Pictures/Diagrams `[coming in v2.0]`

User will be able to upload pictures and diagrams as part of the questions when adding questions to the test bank.


=== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the
data of your previous question bank folder.

*Q*: Why am I not able to click on the options to select the answers for MCQs and T/F questions? +
*A*: The options are there as a way to show the users the options available. As this is a CLI application, the main
input will be through keyboard inputs.

*Q*: Can I use this application for another module? +
*A*: Yes you can. This application is designed to store any types of MCQs, T/F and SAQs.

*Q*: I want to challenge my friends using this application, how can I do it? +
*A*: There is no online support for the application right now. One way you can chanllenge your friend is to prepare the
same json files and load it up to your individual computers and do the quiz together.

=== Saq feature
==== How Saq works
The Saq input mechanism is facilitated by `SaqInputCommand`. It extends `Command` and execute the `CommandResult`. The input
will be  parse into `SaqInputCommandParser` to check for input validity. If the input String is not valid (i.e the String
does not start with a letter of number), an invalid command parse exception will be thrown, indicating to user that the
input String requires a letter or a number at the start of the String.

If the input is valid, `SaqInputCommand` object of type `Command` will be created. The execute command of the
`SaqInputCommand` object will be executed. The execute command will call the `isCorrect` method of Saq to check if the
user input is correct or not.

The activity diagram below shows the steps the user takes to answer an SAQ.

==== NLP Libraries
External libraries were used to determine if the user input is correct or not. `StanfordCoreNLP` library was used to
check for sentimental value of user input and the list of correct answers. This helps to check for negative sentence
against a neutral or positive sentence (eg. "not a uml diagram" and "it's a uml diagram"). The `FuzzyWuzzy` library was
also used to determine the similarity percentage of the user input to the correct answer using fuzzy string matching
technique.

The class diagram below shows the relationship between the classes that are used to validate the correctness of the
user input.

==== Validating the answer
The `execute` method will return the `CommandResult`, correct or wrong. The currentAnswerable of type `Saq` will call its
`isCorrect` method and return a boolean value, true for correct answer and false for wrong answer. The sequence diagram
below shows the steps taken by the `isCorrect` method to determine if the user input is correct or wrong.
