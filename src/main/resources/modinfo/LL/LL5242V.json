    "description": "The course will include various aspects of financial regulation. The focus will be on the regulation of credit institutions and the role of central banks. Other forms of regulation of financial intermediaries and financial markets will be discussed in less detail. Since the focus will be on credit institutions, it will be important that the students understand what distinguishes credit institutions from other providers of financial services and how the regulatory approaches differ. The part on the regulation of credit institutions will include requirements for their authorization, their permanent supervision and rescue scenarios in situations of insolvency and default. These aspects will be discussed from a comparative perspective with the Basel requirements at the core of the discussion, complemented by the implementing norms in important jurisdictions, above all in Singapore. For resolution and restructuring the European Union has taken on a leading role, and, as a consequence, these EU approaches will be analysed in detail. The roles of central banks will remain a core part of the course. Their tasks and objectives will be discussed from a comparative perspective. Their essential role in crisis management, their co-operation with supervisory agencies and their monetary policy will remain essential components of the course.",
