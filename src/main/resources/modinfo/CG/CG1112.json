    "description": "This module will be for the students who have completed EPP I and the project scope extends to handle challenges in large-scale systems. Similar to EPP I, students will first learn the fundamental principles on certain advanced concepts and then design and programme a real-world system. The module involves designing a complex computer engineering system that facilitates information processing, real-world interfacing, and understanding the effects of certain useful metrics such as, scaling, safety, security, sustainability, societal impact, fault-tolerant design, etc.",
