    "description": "This module will expose our graduate students to the cutting-edge knowledge of RNA biology and their implications in human diseases. We will discuss landmark studies that offer a historical perspective as well as read papers from the latest issues of scientific journals to learn about the most recent findings in this rapidly evolving field. We will discover how cell processes are regulated by RNAs, RNA-binding proteins and the ribonucleoprotein complex, how changes in RNAs can lead to disease, and how we can explore the therapeutic potential of RNAs, using lectures and journal clubs given by clinical and basic science experts.",
