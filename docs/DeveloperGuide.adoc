=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width=70%, scaledwidth=70%]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/Main.java[`Main`]
and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-UiLogic,*`UiLogic`*>>: The UI action handler.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

*API* :
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DetailsTabPane`, `DisplayTabPane`, `TaskManagementPane`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

// end::design-ui[]
.Structure of the DisplayTabPane Component
image::UiDisplayTabClassDiagram.png[width="100%", scaledwidth=18cm]
// tag::design-ui[]

The `DetailsTabPane` consists of `FindRuleListPanel`, `PlanListPanel`, `ProblemListPanel` and `TagListPanel`,
which are used for displaying entries of `FindRule`, `Plan`, `Problem` and `Tag` stored in AlgoBase respectively.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/algobase/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

.  `Logic` uses the `AlgoBaseParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a problem).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteprob 1")` API call.

.  Performing an action (e.g. switching tabs) triggers the creation of a `UiActionDetails` object.
.  `UiLogic` uses the `AlgoBaseUiActionParser` class to parse the `UiActionDetails` object.
.  This results in a `UiAction` object which is executed by the `UiLogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. deleting a problem).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `UiActionResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `UiActionResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the results as feedback to the user.

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the AlgoBase data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Problem>`, `ObservableList<Tag>`, `ObservableList<Plan>`, `ObservableList<Task>`, `ObservableList<ProblemSearchRule>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

We organize different data classes into packages (e.g. `Problem`), inside which we provide a collection class of that data object (e.g. `UniqueProblemList`) so that `AlgoBase` can manage these data objects without knowing the details of each data class.

.Structure of the Problem Package

=== Task Management Feature

As an algorithmic problem management tool, one of the most important features will be managing tasks that have been done
or are to be done.

This section will describe in details the current implementation and design considerations of
the task management feature.

==== Current Implementation

The task management feature supports eight main operations:

* `AddTask` - creates a new task for a problem and add it to a specified plan.
* `CopyTask` - copies a task from one plan to another.
* `DeleteTask` - deletes an existing task from a specified plan.
* `DoneTask` - marks a task as done in a specified plan.
* `EditTask` - edits the due date of a task in a specified plan.
* `MoveTask` - moves a task from one plan to another.
* `SetPlan` - sets a plan as the current plan in main display.
* `UndoneTask` - marks a task as undone in a specified plan.

This feature is mainly supported by the `Task` class.
Given below is the class diagram of the `Task` class.

.Class Diagram for Task
image::task/HighLevelTaskClassDiagram.png[width="40%", scaledwidth=8cm]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding tasks behaves at each step.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddTaskCommand`:

.Activity Diagram for the Execution of `AddTaskCommand`
image::task/AddTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="100%", scaledwidth=18cm]

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. AlgoBase displays a list of existing problems and plans in the UI.

Step 3. The user executes `addtask plan/1 prob/1` to add the problem with index 1 in the list to the plan with index 1.
The `AddTaskCommand` calls `Model#updateTasks` to create a new plan from the original plan with this additional task,
and replace the original plan with this updated plan in the `PlanList` stored in `AlgoBase`.

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how AlgoBase processes user request
to execute `addtask plan/1 prob/1`:

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` components
while executing `AddTaskCommand`:

.Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `AddTaskCommand`
image::task/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width="100%", scaledwidth=18cm]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the task commands.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a `HashSet` to store tasks in a plan.
** Pros: Duplicate tasks can be checked easily.
** Cons: Harder to identify tasks by index.
* Alternative 2: Use an `ArrayList` to store tasks in a plan.
** Pros: Tasks can be identified by index easily.
** Cons: Harder to check for duplicate tasks.

===== Aspect: How to store problem details within tasks to support the task commands.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Store a problem object in each task.
** Pros: Changes in problem details will be reflected in the relevant tasks as well.
** Cons: Relational storage is required to keep track of this relationship.
* Alternative 2: Copy all problem details and store as separate fields in each task.
** Pros: No need to implement relational storage. There will be less coupling between problems and tasks as well.
** Cons: Changes in problem details cannot be reflected in the relevant tasks easily.

===== Aspect: Relational storage to support the task commands.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use an additional `id` field to identify problems and tasks.
** Pros: The id field is kept immutable over time, thus ensuring integrity.
** Cons: An additional field is needed for the models.
* Alternative 2: Use object hash to identify problems and tasks.
** Pros: No need to store another additional field in the models.
** Cons: Object hash can change over time.

=== Tag feature

==== Implementation
The tag mechanism is facilitated by UniqueTagList. It creates a list of Tag, stored internally as an uniqueTagList. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddTag` - creates a new tag in AlgoBase's uniqueTagList in the algobase history.
* `DeleteTag` - deletes a current tag which have already in the uniqueTagList.
* `EditTag` - edits the current tag name which have already been in the `uniqueTagList`.
* `ListTag` - shows the tags in the uniqueTagList in the algobase GUI for users.

.Class Diagram for Tag
image::tag/TagClassDiagram.png[width="60%", scaledwidth=6cm]

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addTag()`, `Model#deleteTag()`, `Model#listTag()` and `Model#editTag()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The UniqueTagList will be initialized with the initial algobase state

Step 2. The user executes `addtag t/easy` to add a tag named [easy] with default color which have not applied in any problems. The addtag command calls `Model#addtag()`, causing the taglist added a tag after the ‘addtag t/easy’ command executes to be saved in the uniqueTagList.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addtag` operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for `AddTagCommand`
image::tag/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="80%", scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 3. The user decides to execute the command `listtag` to show a tag list in the GUI of algobase. The `listtag` command calls `Model#listtag()`, causing the taglist shows the current components of uniqueTagList. Commands that do not modify the data, such as `listtag`, will not call `Model#addTag()`, `Model#deleteTag()` or `Model#editTag()`. Thus the `uniqueTagList` remains unchanged.

Step 4.The user executes `edittag 1 t/hard c/BLUE` to edit the current tag [easy] to [hard] in the `uniqueTagList`. The `edittag 1 t/hard c/BLUE`
Command executes `edittag`, causing the taglist find the tag with index 1 in the tag list and change tag [easy] into [hard] and change tag color from default color to blue, and change all [easy] tag into [hard] in blue color in all problems.

Step 5. The user executes `deletetag t/hard` to delete the current tag [easy] in the uniqueTagList. The `deletetag t/hard` command executes `deletetag`, causing the taglist delete the [hard] tag in uniqueTagList and [hard] tag in all problems.
(diagram)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new tag modifying command

.Activity Diagram for tag commands
image::tag/TagCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="80%", scaledwidth=12cm]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the tag commands.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a list in current AlgoBase to save the content of different tags which used in tagging different problems. While problems create new tags for problems, it will also add into tag-list in AlgoBase. While the tag in problems changes, the tag in tag-list will not change and add a new tag into the tag-list in AlgoBase. While modifying tag in tag-list will change the tag for all related problem.
** Pros: Users can manage the tags conveniently.
** Cons: May lead to many tags do not combine with problems.
* Alternative 2: Simply keep tags as a part of problems. While execute the tag command will search for all tags in problems for every times it execute.
** Pros: No need to save the tag separately in the storage, all tags are under problems.
** Cons: Difficult to manage tags in different problems. Waste time for computer to execute.

=== Find Problem Feature

Since AlgoBase is a management tool for algorithmic questions, the search functionality is crucial to the user’s experience with AlgoBase. For instance, the planning feature heavily relies on `findprob` command to determine the exact set of problems the user wants to include in a training plan.

This section will describe in detail the current implementation and design considerations of the find problem feature (i.e. search feature) of AlgoBase.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `findprob` command:

.Activity Diagram for the Execution of `findprob` Command
image::find/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="80%", scaledwidth=12cm]

==== Current Implementation

The find problem feature mainly involves three parts:

1. validating and parsing user input
2. creating a filtering predicate from user’s search constraints
3. update the displayed problem list with the filtering predicate.

The find problem feature is facilitated by the following classes:

* `FindProblemDescriptor`
+
It stores predicates that are needed to describe a `FindCommand`
+
Additionally, it implements the following operation(s):
+
** `FindProblemDescriptor#isAnyFieldProvided()` - Determines if there is at least one search restriction included in this instance of `FindProblemDescriptor`.
** `FindProblemDescriptor#equals(...)` - Two instances of `FindProblemDescriptor` are equal if and only if all of their predicates are equal.
* `FindCommandParser`
It validates and parses user input to an instance of `FindCommand`.

[NOTE]
If the user provides difficulty range as one of the search restrictions, `FindCommandParser` expects the format `LOWER_BOUND \<= difficulty \<= UPPER_BOUND` while `LOWER_BOUND` and `UPPER_BOUND` are valid strings for doubles (i.e. parsable by `Double.parseDouble(...)`).

* `FindCommand`
+
It creates and stores the `predicate` from an instance of `FindProblemDescriptor`. `predicate` is used to perform the filtering of the displayed problem list when the command is executed.
+
`predicate` returns true only when the provided problem fulfills all restrictions described by the provided instance of `FindProblemDescriptor`.
+
Additionally, it implements the following operation(s):
+
** `FindCommand#execute(...)` - This method overrides `Command#execute(...)`. It filters problems in `filteredProblemList` in `model` with `predicate`.
** `FindCommand#equals(...)` - Two instances of `FindCommand` are equal if and only if their `predicate` are equal.

.Class Diagram of the Find Feature
image::find/FindCommandClassDiagram.png[width="75%", scaledwidth=12cm]

* Predicates that implements interface `Predicate<Problem>`
+
These are classes that describes whether an instance of `Problem` is considered a match under a certain field with provided keyword(s).
+
** `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`
*** It ignores case.
*** It returns true as long as one of the keywords appear in the name as a word. (“As a word” means the matching is done word by word. For instance, `hello` doesn’t match `helloworld`.)
** `AuthorMatchesKeywordPredicate`
*** It is case sensitive and matches the entire author string (i.e. requires an exact match).
** `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate`
*** It ignores case.
*** It returns true only when all of the keywords appear in the description as a word.
** `SourceMatchesKeywordPredicate`
*** It requires an exact match.
** `DifficultyIsInRangePredicate`
*** It matches problems with LOWER_BOUND \<= difficulty \<= UPPER_BOUND
** `TagIncludesKeywordsPredicate`
*** Each keyword will be considered as a tag, and two tags are considered equal only when their names are exactly the same (i.e. an exact match).
*** It returns true when the provided tags are a subset of the tags of the provided problem.

.Class Diagram for Predicates in the Find Feature
image::find/PredicateClassDiagram.png[width="40%", scaledwidth=10cm]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find problem mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `findprob t/recursion diff/2.0-4.0` to find a problem with a tag “recursion” and difficulty between 2.0 and 4.0.

Step 2. `FindCommandParser` processes the user input and returns a `FindCommand` instance with the information of user’s search restrictions.

[NOTE]
If no valid search restriction is provided by the user, `FindCommandParser` will throw a parsing exception, which is handled and displayed to the user.

Step 3. `LogicManager` invokes `execute()` method of the returned `FindCommand`. `FindCommand` updates the problem list with user’s search constraints.

.Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `findprob` Command
image::find/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=18cm]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to update the displayed problem list in the UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let UI display problems in a `FilteredList<Problem>` and update the displayed problem by calling `setPredicate` on the `FilteredList`.
** Pros: Provides good protection over unexpected changes on the displayed problem list.
** Cons: Need to write a complex logic to generate one predicate out of multiple search constraints.
* **Alternative 2:** Let UI displays problems in an `ObservableList<Problem>` and update the list directly.
** Pros: The implementation would be more straightforward as the logic can update the displayed list directly.
** Cons: Leaves room for potential unexpected changes on the displayed problem list as the observable list is open to any kind of operation.

===== Aspect: How to deal with the case where no search restriction is provided (i.e. user types in `findprob` with no arguments given)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Treat it as an exception and notify the user to provide at least one constraint.
** Pros: Makes the meaning of `findprob` command clear - you can’t search for problems without giving any conditions.
** Cons: Has to check there is at least one predicate provided, making the implementation a bit more complicated.
* **Alternative 2:** Treat it as no restriction (i.e. `findprob` is equivalent to `list` in this case)
** Pros: Easier implementation (if all predicates are always-true predicates, using `.and` method to chain them together would naturally result in an always-true predicate).
** Cons: Confusing definition of the search feature.

===== Aspect: How to make predicates optional (i.e. user doesn’t have to provide restrictions for all searchable fields)

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `FindProblemDescriptor` in which the getter for the predicate returns `Optional<Predicate>`.
** Pros: If the parser doesn’t receive keyword(s) for a specific field, it simply doesn’t call the descriptor’s setter for that field. It doesn’t need to deal with `null`, and `null` is dealt gracefully using `Optional.ofNullable(...)`
** Cons: Rather troublesome implementation of the descriptor.
* **Altermative 2:** Store predicates in `FindProblemCommand` and check for not-provided predicates by comparing it with `null`.
** Pros: More straightforward implementation.
** Cons: If we are to add more predicates, it’s more likely that we forget to check `null` value of the new predicate.

// tag::savefindrule[]

=== Save Find Rules Feature

AlgoBase provides many ways to organizing your problems including tags and plans. However, both organizing features require persistent user involvement - if the user added a new problem belonging to a category, the user needs to manually assign a tag to the problem or add the problem to a plan. Since AlgoBase's `findprob` command enables the user to filter problems with great flexibility, we allow them to save certain find rules so that they can re-apply these rules to quickly locate problems of their need.

This section will describe in detail the current implementation and design considerations of the save find rules (or problem search rules) feature of AlgoBase.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `addfindrule` command:

.Activity Diagram for the Execution of `addfindrule` Command
image::savefindrule/AddFindRuleActivityDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

==== Current Implementation

The save find rules feature is facilitated by the following classes:

* `ProblemSearchRule` +
It stores both the `Name` of the find rule and all predicates included in this find rule. A `ProblemSearchRule` doesn't have to include all possible predicates as the user may not provide all of them. Missing predicates will be stored as `null` in this class.
* `UniqueFindRuleList` +
It stores the find rules and makes sure that every find rule in this list has a unique name.
** `UniqueFindRuleList` stores a `ObservableList<ProblemSearchRule>` for UI purposes.

[NOTE]
Except for `ProblemSearchRule`, we refer to these rules as `FindRule` in all other places. This is to prevent possible naming conflicts if AlgoBase is to support saving find rules on other items (e.g. Plans, etc.). `FindRule` corresponds to `FindCommand`. Thus, if you are to implement saving find plan rules, name them as `PlanSearchRule`, `AddFindPlanRuleCommand`, `UniqueFindPlanRuleList`, etc.

Under the category of save find rules feature, we have the following `Command` classes and their corresponding `Parser` classes:

* `AddFindRuleCommand`
* `DeleteFindRuleCommand`
* `ApplyCommand` +
It applies a problem-finding rule by specifying the index of the displayed find rule.

Since these commands share similar implementations, we will only take `AddFindRuleCommand` as an example since it's the most complicated one among the three.

===== Implementation of `addfindrule` feature

The `addfindrule` feature is facilitated by `AddFindRuleCommand` and `AddFindRuleCommandParser` class.

.Class Diagram for Add Find Rule Feature
image::savefindrule/AddFindRuleClassDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

The sequence diagram below shows the high-level abstraction of how AlgoBase processes the request when user types in `addfindrule rule1 n/Sequences`:

.High-level Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `addfindrule rule1 n/Sequences`
image::savefindrule/HighLevelAddFindRuleSequenceDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component when executing `AddFindRuleCommand`. Notice that the constructor for `ProblemSearchRule` requires `Name` to be non-null and accepts null values for other predicates. Thus if the predicate is not present in the arguments, `AddFindRuleCommandParser` will pass null to the constructor of `ProblemSearchRule`.

.Sequence Diagram for the Execution of `addfindrule` Command
image::savefindrule/AddFindRuleSequenceDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=18cm]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: To implement `ProblemSearchRule` as a subclass of `FindProblemDescriptor` or implement it as an immutable concrete class.

Since AlgoBase is forked from AddressBook 3, it also inherits AB3's design choice on all data classes - they are all immutable classes with all fields being `final`. However, `ProblemSearchRule` is essentially saving the information of a command input, where the user may provide any number of predicates as the argument. We implement mutable `FindProblemDescriptor` to accommodate variable user inputs, now we have to consider whether to keep `ProblemSearchRule` immutable or not.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ProblemSearchRule` extends `FindProblemDescriptor` with an additional field `name`
** Pros: Greatly reduces the amount of duplicate code as `ProblemSearchRule` shares most fields with `FindProblemDescriptor`
** Cons: `ProblemSearchRule` as a data class is no longer immutable. We have to be careful not to call any setters it inherits from `FindProblemDescriptor`.
* **Alternative 2:** `ProblemSearchRule` as an individual class with immutable fields.
** Pros: Provides good protection over unexpected changes to the data fields.
** Cons: Lots of duplicated code.

=== Graphical User Interface Features

An intuitive GUI facilitates the overall user friendliness of the application.
The user should be able to navigate around the application easily to facilitate a smooth experience using AlgoBase.
While the command line is fast for typing short commands, it us not ideal if the user is editing large amounts of text (e.g. when the user is adding description for a new problem).
In this case, having a GUI will be more beneficial to the user and facilitates a smoother user experience.

Additionally, multitasking is important as a user may be tackling multiple algorithmic questions at a single time.
This, we introduced tabbing, which facilitates multitasking in AlgoBase, which is an important requirement for competitive programmers.

==== Graphical User Interface Enhancements

===== Current Implementation

The following classes facilitate the handling of GUI actions:

* `UiActionType` - An Enum of the types of UI actions that exist in AlgoBase.
* `UiActionDetails` - An object containing details of a UI action.
* `UiAction` - Interface with instructions for executing a UI action.
* `UiLogicManager` - Implements  `Uilogic` and manages the overall UI Logic.
* `AlgoBaseUiActionParser` - Parses a `UiActionDetails` object into an implementation of `UiAction`.
* `UiActionResult` - The result of executing the UI action.

When the user makes a change in the GUI, the change is propagated from `Ui` to `UiLogic` to `Model` and to `Storage`, as represented in the diagram below:

.An example of a high level representation of the GUI Actions.
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram1.png[width=70%, scaledwidth=13cm]

This process of how the application handles UI Actions is captured by the example in the Sequence Diagrams below:

.Interaction between `UI` and `UiLogic`
image::gui/EditProblemUiActionSequenceDiagram0.png[width=100%, scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 1: The user edits the `ProblemDetails` controller class through his/her actions in the GUI.

Step 2: The `ProblemDetails` class constructs a new `UiActionDetails` object of type `UiActionType.EditProblem`.

Step 3: The `executeUiAction` of the `MainWindow` class is called with the `UiActionDetails` object,
which in turn calls the `execute` method of `UiLogicManager`.

Step 4: The method call returns a `UiActionResult` object, which may optionally contain feedback for the user.

The following diagram goes into more details on how the `UiLogic` handles the `UiActionDetails`:

.Interactions between classes in the `UiLogic` component.
image::gui/EditProblemUiActionSequenceDiagram1.png[width=100%, scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 1: The `UiLogicManager` passes the `UiActionDetails` object to the `AlgoBaseUiActionParser`,
which in turn passes it to the `EditProblemUiActionParser` based on its Action type.

Step 2: The `EditProblemUiActionParser` converts the `UiActionDetails` object into a `EditProblemUiAction` object,
and passes it back to the `UiLogicManager`.

Step 3: The `UiLogicManager` executes the `EditProblemUiAction` together with the `Model`, and returns the `UiActionResult`.

==== Graphical User Interface State

===== Current Implementation

The state of the GUI is stored in a `GuiState` object, which is in turn stored in the `Model`. The `GuiState` object contains a `TabManager` object, which manages tab information such as the tabs that are open and the tabs that are currently selected.

The following class diagram illustrates how the classes in the `GuiState` interact with one another:

.Class Diagram for the `GuiState` class
image::design/model/GuiPackageDiagram.png[width=60%, scaledwidth=10cm]

The following Activity diagram illustrates the series of actions that occur when the user opens a new tab:

.Activity Diagram for Opening a new Tab from the GUI
image::gui/OpenTabUiActionActivityDiagram.png[scaledwidth=18cm]

In AlgoBase, the state of the GUI is also saved to Storage after every action. This is so that when the user closes the application and opens it again later, the state is stored.
The Sequence diagram below also shows how the GuiState is saved to Storage:

[.text-center]
.Sequence Diagram for storing new GUI state
image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram3.png[width=100%, scaledwidth=14cm]

The `StorageManager` saves the modified `GuiState` as a new `JSON` file.
This is done with the help of the `JsonSerializableGui`, `JsonSerializableTabManager` and `JsonSerializableTab` classes that are wrappers for the `GuiState`, `TabManager` and `TabData` classes.
These wrapper classes can be converted into `JSON` format for storage without any data loss.

=== Command Line Tab Management

==== Current Implementation

The following commands facilitate the management of tabs:

* `switchTab` - Switch between tabs within a specified Tab pane.
* `openTab` - Opens a new tab containing details of a model.
* `closeTab` - Closes an existing tab.

These operations are exposed in the `TabManager` class respectively as:

* `SwitchTab`: `TabManager#switchTab`
* `OpenTab`: `TabManager#openTab`
* `CloseTab`: `TabManager#closeTab`

The following Activity Diagrams illustrate what happens when the user executes a `SwitchTabCommand` or `OpenTabCommand`

.Activity Diagram for the Execution of `switchtab` Command
image::gui/SwitchTabCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="50%", scaledwidth=12cm]

.Activity Diagram for the Execution of `opentab` Command
image::gui/OpenTabCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="50%", scaledwidth=12cm]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag mechanism behaves at each step.

.Sequence Diagram for instantiating a `SwitchCommand` object
image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram0.png[scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 1: The user executes `switchtab tt/display i/1` to switch to the first tab in the `display` tabpane.

Step 2: `SwitchTabCommandParser` processes the user input, retrieving the tab type (`display`) and the index (`1`).

Step 3: These two attributes are passed into the constructor of a `SwitchTabCommand` and a corresponding `SwitchTabCommand` object is returned to the LogicManager

.Sequence Diagram for updating the tab index in the TabManager
image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram1.png[scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 4: `LogicManager` invokes `execute()` method of the returned `SwitchTabCommand`, which retrieves the TabManager from the `Model` object. The `setDisplayTabPaneIndex(1)` method is invoked with the index 1 that the `SwitchTabCommand` was instantiated with.

Step 5: Invoking this method updates the integer value in the `displayTabIndex` field (type `ObservableIntegerValue`) of the `TabManager`.

.Sequence Diagram for reflecting the tab changes
image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram2.png[scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 6: A listener was added to the `displayTabIndex` field when the application was initialized. When a change in the value is detected, it triggers the `selectTab(1)` method with the value of the new index passed as an argument. This updates the selected tab in the UI.

.Sequence Diagram for storing new GUI state
image::gui/SwitchTabsSequenceDiagram3.png[scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 7: After the command is executed, the state of the GUI changes. This causes the `StorageManager` to save the modified GUI state as a new `JSON` file.
This is done with the help of the `JsonSerializableGui`, `JsonSerializableTabManager` and `JsonSerializableTab` classes that are wrappers for the `GuiState`, `TabManager` and `TabData` classes.
These wrapper classes can be converted into `JSON` format for storage without any data loss.

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%",cols="33%,<33%,<33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Aspect| Alternative 1 (Current Choice) | Alternative 2
| Implementation of Tab Logic |
Implement Tab Logic separately within model and UI.

**Pros**: Modularizes the logic and reduces the need for tighter coupling between model and UI

**Cons**: Multiple sources of truth and more modules to be implemented
|
Implement Tab Logic as a singular module

**Pros**: Single source of truth for state of tabs

**Cons**: Increasing coupling between Model and UI, which in turn reduces testability
| How to update the tab in the UI |
Using a listener to detect changes to state of tab

**Pros**: Reduces coupling between the `TabManager` class and the UI

**Cons**: As callback functions are utilized, it is not immediately obvious how changes in state of TabManager leads to a change in the UI
|
Updating the UI synchronously

**Pros**: Execution is sequential and it is easier to keep track of the flow of the program.

**Cons**: Increases coupling between the `TabManager` class and the UI and reduces testability.

=== Training Plan Feature

Training plan feature allows users to create customized training plans with specific starting date and end date and that consist of selected problems in AlgoBase. Each problem is wrapped up as a task in the plan. Users can record their progress by marking problems in plans as done or undone, and they can edit, delete or search for plans.

==== Current Implementation

The training plan mechanism is faciliated by `AlgoBase`, which keeps a list of training plans. It supports the following operations:

* `Algobase#addPlan()` -- Adds a new training plan.
* `AlgoBase#setPlan()` -- Replaces an existing plan by an edited version.
* `AlgoBase#removePlan()` -- Deletes a training plan.
* `AlgoBase#getPlanList()` -- Returns a list of training plans.

.Class Diagram of `Plan`
image::plan/PlanClassDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AlgoBase behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AlgoBase` will be initialized with the initial empty state.

Step 2. The user switches to the plan tab and executes `addplan n/CS2040 d/past year questions start/2019-01-01 end/2019-05-04` command to add a new plan to AlgoBase. The `addplan` command checks if `Model#hasPlan()` and calls `Model#addPlan()`, causing the modified state of plans after the `addplan` command executes to be saved in the `PlanList`.

.Sequence Diagram for the execution of `AddPlanCommand`
image::plan/AddPlanSequenceDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

Step 3. The user executes `listplan` to list all plans. The `listplan` command calls `Model#updateFilteredPlanList()`. The plan `CS2040` is numbered `1` in the displayed list.

Step 4. The user finds out that the exam date of CS2040 has changed, and decides to change the end date of the training plan by executing the `editplan 1 end/2019-05-05` command. The `editplan` command will check if `Model#hasPlan()`, and then call `Model#setPlan()` and `Model#updateFilteredPlanList()`, which will replace the original plan with the modified plan in the `PlanList`.

.Activity Diagram for the Execution of `EditPlanCommand`
image::plan/EditPlanCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

[NOTE]
The user can also add value for an empty field by executing `editplan` command if the field has not been specified when adding the plan.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `findplan start/2019-03-01 end/2019-03-31` to find out what plans he has in March. The `findplan` command constructs a `FindPlanDescriptor`, and then executes `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` and `Model#updateFilteredPlanList(FindPlanDescriptor)`. A list of plans in AlgoBase that has overlapping time range with the specified starting date and end date will be displayed on the plan list panel.

.Class Diagram for `FindPlanDescriptor`
image::plan/FindPlanDescriptorClassDiagram.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

[NOTE]
If the user wants to find plans with overlapping time range, both the starting date and the end date should be specified, and the starting date should be before or at least equal to the end date, or an error message will be displayed to inform the user the correct form of input.

Step 6. The user executes `deleteplan 1`, which calls `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` and `Model#deletePlan`. The `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` returns the last shown plan list, which is list of plans returns by the `findplan` command in step 4. Therefore, the first plan with overlapping time range is deleted.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data Structure of TimeRange class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Abstract out a `TimeRange` class in package `plansearchrule`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Generating a `TimeRange` object in `findplan` command adds coupling, and is not very intuitive.
* **Alternative 2:** Abstract out `startDate` and `endDate` fields in plans to a single field `TimeRange` .
** Pros: More OOP (`startDate` and `endDate` are currently `LocalDate` objects).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation complies with other date-related commands and storage of plans, such as adding or editing due dates of tasks in plans and the json file.

===== Aspect: How to find plans with certain tasks

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** By exactly-matching names.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Users need to figure out the exact name of the task they would like to find, which is more time-consuming.
* **Alternative 2:** By indicating index of the original problem.
** Pros: Complies with other usages of prefix `task/`.
** Cons: Adds coupling due to access to `filteredProblemList` in the model.
* **Alternative 3:** By exactly-matching tags of the original problem.
** Pros: User-friendly.
** Cons: Adds coupling due to access to `filteredProblemList` in the model as the wrapped-up task does not have a tag list field.
