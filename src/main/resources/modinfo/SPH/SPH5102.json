Interim and sequential analyses, analysis of multiple treatments and endpoints, stratification and subgroup analyses, as well as meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials will also be discussed. Although particular emphasis is given to the evaluation of treatment in Phase III clinical trials, early phase trials studies will also be covered.",
