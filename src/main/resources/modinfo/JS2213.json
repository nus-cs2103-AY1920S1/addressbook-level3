    "description": "This module provides an introduction to popular culture in contemporary Japan. From the study of various Japanese cultural forms and practices, it explores the linkages between particular practices and subcultures on the one hand, and larger societal trends on the other. The course emphasizes hands-on learning and expects students to engage in first-hand material gathering and observations.  The goal will be to use studies of Japanese popular culture forms to expand critical thinking about globalization, gender roles, race, nationalism in Japan and beyond.",
