    "description": "This course examines anthropological approaches to global development. Students will gain exposure to major transformations in development paradigms and become familiar with various theories and processes for redressing social and economic inequality. Through ethnographic case studies of specific methodological strategies for intervention, students will be able to critically analyse diverse development discourses and practices and evaluate their social consequences, both planned and unintended. Students will also explore the numerous roles anthropologists have played in shaping key debates within development and the discipline\u2019s contributions to understanding the lived experiences of those involved in and effected by development practices.",
