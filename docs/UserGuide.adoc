=== Automatic currency conversion for foreign currencies `[coming in v1.4]`

This automatic conversion allows for the computation of budgets and expenses regardless of their underlying currencies to provide
a cleaner experience when viewing budgets and expenses with multiple differing currencies.

The latest Foreign Exchange data for a limited set of supported currencies are updated whenever the application is launched. The list of supported currencies are as follows:
