    "description": "Entrepreneurship is one of the main factors determining the dynamics of a country's economy. However, Japan has been described as a collectivist society where individual initiative is not appreciated and where it was often the government that led economic development. Yet, Japan has produced a number of extraordinary individuals who played an important role in shaping its economy. Through a series of case studies of dynamic and colourful entrepreneurship the module aims to identify the forces underlying entrepreneurship in Japan, thereby creating a general understanding of the interaction between the individual and its economic, political and social environment.",
