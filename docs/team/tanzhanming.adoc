== 1. Overview

=== 1.1 Introduction

This project portfolio serves to provide a sample of my technical software engineering skills,
by showcasing the work I have done on FinSec - the financial secretary application.
FinSec is developed by a group of 4 students, including myself, as a software engineering project for the module
CS2103T as part of our studies in the National University of Singapore.

The aim of the project was for us, as students, to be able to contribute production quality work to a small to medium
software project.
This was done by letting us morph an existing product - the AddressBook Level 3, into a product of our choice under
certain constraints to mimic a realistic development environment. The main constraint is as follows: The application
should be a CLI-based desktop application. This meant the application should be based around working on a single
computer, and should target users who can type fast or users who prefer typing over other means of input.


=== 1.2 About the product

FinSec is a finance planning and management application that can keep track of various financial statistics such as claim amounts, revenue streams and overall budgets. FinSec is targeted at finance secretaries and
accountants of small organisations, such as those belonging to school clubs or even Small-Medium Enterprises, and aims
to replace Microsoft Excel as their preferred tool to keep track of finances
by providing a core set of specialised features. With its main form of input being the Command Line Interface (CLI), FinSec also favors people who can type fast.

FinSec's main features are as follows.

* FinSec can store information about your expenditure, revenue streams and even point-of-contacts by processing them as
Claims, Incomes and Contacts respectively.
* FinSec splits the Contact, Claim and Income tabs for improved readability and allows you to easily switch between them.
* FinSec can generate prospective Budget values and even provide you with a graph outlining the monetary amounts of Claims, Incomes and Budget for the current month.
* FinSec can map any command to a Shortcut, allowing you to shorten lengthy commands or map them to words that are
easier for you to remember.

The following image shows how FinSec's user interface looks like:

== 2. Summary of contributions
My main role was to design and develop the `help` and `budget` commands. This section shows a summary of my
coding and documentation efforts toward that end, and also highlights other helpful contributions that I had made
towards FinSec.

=== 2.1 Enhancements made

* *Major enhancement 1*: I added the *ability to calculate budget projections*

** What it does: The `budget` command calculates your prospective budget - the balance of money you are expected to
have after handling all your claims and incomes. +
Besides calculating the overall budget, the `budget` command also displays claim, income and budget statistics for the current month via a graphical representation.

** Justification: The main point of a finance management application like FinSec is to keep track of the cashflow in your organisation. The `budget` command does exactly that by calculating and showing you your overall budget.
By providing a clear graphical representation at the same time, it allows you to easily identify certain problems that might arise in the current month - such as the need to raise finance or cash flow difficulties.

** Highlights: This graphical portion of the `budget` command is specifically designed to be incredibly visual and easy
to understand. This is done by varying the colour and width of the lines
used to plot the graph and by implementing tooltips on each data-point. +
The implementation was quite challenging as the library I used for the graphing was not a native one. Thus, I had to
improvise a lot, such as by creating my own custom tooltips for the graph as the default ones provided
did not provide as much clarity as I had wanted.

** Credits: I would like to thank [http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/[JFreeChart]] for their amazing open source library. I had a
much easier time utilising their API to create a graph rather than trying to do so with JavaFx.


* *Major enhancement 2*: I updated the existing `help` command to *provide 3 types of help for each command*.

** What it does: The `help` command by default now opens up a `**HelpWindow**` containing a list of all the FinSec
commands, while the advanced version of `help` with parameters can now provide 3 different types of assistance. +
`brief` - Gives you a short summary of what the command does, how to use it and lists an example. +
`guide` - Opens up your default web browser and brings you to the command in question in the FinSec User Guide +
`api` - Is for advanced users who wish to know more about the inner workings of the commands

** Justification: The previous implementation of `help` was sorely lacking in that it relied solely on the user
guide and thus was dependant on internet connectivity. This has been remedied with both the `brief` and `api`
types of help, which cater to offline users. +
The `guide` functionality has also been improved to bring you to the exact part of the user guide pertaining to the
requested command for added convenience.
** Highlights: The `api` form of help was designed from the ground up to be as unobtrusive as possible. It will only
generate a single html file onto your computer, and replaces it for every command thereafter to prevent excess file
cluttering.

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|The following section shows a small extract of what I have written in the FinSec user guide. This is to illustrate my
ability to write clear and concise end-user documentation by guiding users on how to use the `help` command.
|===

_{Start of extract for `help` command}_

=== Viewing help : `help`

Provides 3 different types of help for all commands in FinSec.

Keyword: `help`

Format:
`help cmd/COMMAND type/TYPE`

Refer to <<Command Summary>> for all available commands

Types include: +
`brief` (gives a brief description) +
`guide` (opens a web browser and bring you to our user guide) +
`api` (for advanced users who want to know the inner workings of the command)

Cant remember all of FinSec's commands or the command format for `help`? No worries! Even if you mistakenly
type `help` without the other parameters or get the parameters confused, a default help window such as the one below
will appear and display a command list with similar instructions to this page!

== 4. Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|The following section shows a small extract of what I have written in the FinSec developer guide. This is to
illustrate my ability in writing comprehensive technical documentation, and how I am able to provide developer insight
on the design and development of the `budget` command.
|===

_{Start of extract for `budget` command}_

=== Budget feature

The `budget` command allows for users to Generate a `**Budget**` object in FinSec. It also creates a `**Budget Graph**`
object and displays it via the User Interface.

==== Overview
The `**Budget**` feature relies primarily on the `**Claim**` and `**Income**` features, and serves as an extension to
calculate their difference.
The `**Budget**` object calculates the cash amount values of all existing `**Income**` objects and all cash amount
values of `**Claims**` that have a status of 'approved'.
It then returns the difference in values as the budget value and creates a graph detailing the statistics for the month.

==== Current Implementation
<<budgetSeqDiagram>> is a sequence of steps that illustrates the interaction between various classes when the `budget`
command is entered.
[[budgetSeqDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 2.6.2.1"]
[caption="Figure 2.6.2.1: "]
.Execution sequence of the `budget` command
image::BudgetSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

*Step 1 :* The `budget` command is passed on to the `**LogicManager**` as commandText +

*Step 2 :* The `**LogicManager::execute**` method then calls `**FinSecParser::parseCommand**` which receives the user
input (`budget`) as a parameter. +

*Step 3 :* FinSecParser then references the various command words and identifies the command to be a `budget` command
. It then calls the `**BudgetCommand**` class.

*Step 4 :* This newly created `**BudgetCommand**` object is returned to the LogicManager class, which then calls the
`**BudgetCommand::execute**` method.

*Step 5 :* The `**BudgetCommand**` then interacts with the model component of our software architecture to create a
filteredList of all `**Income**` and `**Claim**` objects using the `**model.getFilteredClaimList()**` and `**model
.getFilteredIncomeList()**` methods.

*Step 6 :* It instantiates a `**Budget**` object which contains methods such as `**calculateTotalExpenses()**` and
`**calculateBudget()**` to calculate the amount values of all the `**Claims**`, `**Incomes**` and thus use them to find
the budget amount. +
A `**BudgetGraph**` object is also created in parallel (Details expanded upon below)

*Step 7:* The `**BudgetCommand::execute**` finally completes by constructing a message string containing all these
values and returning a new `**CommandResult**` with the specific message string to its calling method which is
`**LogicManager::execute**`.

*Step 8 :* `**LogicManager::execute**` method returns a `**CommandResult**` to the calling method which is
`**MainWindow::executeCommand**`

*Step 9 :* The specific feedback is then retrieved through `**CommandResult::getFeedbackToUser**` and set in the result
display of the MainWindow. +

While creating the `**Budget**` object, a `**BudgetGraph**` object is also created in parallel. The activity diagram
below
shows how it would look like from a user's point of view.

<<budgetActDiagram>> describes the workflow of FinSec when the `budget` command is entered.
[[budgetActDiagram]]
[reftext="Figure 2.6.2.2"]
[caption="Figure 2.6.2.2: "]
.Activity diagram of the `budget` command
image::DG-BudgetActivityDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

The series of steps below demonstrates what the `**BudgetGraph**` object does in parallel to Step 6 above.

*Step 6a :* At the same time the `**Budget**` object is created, the `**BudgetGraph**` object is also instantiated,
which is
basically an XY-graph.

*Step 6b :* The `**BudgetGraph**` object creates a dataset by taking in the list of `**Claims**` and `**Incomes**` and
parsing
them to the `**ClaimPlotter**`, `**IncomePlotter**` and `**BudgetPlotter**` classes.

*Step 6c :* The 3 plotter classes then filter their respective lists to create new lists for the current month and start adding the points to the series.

The code snippet below shows the `**ClaimPlotter::plotClaims**` method +

[source, java]

   XYSeries plotClaims() {
        Double amountToAdd;
        findClaimValueAtStartOfMonth();
        claimSeries.add(1, startingExpenses);
        double currentExpenses = startingExpenses;
        List<Claim> approvedClaimsInCurrentMonthList = findApprovedClaimsInCurrentMonth();
        for (int day = 2; day <= 30; day++) {
            for (Claim claim : approvedClaimsInCurrentMonthList) {
                if (claim.getDate().date.getDayOfMonth() == day) {
                    amountToAdd = Double.parseDouble(claim.getAmount().value);
                    assert amountToAdd >= 0 : "A negative claim value managed to get into the claim list";
                    currentExpenses += amountToAdd;
                    currentExpenses = Math.round(currentExpenses * 100) / 100.0;
                }
            }
            claimSeries.add(day, currentExpenses);
        }
        return claimSeries;
    }

*Step 6d :* Once the 3 series have been returned, the plotter classes then return the completed dataset to the
`**BudgetGraph**` class which then renders the image.

*Step 6e :* The `**BudgetCommand::execute**` method then calls the `**BudgetGraph::displayBudgetGraph**` method to
display the graph image.



==== Why was it implemented this way?
With so many claims and incomes, all having differing dates, it can be hard to keep track of how much money one should have on hand at any one time.

* We felt that while knowing how much our prospective budget would be is good, knowing it over a range of time
(such as a month in the case of `**BudgetGraph**`) would help with better planning

* We also wanted to keep track of the history of said `**Claims**` and `**Incomes**` and doing it over a 1 month period
ensures there will not be too visual data cluttering the screen.

==== Design Considerations

We have considered between two differing graph designs.

.Graph Designs
[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
| Graph Design Considerations 			|	Pros and Cons
| Single Graph (Current Choice)  		|	*Pros* : Clean and clutter-free display.

                                        	 	*Cons* : It does not display as much data

| Separate Graphs based on Organisation Tags    |	*Pros* : Displays all relevant data that the user can possibly ask for

							*Cons* : Opening a multitude of graphs will visually clutter the screen with data
							unless more parsing is done to sort out which graphs are required
|=======================
We have settled on adopting a single-graph approach as having multiple graphs open can lead to the user being
overwhelmed by unnecessary data, and the code needed to achieve this result satisfactorily would be too convoluted.
