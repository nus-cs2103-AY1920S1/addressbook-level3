    "description": "This module proposes to study the role of Islam in influencing the response of the Malays to modernization and social change in general. In examining the dynamics between Islam and modernization, the module looks at both the doctrines of Islam, as well as the particular orientation of Islam that Malay society had evolved in history. The module aims not only at an understanding of how the challenge of modernization is being faced by the Malays but also seeks to understand and evaluate general theories on religion, modernization and social change through the social-historical experience of Malay society and culture.",
