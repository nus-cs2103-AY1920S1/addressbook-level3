    "description": "This course will consider the legal regime which applies to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea. The carriage of goods by sea forms an important component of a wider body of law which is called maritime (or shipping) law. The subject matter of this course also forms a part of the (private) law of international trade and will assist those students studying international sales of goods and bank payment mechanisms in international trade, and insurance and marine insurance. All these subjects are invaluable to anyone who aspires eventually to work in shipping or international trade, whether as a lawyer in a law firm, as a legal adviser in-house, in insurance in a P & I Club, or for a marine insurer. Carriage of Goods by Sea is a core area of shipping law. The principal purpose which underlines this course is the carriage of cargo from one destination to another for profit. The seller/owner of goods who wishes to export them will hire a ship (particularly in the case of bulk commodities, such as oil) or space on a ship, depending on the quantity and type of goods to be transported. This course is therefore concerned with examining the legal relationships which arise between the shipper (or owner of the goods), the carrier (the shipowner), the charterer, and the receiver/consignee of the goods. The particular emphasis will be the principal documents of carriage, such as bills of lading, sea waybills and ship\u2019s delivery orders, and the domestic legislation which governs these documents and also gives effect to international conventions. The coverage of international conventions will include the Rotterdam Rules, even though these Rules are not yet in force. A study will also be made of charterparties, specifically, voyage charters and time charters.",
