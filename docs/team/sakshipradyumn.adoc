== Portfolio Overview

This project portfolio page documents my contribution to the team project __TravelPal__. The page includes an overview
of the project, summary of the features I have implemented, and contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide.

== About our Project
The application _TravelPal_ developed by our team is an all-in-one *Trip Planner* which provides casual travellers and
leisure travellers a hassle free way to manage their trips before, during and after the trip!
It comes with a highly customisable, intuitive and integrated trip management system. We aim to ease pre-trip planning
process with features such as _trip itinerary_, _trip inventory_, _bookings manager_, and _expense manager_, and offer
a platform for users to record their memorable trip highlights with our _diary_ feature.

_TravelPal_ has the feature of Command Line Interface (CLI) for keyboard input as it is a PC-based application.
Furthermore, each CLI feature has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) alternative for richer user friendly experience.

In GUI, display includes panes, menus and message boxes. We believe such implementation makes our application more
user-friendly and easy to use.

In our project, my role was to implement the _Booking Manager_ feature. The following sections will elaborate on the
enhancements related to Booking.

== Summary of contributions

This section encompasses an overview of my contribution to the TravelPal application, including the summary of my code
implementation and how they add value to the application in terms of functionality and user experience.

==== *Major enhancements*: Implementation of the _Booking Manager_ feature

** *What it does*: The _Booking Manager_ allows users to manage all sorts of bookings, by mentioning the type in the
name description. User can choose to manually add a new booking. All bookings will be displayed in a sequential order
** *Justification*: Keeping track of a booking can be a hassle as some are pre-planned while some are scheduled
on-the-go. _Booking Manager_ intends to mitigate user's troubles by providing a convenient way to keep a track of all
the bookings. User can also note the expenditure associated with the booking apart from storing the contact details
(mobile number, address, description, etc.)
** *Highlights*: Managing the bookings is tricky in the sense that seemingly same looking booking might result in
confusion, so the `create` feature will warn the user if same booking is being created, apart from convenient listing of
all the bookings in a bug-free and efficient way.
** *Credits*: I used the concepts and logic from the existing code of address book provided to us to enhance the
features.

* Idea generation:
** Contributed main idea of _TravelPal_ and its various sub-features (itinerary, bookings, contacts, etc.), along with
their working diagrams during project discussion, partly inspired from my tribulations as well.
(see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKmIZghbtYwgSWdDTiRQDLdXjKNhjuys8uSO8Y6McyI/edit[travelpal idea generation google docs])
** Kept a timeline of the features added to coordinate in a better fashion among the team members.

* Enhancements to existing features:
** Wrote test cases for _Booking Manager_ and related classes.
** Helped in testing of all the features, in general.
** Updated UI, and logic of the code to make it user friendly as well as efficient.

* Project management:
** Reviewed and approved several PRs of my team members
** Updated AboutUs page https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/pull/18[#18]

== Achievements and Learnings

Development of __TravelPal__ is one of my first brown-field software engineering projects. During the process, I have
gained many insights, project work ethics and presentational skills apart from useful programming knowledge. I also
learned how to work on a large code base while working on my feature.

Knowledge was gained not by the mere end-product but during the collaborated team journey and educational experience.
