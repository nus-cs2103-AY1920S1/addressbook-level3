    "description": "The module provides a foundation for students interested in doing research into nanomaterials. It starts by explaining to students how as a material\u2019s dimensions enters the nanoscale its mechanical, electronic, magnetic and optical properties are altered in manner that results in unique behaviours that are vastly different from their bulk counterparts. The module will finish with aspects of current research on nanomaterials.",
