    "description": "The Capstone project for the Master of Technology in Software Engineering is designed to allow students to experience engineering smart, secure and scalable software systems, platforms and products. The project allows students to apply their knowledge in a real world context, demonstrating their mastery of a range of software skills, such as in project management, requirements analysis, architecture and design, software construction, verification and validation. It also allows students to apply techniques and skills learnt to build smart systems and platforms that are capable of handling and making use of AI techniques, Internet of Things and Big Data. The capstone project will be conducted typically in teams of 3-5 students. However in special cases, students maybe allowed do individual projects. Students are expected to spend at least 40 man-days of effort each.",
