    "description": "This module provides an overview of film theories as they have been developed from the early days of cinema up to the present. The module aims to enable students to understand key theoretical concepts and approaches, as well as to give students a clear sense of how certain theoretical perspectives are compared to others. Students will also be able to consider how film theories have been elaborated in dialogue with critical theory paradigms such as phenomenology, existentialism, psychoanalysis, semiotics, feminism, postcolonialism, poststructuralism, and postmodernism.",
