    "description": "This Independent Study Module is specially designed for the Semester-in-SEA programme at the SEASP in order to enable the student to explore an approved topic in Southeast Asian Studies. We seek to develop three skills that could only be most fruitfully realised in a fieldwork context away from the campus environment. These are namely: the ability to conduct fieldwork; utilising a Southeast Asian language for academic study; and first-hand engagement with research methodological issues. Beyond the ability of writing a logical essay learnt in campus, the student will develop in-depth academic research capabilities.",
