    "description": "In this course, we will investigate a fundamental human question: what is happiness, and what do we need to attain it? Is happiness in our own control or does it depend on external circumstances, such as wealth or freedom? Are pleasure or virtue necessary or even sufficient conditions of happiness? What constitutes a meaningful life, and how is meaning related to happiness? To reflect on such questions, we will investigate the arguments of philosophers, psychologists, economists, and other thinkers over the course of three thematic units.",
