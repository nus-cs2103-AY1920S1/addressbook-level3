    "description": "This seminar meditates on the relationship between women and writing: not just the reduced visibility of women writers, nor the mis-representation of women in writing, but the question of what it means, what is it, to write?, alongside how one is supposed to write. And if the mind and body are intertwined, this suggests that writing is a technology that potentially brings forth one\u2019s body. Thus, this seminar opens the possibility that writing is an imaginative challenge to normativity, to authority, to the power of origins: of the potentiality of writing as a cry, perhaps even an ethical scream.",
