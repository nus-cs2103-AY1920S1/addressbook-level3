    "description": "This module will challenge advanced students to connect the three main threads of the PPE major: politics, philosophy, and economics. To do so, we will analyse the historical development and the legitimacy of the Welfare State, which rose to predominance in the twentieth century. To understand its future, we will examine the myriad of challenges facing it today, including economic crises and interstate organizations. We will also consider how questions arising from the Welfare State bear on other values, especially democracy and the rule of law.",
