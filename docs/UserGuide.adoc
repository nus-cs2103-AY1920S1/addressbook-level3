== Introduction

The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS) is a desktop app that aims to combine Command Line Interface (CLI) style commands with a dual-pane GUI for easy navigation of module appeals, module information, and student particulars. This app is particularly aimed towards *module appeal administrators who prefer to work through their heavy backload of module appeals without ever having to leave the comfort of the keyboard for their mouse*. The MAMS system can quickly bring up entire lists of students, appeals, and modules for side-by-side comparison, with specific display commands to view the expanded details of any particular object in question. Once reviewing of the information is complete, the MAMS system also provides a suite of commands for resolving appeals, overriding MC limits, and leaving special notes on students.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `MAMS.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS).
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

Broadly speaking, the MAMS handles three main types of items: *Students, Appeals, and Modules*. Each of these items may be further grouped into sub-lists.
eg. Students may be organized by matriculation year, course of study etc.

A student is uniquely identified by his/her 9-character Matriculation Number starting and ending with a letter, eg. `A0132243W`

An appeal request is uniquely identified by a prefix `C`, followed by a 6-digit Case ID, eg. `C123456`

A module is uniquely identified by a COURSE_PREFIX (eg. `CS` for Computer Science) and a 4 to 6 character sequence. eg. `CS2103` and `CS2103T`.

====
*Command Format*

* Each command must begin with a command word. See each command below for the list of associated command words.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user eg. `DESCRIPTION_OF_TASK` denotes that you should provide a short description of the task.
* Items enclosed by square brackets are optional parameters that can be passed in eg. `view OBJECT_ID [l/]` can be used as `view A0122432Z l/` or `view 230293`.
* Any item that is followed by an ellipsis (`...`) can be used multiple times including zero eg. `[f/FILTER]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `f/CS` , `f/CS f/YEAR4` etc.
* Parameters within square brackets can be supplied in any order.
====

=== Viewing single objects: `view`

This command brings up an object with fully expanded details on a single pane. If no pane is specified within the tags, the object defaults to showing up on the right pane.

Format: `view OBJECT_ID [l/] [r/]`

Tags:
`[l/]` displays the object on the left pane
`[r/]` displays the object on the right pane

Examples:

* `view A0122432Z l/`

Sample output: Fully expanded administrative details of the student with matriculation ID A0122432Z on the left pane.

* `view 230293`

Sample output: Fully expanded administrative details of the appeal with case ID 230293 on the right pane.

* `view CS2103 r/`

Sample output: Fully expanded administrative details of the CS2103 module on the right pane.

=== Listing objects by specified lists: `list`

Format: list OBJECT_TYPE `[f/FILTER]... [r/] [l/]`

Tags:
`[f/FILTER]` specifies the filters that are applied on the results of the list command. Each FILTER is delimited by commas following the `f/` tag, with no spaces. When this tag is not present, the program defaults to displaying the full list. As with the `view` command, if both `/r` and `/l` tags are not present, the program defaults to displaying the lists on the right pane.

Examples:

* `list`

Sample Output: Shows a list of all appeals by default on the right pane

* `list module f/CS`

Sample Output: Shows a list of modules filtered by the CS (Computer Science) tag, on the right pane

* `list students f/YEAR4,CS l/`

Sample Output: Shows a list of students filtered by the Year4 and CS tags, displayed on the left pane.

=== Show clashes: `clash`

==== Show clashes between 2 modules
This command checks to see if the lecture slots of 2 modules clashes, and displays the result to the user

Format: `clash MODULE_CODE MODULE_CODE`

Examples:

* `clash cs1010 cs1020`

Sample output:

`Clash detected between CS1010 and CS1020: +
Time slot: 1400-1500 +
Event for CS1010: Lecture 1300-1500 +
Event for CS1020: Lecture 1400-1600`

* `clash ge1001 ge1002`

Sample output: `No clash detected for ge1001 and ge1002`


==== Show clashes in student timetable

Shows if there are clashes in a student’s (preallocated) timetable.

Format: `clash STUDENT_ID`

Examples:

* `clash A01234567H`

Sample output:

`Modules taken by student A01234567H: +
cs1010, cs1020, cs1040, cs1050,cs1060 +
Clash detected between CS1010 and CS1020: +
Time slot: 1400-1500 +
Event for CS1010: Lecture 1300-1500 +
Event for CS1020: Lecture 1400-1600`

* `clash A01234567B`

Sample output:

`Modules student A01234567H are taking: +
Ge1020,ge1111,ge1030,ge1303 +
No clash detected.`

==== Show clashes in an appeal

Shows if the module a student is requesting for clashes with his/her current existing modules.

Format: `clash APPEAL_NUMBER`

Examples:

* `clash #301935`

Sample output:

`Modules taken by student A01234567H: +
cs1010, cs1040, cs1050,cs1060 +

=== Add or remove modules `addmod` & `removemod`

==== Add a module to a student
This command adds a module to specific student. If there is a clash detected
between existing modules and the module being added, additional confirmation will be required.
