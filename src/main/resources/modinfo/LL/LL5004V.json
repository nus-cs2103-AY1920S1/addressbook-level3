    "description": "This course provides an insight into international civil aviation and the legal and regulatory issues facing airlines, governments and the common passenger. Issues raised include public air law and policy, aviation security in light of recent global developments and private air law. Emphasis will be placed on issues relevant to Singapore and Asia, given Singapore's status as a major aviation hub and the exponential growth of the industry in the Asia-Pacific. Topics to be discussed include the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, bilateral services agreements, aircraft safety, terrorism and aviation security and carrier liability for death or injury to passengers. Competition among airlines will also be analysed, including business strategies such as code-sharing, frequent flier schemes and alliances. The severe competitive environment introduced by weakening economies, war and terrorism will also be discussed. This course will be relevant for individuals with a keen interest in air travel, and is designed for those interested in joining the aviation industry or large law firms with an aviation practice.",
