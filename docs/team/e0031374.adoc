== PROJECT: Tagline

'''

== Purpose of Personal Project Portfolio
This portfolio is to document my contributions made towards the project done in CS2103T.
It highlights several of my code contributions as well as documentation additions to show the
main feature I have been working on as part of the project.

== About the project: Tagline
Tasked with enhancing the capabilities of a basic command line interface desktop addressbook
application, my team of five chose to extend the functionality to include note-taking
capabilities. Combining the existing contact infrastructure with tags and note support,
we aim to make a more people-centric note taking platform we call Tagline.
This application aims to help students more easily organize and find their notes based on
the people the notes are connected to.

This is what our project looks like

My role for this project is to implement the `Group`  feature to allow for organizing `Contact`s together into `Groups` which can be used to manage notes as a whole. The following sections together with documentation added to the user and developer guides depict this enhancement in greater detail.

== Summary of contributions
In this project, I my main feature was to develop a way to organize contact together into
Groups. This allows users to organize contacts in a more natural way based on social circles
of relationships rather than as an alphatically ordered list.
It would also lay the groundwork for other features such as group tagging of notes.

* *Major enhancement*: I added a range of features providing the *ability to group contacts together* for better organization
** What it does: with `group create` a group of contacts can be created, contacts can be added or removed using `group add` and `group remove` commands. Groups can be searched for and displayed using `group list` and `group find`.
** Justification: social circles exist in more than just a one to one relationship and can belong in a group with a shared feature be it an orientation group of friends who all know each other or a project group with common purpose. Having the capability to quickly reference other contacts in the same group would make the user experience much better compared to scrolling through an alphabetically ordered list in an addressbook.
** Highlights: this enhancements supplements the existing structure of the addressbook.

* *Code contributed*: The following links highlight samples of my code [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/tagline/logic/parser/group/GroupCommandParser.java[Functional code]] [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-3/main/blob/master/src/test/java/tagline/model/group/GroupManagerTest.java[Test code]] _

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
*** Updated the developer guide to better reflect `Model` and `Storage` components after they have been changed to accommodate other features: https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f12-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-NoteModel[NoteModel], https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f12-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-Storage[StorageComponent]
** Community:
*** Contributed to forum discussions to clarify potential tripups (examples:  https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/131[131]
*** Reviewed and offered suggestions for other teams in class  (examples:  https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/pull/62[SecureIT#22]

== Contributions to the User Guide
The following sample highlights some of my additions to Tagline User Guide.
This is primarily for `group` features I had developed.

|===
|_The following excerpt for `group add` is chosen to represent other group command
which are written in a similar style but ommitted due repetition. The sample aims to
demonstrate my approach to writing documentation to help
end users better understand the features of the product._

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
The following sample highlights some of my additions to Tagline Developer Guide.
This is primarily for `group` features I had developed.

|_The following excerpt demonstrate my approach to writing documentation to showcase
how I write technical documentation to explain how my developed feature functions
to aid future developers better understand how the feature functions and the
design choices considered and made._
