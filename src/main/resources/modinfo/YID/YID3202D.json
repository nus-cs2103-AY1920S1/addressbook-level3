    "description": "This course is an interdisciplinary examination of climate change and policy challenges around developing energy systems for a sustainable future. We will analyse existing frameworks of treaties, laws, regulations, and policies -- and the incentivisation of greenhouse gas build-up. What would 21st century frameworks designed to deliver a sustainable energy future and successful responses to climate change look like? Does the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement provide the right foundation for action? How should equity be addressed? How are incentives structured to engage businesses in climate change problem solving and to spur innovation? Students will engage in a consecutive four-day case competition during recess week.",
