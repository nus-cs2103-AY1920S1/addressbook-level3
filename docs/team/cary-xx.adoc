== PROJECT: MYMorise

---

== Overview

MYMorise — Manage Your Money(MYM) is a desktop application for those who prefer tracking personal expenses on their
computers. With MYMorise, you can easily see your daily expenses as well as a summary, along with other useful functionalities.
More importantly, MYMorise is optimized for those who prefer to work with Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20
kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to autocomplete*
** What it does: Similar to the autocomplete feature in modern IDE, user can press key or click on a selected item to
autocomplete
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can type faster and no longer need
to type exactly the same command word. Autocomplete will do this for you.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
analysis of Javafx component as well as searching logic. The implementation too was challenging because several parts
need to be combined together and some checks and fixes are also required towards a bug-free autocomplete feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using F3/F4 keys
and display history command list.
** What it does: The history command helps user to trace the commands he/she entered since he/she starts the app.
Navigation of history using key is also supported.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can track his/her input history and
navigate to any history command without the need to type again if he/she wants to execute previous command.

* *Minor enhancement*: rearrange GUI layout and draw piechart for displaying statistics.

== Introduction

*MYMorise -- Manage Your Money(MYM)* is a desktop application for those who *prefer tracking personal expenses on their
computers*. With MYMorise, you can easily see your daily expenses as well as a summary, along with other useful
functionalities. More importantly, MYMorise is *optimized for those who prefer to work with Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface
(GUI)*. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

****
*Things to note in MYMorise:*

* Expense - refers to the cost incurred in or required for something which the user would like to record
* Budget - refers to an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.
* Default expense list - refers to all expenses that do not fall into any budgets in MYMorise.
* The amounts used in MYMorise can only work for numbers up to 2 decimal places.
* MYMorise's GUI consists of 3 display panels:

    The left panel - displays all expenses recorded in MYMorise. User commands do not reference from this panel and should not be made based on this panel. Commands made should reference from the centre panel. The purpose of this panel is solely for displaying all expenses recorded only.

    The centre panel - displays the current view requested by user. All commands made are in relative to the content displayed in this panel. That is, if a user enters the command `listBudgets` or `view 1`, this panel will reflect the content requested. Subsequent commands such as `editExpense` and `editBudget` will reference from this panel. On start up, the centre panel displays the default expense list.

    The right panel - displays the visual graphics of the content shown in the centre panel only.
****

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `MYMorise.jar`.
.  Copy the jar file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for MYMorise.
.  Run `java -jar path_to_folder/MYMorise.jar` in your CLI. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

=== Autocomplete
Equip with IDE-like autocomplete function for faster input and
enables users to quickly fill in command arguments with
autocomplete suggestions.

Suggestions include commonly used words in MYMorise and users may customize the suggestion list by changing the
`vocabulary.txt`

When the user types, if there are suggestions for a certain input, user can press kbd:[tab] to autofill the first
suggestion or press kbd:[DOWN] and kbd:[UP] to navigate between suggestions and then press kbd:[tab] or kbd:[enter]
to autofill the selected item. User may also just kbd:[click] on an item to autofill.

=== Retrieve the history of the commands executed: `history`
Returns the list of history commands executed.
[TIP]
Press kbd:[F3] to navigate to previous input; Press kbd:[F4] to navigate to next input;
[NOTE]
Use keyboard to navigate through the history will only take effect when the focus is in `TextField`.
[NOTE]
kbd:[UP] and kbd:[DOWN] cannot be used here to navigate through the history since they are used to navigate through
the autocomplete suggestions.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`
Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

// tag::saving[]
=== Saving data
Expense and Budget data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.
// end::saving[]

=== Locating expenses by name: `find` `[coming in v2.0]`
Finds all expenses by name, date, tag. +
Format: `find [n/NAME] [d/DATE] [t/TAG]`

****
* Search by name and tag is case insensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
* Search by date must use the date format `dd/MM/yyyy`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the fields provided are searched.
* Only whole words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
****

Examples:

* `find n/Coffee` +
Returns `coffee` and `Starbucks Coffee`.
* `find n/Cheesecake` +
Returns any expense having names `Cheesecake`, eg: `Strawberry Cheesecake`, `Blueberry Cheesecake`.

=== AutoComplete Feature
==== Implementation
Autocomplete is facilitated by several parts.
The logic part is implemented through `java.seedu.address.logic.search` package which contains `AutoComplete` and
`BinarySearch`.

The model is constructed through `java.seedu.address.model.autocomplete` which contains `AutoCompleteModel` and `Word`.

The Ui part is implemented through `java.seedu.address.ui.QueryCard` on top of `CommandBox`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step. (p.s. details are
omitted)

Step 1. The user launches MYMorise and the user will be prompted to enter a command as shown in the command box.

Step 2. User enter `a` and the listener is triggered. Then `AutoComplete#initAc()` and
`AutoComplete#getSuggestions()` is invoked.

Step 3. `initAc()` calls `AutoComplete#readWordsFromFile()` which reads the vocabulary from our local dictionary to get
the database and then construct an `AutocompleteModel` with the vocabulary read.

Step 4. `getSuggestions(input)` calls `AutocompleteModel#allMatches()` which utilises the improved version of binary
search algorithm `BinarySearch`. The algorithm will return the first and last index of potential matched results.
Since the result is based on a pre-order for sorting, all the words inside this range will be the qualified ones.

Step 5. The listview of `QueryCard` will be updated based on the words and weights given and attached to the
`TextField`.

The following sequence diagram shows how autocomplete operation works:

image::AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enter something new.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Autocomplete works
In terms of the retrieving suggestion list, an enhanced binary search algorithm is used. Since a word (which
represents a autocomplete term) has a name and weight, the default "vocabulary" will be first sort based on weight
and for same weight, sort alphanumerically.

In terms of replacing the target term to the `TextField`, 2 approaches are proposed

* **Approach 1 (current choice)**: 2 listeners were added. 1) 1st listener for `TextFormatter`, this is especially
utilised
to retrieving the updated cursor position, which is where it outperforms. 2) 2nd listener for
`TextInputControl`
to detect the text change of `TextField`. Then combined with previously returned caret position, we can replace the
corresponding position with target term (the one user selected)

* **Approach 2**. 1 listener for `caretProperty` is added to detect the change of position of caret (i.e., cursor).
This approach is simpler with regard to logic but more complicated during implementation. Since caret position change
does not necessarily mean textField change, therefore extra check would be required, also resulting in
potential inaccuracy.

In terms of user interaction, different listeners are added for different valid actions (e.g. press TAB, ENTER and
navigate using UP and DOWN) to make user benefit by typing faster.

=== History Feature
==== Implementation
History is mainly facilitated by `CommandHistory` with `HistoryPointer`. When the app starts, a `CommandHistory`
instance is created and any command executed (no matter valid or not) will be saved to a list of history commands.
And when the user calls the `history`, the overall history list will display on the `resultDisplayPanel`. And when
user press *F3* and *F4* to navigate through the history list, the `HistoryPointer` will point to corresponding
history.

Similar to Section 3.1, the history displayed on `textField` is facilitated by `KeyEventListener`. When the keyinput
event of *F3* or *F4* is triggered, it will navigate to previous input and next input correspondingly.

The following class diagram illustrates the interaction between `historyCommand` and other parts:
