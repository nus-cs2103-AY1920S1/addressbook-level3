    "description": "The sociology of law studies law as a social institution. We will explore the relationships among law, social actors and other social institutions. This is in contrast to the legal academy's formalist approaches that treat law as autonomous and impartial, and jurisprudential concerns about law's morality. We will consider both theoretical and empirical, and classic and contemporary works in sociology of law. Issues covered include: law and classic social theory; law and contemporary social theory; law and power; the social construction of disputes and dispute resolution; law and organizations; legal mobilization; law, collective action, and social change; legal consciousness; and, sociological perspectives on the legal profession.",
