    "description": "This module deals with the four key performance mandates that are responsible for ensuring good IEQ. The thermal performance deals with thermal comfort in all\ntypes of buildings and climates including adaptive comfort models. The indoor air quality (IAQ) performance examines the relationship between IAQ and occupants\u2019\nwell-being and health and identifies the types and sources of indoor air pollutants and means of minimizing the problems. The experimental procedures of  investigating and analysing thermal and IAQ issues are also introduced. The lighting performance deals with visual perception, color classifications and lighting installation design with specific reference to integration and control of artificial and day lighting, choice of light sources and lighting systems.\nThe acoustic performance deals with community noise\nrating systems and the propagation of sound in the urban\nenvironment. Environmental noise monitoring and\nmodelling, sound transmission and acoustical design of\nrooms will be discussed. Laboratory and field\nmeasurements using acoustical instruments will be used to\nstrengthen students\u2019 understanding and analytical and\npresentation skills on the subject.",
