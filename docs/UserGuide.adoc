== Introduction

Modulo is a desktop application helping National University of Singapore (NUS) students to audit their academics, finances and schedule their time as they try their best to survive yet another semester of college. Those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) might find using Modulo to be more straightforward than the usual Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. The application has the visual benefits of a GUI but stands strongly rooted in command line usage. Modulo does not require an internet connection to run so there’s no worry when the school wifi goes MIA yet again. The only time you need to be connected is at the start, when downloading the application. Look to <<Quick Start>> to find out how to get started on Modulo!

== Quick Start

.  Make sure that `Java 11` or above is installed in your computer. Otherwise, you can download Java 11 https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[here].
* Enter the follow command in Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal on Mac to check your current version of Java: `java --version`
.  Download the latest `modulo.jar` here.
.  Copy the `.jar` file to a folder you wish to set as your working directory for the application.
.  Double-click the file to start Modulo. If the GUI does not appear in a few seconds, please try running `java -jar modulo.jar` in your command prompt or terminal.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will show a list of commands which _Modulo_ supports.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `add CS2100 Assignment 1 t\21 August 2019 #High-Priority` : adds a task with description `CS2100 Assignment 1` to the _Modulo_.
* `add CS2103 1920S1`: adds module `CS2103` to academic year and semester `1920S1`
* `add [qns] _What can one catch that is not thrown?_ [type] _normal_ [ans] _A cold_ [cat] CS2131`: adds a new quiz question to category `CS2131`
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
