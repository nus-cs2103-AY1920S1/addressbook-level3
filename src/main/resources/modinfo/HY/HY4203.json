    "description": "China's perceptions of the maritime frontier during imperial times are often seen as passive and monotonous. The imperial governments are said to have imposed restrictions and prohibitions to prevent their own people from going out to sea and outsiders from coming at will to visit the China coast. The apparent inertia in China's long maritime history is deceptive. For more than two thousand years, the imperial governments had in fact been responding to coastal conditions in rational and pragmatic ways. The module examines the maritime tradition of China with the emphasis on the period from the 12th to the early 20th centuries. It covers the following five sections: 1) Early contacts with the maritime world from Han to Song (3rd century B.C. to 12th century A.D.): a long view; 2) Song, Yuan and early Ming periods (12th - 15th centuries) venturing out; 3) From the mid Ming to the high Qing (16th - 18th centuries): Core periphery relations; 4) From tribute relations to the treaty system in perspective; 5) Culture, mobility and entrepreneurship of Chinese merchants. The maritime China will be viewed, not in isolation, but from a broad national and international perspective. Aspects will be discussed in themes and historiographical issues will be examined. An emphasis is put on reading, thinking and discussion.",
