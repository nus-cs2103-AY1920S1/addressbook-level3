    "description": "The SRP is a talent development programme. It is meant for very capable students who aspire to a higher level of challenge than that offered through the mere application of scientific and mathematical concepts in the classroom. Highly motivated students are involved in concentrated research and are mentored by practising mathematicians, scientists, medical researchers and engineers from the Faculties of Science, Medicine and Engineering of the National University of Singapore (NUS) and participating Research Centres/Institutes such as the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Tropical Marine Science Institute, the Defence Science & Technology Agency, and the Singapore Botanic Gardens.",
