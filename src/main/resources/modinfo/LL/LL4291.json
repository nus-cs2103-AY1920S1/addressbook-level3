    "description": "The class will survey approaches to understanding legal pluralism in a range of settings, focusing on the various ways in which autonomous normative orders, including systems of law, interact with one another. Topics include: how 'outsider' groups (e.g., Mayan Indians in Mexico, Roma-Gypsy communities, merchant guilds) govern themselves while resisting submission to the state law; the tensions between custom, state law, and human rights in Asia after the colonialist period; and the ways in which the pluralist structure of international treaty law and organization are transforming law and courts at the national level.",
