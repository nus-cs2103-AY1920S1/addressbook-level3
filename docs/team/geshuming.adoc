== PROJECT: ModuleBook

== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document the contributions I have made to the ModuleBook project.

The ModuleBook project is developed by a team of 4 software engineering students as a requirement for the CS2103T module taught at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

ModuleBook is a module tracking and planning application for students of NUS. It allows students to view and track modules, as well as add deadlines and other useful information such as hyperlinks.

== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*: added *archived modules*

* *What it is*: Archived modules contain module data from NUSMods, such as the module code, title, description, prerequisites, preclusions and semester data (exam dates and whether the module is offered for the semester).

* *Justification*: This feature allows developers to use existing data from NUSMods to perform operations, such as filtering (find command). This feature also allows users to view data from NUSMods.

* *Code*: Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/27[#27], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/28[#28] and https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/44[#44]

*Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view modules*

* *What it does*: Allows users to view an archived module to get more details. Also allows users to view a tracked module to access and modify deadlines and hyperlinks.

* *Justification*: This feature enhances the user experience by only displaying details from a single module at any one time. It also minimizes details to be displayed on the module list.

* *Highlights*: This feature creates a context for users to perform commands pertaining to a module. For example, a user can specify that they want to add a hyperlink to the module they are viewing without specifying the module in the command.

* *Credits*: The view feature is a result of the observation of many popular applications on the market, such as Telegram, Discord, Outlook.

* *Code*: Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/46[#46] and https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/72[#72]

*Minor enhancement*: Refactor module list to display archived modules and tracked modules together, with tracked modules overriding the referenced archived modules. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/142[#142])

*Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=geshuming&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=geshuming&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Link to RepoSense] for functional and test code
