    "description": "We will examine water\u2019s importance to economic development and its special interest to lawyers. Water governance concerns both private as well as public interests. Meanwhile, there is fundamental variation in how much is available and where. And because water flows, society must manage it across political boundaries. By drawing on the examples of a few key river basins, we will examine the reasons and processes by which water law has evolved as it has \u2013 and whether and how, given rising pressures and uncertainty, it may change.",
