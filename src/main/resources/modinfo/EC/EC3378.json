    "description": "India is one of Asia\u2019s most important economies and amongst the largest in the world. However, India\u2019s, and South Asia\u2019s trade/investment integration with the rest of Asia remains limited. With business\u2010friendly government firmly in power in India, the module will focus on applied aspects of the macroeconomic fundamentals, and growth strategies in India and South Asian economies, and their cross\u2010border thematic issues with policy relevance (e.g. demographic dividend, overcoming poverty, income inequality, knowledge economy, R&D/innovation, environmental challenges, governance issues, etc). The module will also deal with the ongoing and planned intra\u2010regional, and interregional cooperation measures (eg. SAARC, SAFTA, SASEC, ASEAN, RCEP, GMS, BRICS\u2019 NDB, etc).",
