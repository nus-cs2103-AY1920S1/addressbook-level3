== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section will illustrate and detail the overall design of the software for treasurerPro.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This section illustrates the overall architecture of the software for treasurerPro.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of treasurerPro.

[TIP]
The `.xml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
You may use link:draw.io[draw.io] to edit the diagrams.

treasurerPro is divided primarily into 6 packages which contain implementation for each tab in the UI:

. transaction package: Home Tab
. person package: Members Tab
. reimbursement package: Reimbursements Tab
. inventory package: Inventory Tab
. cashier package: Cashier Tab
. overview package: Overview Tab

Each package uses either TXT or JSON based storage. Within the package, they share a similar structure,
consisting of the following components:

. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the package.
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands sent to that package.
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the package in-memory.
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The details on the structure of these components are located in the next few sections.
Alternatively, clicking on the names in the above list will bring you to the respective section.

Apart from the components above, treasurerPro also has the following shared components:

. `Main`
. `Commons`

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes each package in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down each package and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `Log Center` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

Commands in treasurerPro are tab-specific.
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1` in the Transactions tab.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command within Transactions tab.
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

A command input by the user is received by `MainWindow`, and based upon which tab the user is currently on, forwarded to
the respective `Logic`. Further details of the interactions between `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` are given below.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI component consists of a `MainWindow` that holds both a `TabPane` and a `Lion`.
The `TabPane` holds multiple `Tab` objects, for example, `Transactions` and `Cashier`.
The `Lion` consists of a `ScrollPane` that holds messages displayed to the user.

All these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the respective package's `Logic` component.
* Updates itself with modified data whenever changes are made by the user.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section will show the structures of the `Logic` Component of the different tabs.
The diagram below shows a generalised view of the `Logic` component within the packages.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Generalised `Logic` Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

An outline of how a command is processed through `Logic` is as follows:

. `Logic` uses the tab's `Parser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person, transaction).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui` (not depicted).

[[GeneralLogicSD]]
A general sequence diagram depicting the above outline is shown below:

.Sequence Diagram for execution within `Logic`.
image::GeneralSequenceDiagram.png[]

Further details on the implementation of the `Parser` and `Command` can be found below in <<RTLogic, Section 2.3.1. Home and Reimbursement Tab>>,
<<ICLogic, Section 2.3.2. Inventory and Cashier Tab>> and <<PLogic, Section 2.3.3. Members Tab>> below.

==== Details on `Logic` Implementation for Members Tab
[[PLogic]]
This section will show further details of the `Logic` Component of the Members Tab.
This is integrated from the existing `AddressBook`.
Given below is a Class Diagram showing the structure of `Parser` within the `Logic` Component:

.Structure of `Parser` for Members Tab.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
This section will show the structures of the `Model` Component of the different tabs.
The diagram below shows a generalised view of the `Model` component within the packages.

.Structure of the Generalised `Model` Component
image::ModelCD.png[]

[NOTE]
`XYZObjects` are only present in the `transaction`, `reimbursement`, `person`, `cashier` and `inventory` packages.


==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for Home Tab
* stores a `TransactionList` object that represents the list of all transactions data
* stores a `Predicate<Transaction>` object to filter the list of all transactions
* stores another `TransactionList` object that represents the filtered list of transactions according to the predicate

*API for transaction package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/transaction/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for Reimbursements Tab
To be filled in :)

*API for reimbursements package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/reimbursement/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for Members Tab
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences for `person` package.
* stores the Address Book data for `person` package.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

*API for person package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/person/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for Inventory Tab
To be filled in :)

*API for inventory package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/inventory/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for Cashier Tab
* stores a `InventoryList` object that represents the list of all inventory data
* stores a list of sales items present on the table of the Inventory Tab
* accesses the `TransactionList` object from Transaction package that represents the list of all transactions data

[NOTE]
This `Inventory List` is different from the one in the `Model` of Inventory package. This is so that the `Inventory List` in
the `Model` of cashier package cannot add or delete any items in the inventory. This means that `Inventory List` in cashier
package access different set of methods which modifies only the quantity of the item.

*API for cashier package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/cashier/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for Overview Tab
To be filled in :)

*API for overview package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/overview/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

//[NOTE]
//As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference.
//This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.
//An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +

//image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
This section will show the structures of the `Storage` Component of the different tabs.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented and works.
There are a total of 6 tabs in our application for each feature: Home Tab, Members Tab, Reimbursement Tab,
Inventory Tab, Cashier Tab, Overview Tab.

=== Home Tab
This tab will help to show records of individual transactions from miscellaneous spending, revenue from sales and
cost of buying items to sell. Each transaction will require an input of its date, description, category, amount
and member that is accountable for it.

Revenue from each cashier checkout will also be automatically inputted as
a transaction with positive amount in this tab with the person being the cashier. The inputted transactions that corresponds to
a spending with a negative amount will be tabulated for each member in the reimbursement tab to keep track of reimbursements.

==== Add Command feature
This feature requires access to the `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in. All fields in the transactions are compulsory
to be inputted by the user: date, description, category, amount, person full name. The person's name inputted
has to match a name already existing in the `AddressBook` which is shown in our Members Tab.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `AddCommand` works and is the reference from <<GeneralLogicSD, Interactions Inside the Logic Component for a Command>>:

.Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeAddCommandSD.png[]

In addition, the `resetPredicate()` method from `ModelManager` is called in the `AddCommand`. Thus, the UI table will immediately shows the full
transaction list regardless of the list shown at the start of the activity diagram. If the prior command was a Find Command,
then the list in the beginning of the activity diagram would be a filtered list but after the add command is executed,
the full list of transactions would be shown.

After the command is executed, the `LogicManager` updates the in-app list of transactions via the `ModelManager` and updates
the data file via the `StorageManager`. The following sequence diagram shows how the updating of the list of transactions in the app and
in the data file:
[[UpdateTL]]
.Sequence Diagram of updating the transaction list in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeAddCommandMMSM.png[]

[NOTE]
This update of the list of transactions is done for every command that is executed successfully in the Home Tab.

Finally, the `StorageManager` and `ModelManager` inside the Reimbursement package will be updated with the latest list of transactions
to generate an updated list of reimbursements for the user to view in the Reimbursement Tab. The following sequence diagram shows how
the Reimbursement Tab is updated from the `MainWindow`:
[[update-reimbursement]]
.Sequence Diagram of updating the reimbursement list in Reimbursement Tab (transaction package)

image::TUpdateRinMainWindow.png[]

[NOTE]
This update of the Reimbursement Tab is done for every command after the list of transactions is updated (shown in <<UpdateTL, Sequence Diagram of updating the transaction list in Home Tab>>) when there is a command executed successfully in the Home Tab.

To better illustrate the flow of events from the moment a user inputs a command till the completion of the command,
the activity diagram for the Add Command is shown below:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabActivityDiagramAddCommand.png[]

As shown, when a user does not input all the compulsory fields or input a name that does not match anyone in
the `AddressBook`, a response to inform the user of the incorrect input is shown and when a successful addition is
done, a response message is shown as well by our mascot, Leo.

Since the reimbursement tab tabulates the amount to be reimbursed to a person, if the inputted amount is a negative
amount to indicate a spending that needs to be reimbursed, the reimbursement tab will update and show this record.

==== Delete Command Feature
This feature allows for 2 types of deletion, by
the index shown in the table or by the person's name. Inputting the person's name will cause all transactions linked to
that person to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete by name command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Delete Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeDeleteNameCommand.png[]

In addition, the `resetPredicate()` method in `ModelManager` is not called in the `DeleteNameCommand`. Thus, the UI table will continue to show the
filtered transaction list. If the prior input is a Find Command and the list at the start of the activity diagram shows
a filtered list by the Find Command's keywords, it will continue to show the filtered list at the end of the command.
To view the full transaction list, the user would be required to input the
Back Command where `BackCommand` calls `resetPredicate()`. The sequence diagram for the `BackCommand` is shown in the
 following section <<BackCommandSD, 3.1.3 BackCommand>>

After this, the list of transactions and reimbursement tab is updated as shown in <<updateTL, Figure 11>> and <<update-reimbursement,Figure 12>>
respectively.
The delete by index implementation would be similar but does not require interaction with the `Model` from the
`AddressBook` in the person package.
The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to delete a new transaction:

.Activity Diagram of Delete Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabActivityDiagramDeleteCommand.png[]

The above activity diagram assumes the index to be within the bounds of the table but if it is not, a response will
be shown about the incorrect input. Also, as shown above, response on other incorrect inputs will also be shown.
When a successful deletion is done, a response message is shown as well.

==== Back Command Feature
[[BackCommandSD]]
The `BackCommand` is not initialised by a specific command parser as shown in as shown in <<GeneralLogicSD, Interactions Inside the Logic Component for a Command>>
but initialised by the `TransactionTabParser` instead.
The following detailed sequence diagram shows how the back command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Back Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabBackCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

//==== Sort Command Feature
//The Sort Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature allows for 3 types of sort, by name in
//alphabetical order, by amount (from most to least) and by date (from oldest to most recent).

//The following sequence diagram shows how the sort command works:

//.Sequence Diagram of Sort Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

//image::HomeTabSortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

//When a user inputs the sort command, it is only checked that it is one of the 3 types or it will show a response about
//the incorrect user input. When it is successfully sorted, there will also be a response message shown.

//Similar to the Delete Command, since the `resetPredicate()` method is not called as shown, the UI table will
//continue to show the filtered transaction list if the prior input is a Find Command and the list at the start
//of the activity diagram shows a filtered list by the Find Command's keywords.
//To view the full transaction list, the user would have to input the
//Back Command that calls `resetPredicate()`.

=== Members Tab
This tab will help to keep track of the contact details of members in the club or society for the treasurer.

==== Delete Command Feature
This feature allows for deletion by
the index shown in the `Members Tab`. This tab integrates the existing `AddressBook`.
The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Delete Command in Member Tab (transaction package)

image::MembersDeleteSD.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Before, the deletion is done, there will be a check to the `TransactionModel` to ensure that the member is not linked
to any transaction records since every transaction must be linked to a `Person` in the `Members Tab` (`AddressBook`).


=== Reimbursement Tab
This tab helps to show reimbursements
that the user has not paid to a person.
Each reimbursement is auto extracted from transactions and grouped by person in transactions.
So, each reimbursement shows the total amount that the user needs to reimburse a person.
And there can not be two reimbursements that refer to the same person.

The user can add deadline to a reimbursement, mark a reimbursement,
find a reimbursement and sort reimbursements.

==== Deadline Command feature
This command is used to add a deadline date to a reimbursement for a person.
Deadline command requires access to the `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in.
Deadline field should be provided in a valid date format. The
person's name inputted has to match a person's name already existing in the `Reimbursement` which is shown in our Reimbursement
Tab.

The following sequence diagram shows the execution of deadline command:

.Sequence Diagram of Deadline Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSD.png[]

As shown, a user needs to add a deadline to a reimbursement by specifying
the person's name and providing a date.
The `DeadlineCommandParser` creates a `DeadlineCommand` with person and deadline date information.
This `DeadlineCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager` of reimbursement and is executed by calling `addDeadline` method in
`ModelManager`. After the operations, `LogicManager` gets updated reimbursement list from `ModelManager` and displays the deadline in reimbursement list.
After that, the deadline is saved into a `.txt` file.

.Activity Diagram of Deadline Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDeadlineCommand.png[]

As shown by the above activity diagram, when a user inputs a person who does not exist in any
reimbursement or keys in an invalid data format, our app displays the expected format of the deadline command.
Otherwise, when the execution is successful,
a response informs the user that deadline is successfully added to the reimbursement.

==== Find Command feature
This command is used to find a reimbursement that contains the person's name.
Find command requires access to `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in.
Person field should be provided and the person's name should exist in reimbursement list.

.Sequence Diagram of Find Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementFindCommandSD.png[]

A user needs to find a reimbursement by providing the person's name.
As shown in the above figure, `FindCommand` is executed by calling `findReimbursement` method in
`ModelManager`. After the operations, that reimbursement is returned
and reimbursement tab only shows a `filteredList` which contains this single reimbursement.

[[ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramFindCommand]]
.Activity Diagram of Find Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramFindCommand.png[]

The above activity diagram shows the steps needed for find command.
The person's name is checked whether it exists in reimbursement list.
If not, our app informs the user that command is incorrect. If command is valid, the reimbursement
is found and displayed in the tab.

==== Back Command feature
This command is used to return to the original list after executing find command

.Sequence Diagram of Back Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementBackCommandSD.png[]

`BackCommand` execution updates `filteredList` inside `ModelManager` to the original full `reimbursementList`.
After the operations, the original full reimbursement list is displayed.

==== Done Command feature
This command is used to mark a reimbursement that has been done.
Done command requires access to `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in.
Person field should be provided and the person's name should exist in reimbursement list.

[[ReimbursementDoneCommandSD]]
.Sequence Diagram of Done Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDoneCommandSD.png[]

A user needs to mark a reimbursement as done by specifying the person's name for the specific reimbursement.
The `DeadlineCommandParser` creates a `DoneCommand` with person's information.
As shown in the above figure, `DoneCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager`
and it is executed by calling `doneReimbursement` method in
`ModelManager`. After the operations, that reimbursement is deleted from reimbursement list
and the status of transactions that consist of this reimbursement is updated to `True`.
Then the updated reimbursement list is displayed and this new list without that deleted reimbursement is saved.

The following figure shows how transactions' status is updated. Firstly, the reimbursement
which contains the person's name updates status of all transactions that made up of the reimbursement.
Then `LogicManager` gets the updated transaction list and passes this list to `StorageManager`
of transaction tab to save it.

[[ReimbursementUpdateTransactionsSD]]
.Sequence Diagram of updating transactions in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementUpdateTransactionsSD.png[]

<<ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDoneCommand, The following activity diagram>> shows the steps needed for done command.
The person's name is checked whether it exists in reimbursement list.
If not, our app informs the user that command is incorrect. If command is valid, the reimbursement
containing the provided person's name is deleted from reimbursement list and will not be displayed.

[[ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDoneCommand]]
.Activity Diagram of Done Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDoneCommand.png[]

==== Sort Command feature
This command is used to sort reimbursements and the user can choose to sort based on name, amount or deadline.

.Sequence Diagram of Sort Command in Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementSortCommandSD.png[]

As shown in the above figure, `SortXYZCommand` is executed by calling `sortListByXYZ` method in
`ModelManager`. And reimbursement list is sorted using `SortByXYZ` comparator.
For `SortAmountCommand`, the list will be sorted in descending order of absolute value of amount.
For `SortNameCommand`, the list will be sorted in descending alphabetical order of person's name.
For `SortDeadlineCommand`, the list will be sorted in the order that nearest deadlines are at the front.

=== Inventory Tab

This tab will help to keep records of all items currently in the club’s possession.
Each item will require an input of its description, category, quantity, and cost per unit. Optionally, if the item is meant for
sale, the price can be inputted as well.

This is the overall Class Diagram of this tab:

.Class Diagram of Inventory Tab (inventory package)

image::InventoryTabClassDiagram.png[]

==== Add Item Feature
This features allows the adding of items to the inventory.

When adding a new item, the user is required to input the description, category, quantity and cost per unit of the item.
The only attribute that is optional is the price.

For an input to be valid, it must contain all four of the previously mentioned attributes, and the input for each attribute
must be of the correct type. For example, quantity and cost must be numbers. However, the attributes can be inputted in any
order.

The following sequence diagram shows how an add command works with the description, category, quantity, cost and price fields
present:

.Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Inventory Tab (inventory package)

_{ to be added }_

The following activity diagram displays the process of adding a new item to the inventory:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command in Inventory Tab (inventory package)

image::InventoryAddCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

As shown above, the input will be evaluated for its validity. If the input is not valid, the user will be informed through Leo
that the command was in an invalid format and reminded of the correct format.

Otherwise, the user will be informed through Leo that their input was successful, and the item will immediately be displayed in
the Table of the UI.

==== Delete Item Feature

==== Edit Item Feature

==== Sort Items Feature

==== [Proposed] Auto-Complete Feature


=== Cashier Tab
This tab will act as a shopping cart to add and record sales items that are to be sold from the inventory.

Upon every successful checkout, all the sales items sold will recorded as one transaction, which will subsequently be
appended to the list of transactions on the `Home tab`. In addition, the stock remaining in the inventory will be updated
accordingly in the `Inventory tab`.

[NOTE]
If the user key in a quantity where the total amount in table or subtotal of that row exceeds 2,147,483, 647, the range
of an integer, an exception will be thrown. This is the intended behaviour as the view cannot accommodate such large integers.
If it exceeds 2,147,483, 647, users are advised to key in a smaller quantity or checkout items separately.


==== Add Sales Item Feature
This feature allows the addition of sales items to the cart.

Only sales items can be added to the cart. If the price of an item is zero, it is not available for sale. The
system will prohibit any addition of such an item to the cart.

Adding of a sales item to the cart will require an input of its description and quantity. An optional field for
category is provided to guide the cashier to find the desired item. If the category field is input with other unspecified
description and quantity fields, `Model` will search all the sales items in the `Inventory List`
according to the specified category and suggestions would be shown by Leo, the assistant. +
If description and quantity field are both valid, the `ModelManager` will add the item into the sales list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `AddCommand` works and is the reference
from <<GeneralLogicSD, Interactions Inside the Logic Component for a Command>>:

.Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Cashier Tab (cashier package)

image::AddCommandCashierSeq.png[]

`AddCommandParser` will carry out multiple checks to check the validity of the inputs. `hasItemInInventory(description)`
and `hasSufficientQuantityToAdd(description, quantity)` methods will be called to ensure the item has sufficient stock
left in the inventory. +
There will also be checks to ensure that the item specified is available for sale.

[NOTE]
After every add command, the quantity of items in the Inventory Tab will still remain the same. The remaining stock
will only be updated after the Checkout Command.

The following activity diagram shows the steps proceeding after the user input an add command:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command (cashier package)

image::AddCommandCashierActivity.png[]


==== Setting the Cashier Feature
This feature allows an existing person in the `Address Book` to be set as a cashier. The only field required is
the name of an existing person.

To set a cashier, the person's name inputted has to match an existing name in the `AddressBook` as shown on `Members Tab`.
This means that SetCommandParser requires access to the `Model` of the person package where the `AddressBook` implementation is. +
If the person's name cannot be found in the `Model` of the person package, a response message will be shown by Leo,
informing the user that there is no such person.

The following sequence diagram shows how the SetCashierCommandParser checks for an existing person:

.Sequence Diagram of SetCashierCommandParser (cashier package)

If the specified name is valid, the `Model` of the cashier package will set the person as cashier.

The following sequence diagram shows how the set cashier command works and is the reference
from <<GeneralLogicSD, Interactions Inside the Logic Component for a Command>>:

==== Checkout Feature
This feature confirms all the sales items in the table as one sales transaction under the `Sales` category.

The `Home Tab` will be updated with the new transaction labelled as `Items sold`. The remaining stock of the sales items
will also be updated on the `Inventory Tab`.

During the execution of the command, `getCashier()` method will be called which will return a person. This person will
be used to create a `Transaction` object. If the cashier is null, the command cannot proceed and Leo will
prompt the user to set a cashier. +
If the amount inputted is valid and cashier has been set, the `ModelManager` will create a new
transaction of the sales made.

[NOTE]
After the execution of the above methods, a clear command will then be called to clear all the sales items on the tab.

The following sequence diagram shows how the checkout command is executed:

.Sequence Diagram of Checkout Command (cashier package)

image::CheckoutCommandCashierSeq1.png[]

The `Cashier Logic` will call relevant methods to update the inventory list and newly-generated transaction
to the respective `.txt file`. +
To update the view on the `Inventory Tab` and `Transaction Tab`, transaction will be added to the transaction model and
`readInUpdatedList()` method of inventory model will called to read in the entire inventory data file.

The following sequence diagram shows how the transaction and inventory are updated:

.Sequence Diagram of how transaction and inventory get updated (cashier package)

image::CheckoutCommandCashierSeq2.png[]

If the amount inputted is less than the total amount of items, the user will be prompted to key in a valid value.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a checkout command:

=== Overview Tab

This tab displays summary statistics for the data within treasurerPro. There are four main statistics shown:

. Expense Summary: Pie chart of expenditure by category.
. Inventory Summary: Pie chart of inventory by category.
. Sales Summary: Bar chart of sales by months.
. Budget Overview: Line chart of budget remaining by months.

The above summaries are automatically updated whenever new data is entered from any of the other tabs.

The class diagram for this package is shown as follows:

==== Set command
For each summary statistic, the user may set targets that they plan to achieve/abide by.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice.
For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
