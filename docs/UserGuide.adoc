=== UI Display

==== Viewing Schedules
When the Scheduler starts, interview schedules will be displayed for you. The data will be displayed in a table format,
with each table representing the schedule for each day. In the first column, the date of that interview schedule will be
displayed, the rest of the columns are the departments and the name of their respective person in charge. Subsequent rows
will be be displayed by showing the time slot first, with the person allocated to that time slot. If there are no interviewee
occupying that time slot, it will be displayed as "0".
