    "description": "This is an introduction to the major income tax issues faced by businesses operating in a global economy. These issues include causes of multiple taxation, strategies to avoid multiple taxation, the effectiveness of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) and the abuse of DTAs. The module will be taught using typical transactions of capital and income flows as the focus and method of instruction. It will identify the main tax risks from undertaking cross-border transactions. As part of the management and mitigation of tax costs to a MNC, tax planning opportunities in the form of tax arbitrage, tax havens, choice of investment vehicle, corporate funding, inbound and outbound investments as well as the repatriation of income and capital will be discussed. The course will also identify the global tax trends arising from increased mobility of capital, technological advancements as well as demographics. In particular, the module will address some of the major issues and challenges that are being addressed in the most ambitious international tax reform under the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2015 (BEPS) initiative ever attempted. As this course seeks to illustrate some of the general strategies in international tax planning, no prior knowledge of country-specific tax rules is required. Instead, the latest OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 will used as a primary source of laws for the purpose of this module.",
