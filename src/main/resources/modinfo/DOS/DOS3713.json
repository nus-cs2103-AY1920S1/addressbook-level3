    "description": "The global trend towards shorter life cycles for products and services has led many companies to focus on improving their approaches to managing change. Many organizations increasingly recognize that introducing new products, processes, or programs in a timely and cost effective manner requires professional project management. This course examines the management of complex projects and the tools that are available to assist managers with planning and controlling such projects. Some of the specific topics we will discuss include project selection, project teams and organizational issues, project monitoring and control, project risk management, project resource management, and managing multiple projects. Both ?traditional? applications of project management (such as engineering or construction projects) and ?modern? ones (such as IT projects or change management) will be discussed. The course includes extensive use of software products that are available to assist project managers. We will study the relationship between these products and the requirements of managing large, complex projects.",
