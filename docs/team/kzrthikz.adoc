== PROJECT: ModuleBook

== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my role and contributions to the ModuleBook project.

My team of four software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface
desktop addressbook application. It is a requirement for CS2103T Software Engineering project taught at National
University of Singapore(NUS). We chose to morph it into a module tracking cum management application called ModuleBook.

This application is tailored to meet the needs of NUS studentsâ€™ module management problems. It helps students to
find and track modules, manage module-specific deadlines and other useful information like quick-links.
ModuleBook is a desktop application where user interacts with it using CLI, and it has GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write codes for the management of module deadline feature. The following sections illustrate
these enhancements in more details, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to these enhancements.


== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major Enhancement:*
Added the *deadline management feature*.

** What it does: Allows users to create deadlines by adding description, due date and priority.
Deadline tasks are colored to indicate priority and sorted according to priority, date and time.
Users can record their progress by marking deadline tasks as done, in progress or undone. They can edit and delete
as well.

** Justification: This benefits students to keep track of the countless deadlines, especially if student is lazy to
manually keep track of them. For busy and forgetful students, it helps them to prioritise and
organise deadlines for each module. For students who prefer easy navigation and flexibility, deadline feature is
customisable as users can easily edit, mark and delete deadlines.

** Highlights: This enhancement automatically sorts deadlines according to priority, date and time when user
adds a deadline task. There is no need for users to sort again after adding deadline tasks.

* *Minor Enhancement:* refactored part of commands and parsers.
