    "description": "'What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger' is a common saying that implies a positive response to external stress. Yet, beyond the rhetorics, this notion is grounded in scientific principles. The goal of this module is to first discuss the theoretical basis behind this effect, and then to explore the reach of this phenomenon across different disciplines. These include addressing the risk-benefits of medications and health supplements, the effects of exercise on the physical body, concept of immunity and others. Beyond that, we hope to generate a platform for a deep dialogue on the potential analogies of the concept in far-reaching domains such as sociology, psychology and even economics (antifragility). Through this, we hope to advocate the theories and practice of taking 'calculated risk' in life situations.",
