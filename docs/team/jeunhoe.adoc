== Overview
This project portfolio details my key contributions to the software engineering project *Athletick*.

=== About the project
*Athletick* is a desktop team-management application designed for coaches and captains who manage time-based sports
(e.g. swimming, racing) teams. *Athletick* allows users to manage athlete information, record training sessions and
save competition results. *Athletick* also allows users to monitor their training schedule and track an athlete’s
attendance, performance and sporting progress. This enables users to better manage their team, plan for trainings and prepare for upcoming
competitions.

=== About the team
*Athletick* was designed by a team of student athletes who were passionate about making team-management hassle-free for
captains and coaches. Our team comprises of five second-year computer science undergraduates from the National
University of Singapore (NUS) and we created *Athletick* as part of a requirement for our second-year software
engineering module. We were tasked with morphing a desktop address book application with the constraint that it had
to be a command line interface application. This project was completed over six weeks.

== Summary of contributions
This section contains a summary of my contributions to the project. This includes code, documentation and other helpful
contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added:* I added the ability to add and delete training information.

* What it does:
** The `training` command adds training information to *Athletick*. Users store the date of training and
players attended, allowing them to view, edit and delete past training data.

* Justification:
** Coaches and captains keep records of past trainings so they can use the information to manage their team.
Allowing them to store training dates helps them to monitor their training schedule and plan for future training
programs. We also allow storage of attendance information as a coach or captain would want to know attendance for that
training
session.

* Highlights:
** The training feature was designed to function as a standalone unit and does not rely on any other
components. This allows for easy extension of the feature to cater to different users. We have plans to extend the
training feature to include more information, like type of training (e.g. gym training, sprints training) and athlete
performance.

** There are 2 variations of the `training` command. This allows users to indicate attendance of a training
by listing members present, or by members absent. We understand that keying player attendance can be very tedious for
big teams. Giving the option to coaches and captains to mark attendance by entering players absent will reduce the
amount of typing which will save time.

* Credits:
** Saving of training data into .json files is done with the use of the Jackson library.

*Enhancement added:* I added the ability to monitor an athlete’s attendance.

* What it does:
** A built-in attendance tracker allows users to track their team’s attendance using the `attendance`, `select`,
`view attendance` and `calendar` commands.


* Justification:
** Coaches and captains are concerned about their team’s overall attendance rate as it is a good indicator an
athlete’s commitment and how prepared an athlete is for a competition. Providing an automatic attendance tracker
removes the need for manual calculation as it can be tedious for them, especially if they have to go
through many training sessions.

* Highlight:
** Attendance of a particular training is used in the `calendar` command and attendance rate is used in the
`select` command. A TrainingManager was implemented to provide other components use with important information from
training information and attendance rate.
