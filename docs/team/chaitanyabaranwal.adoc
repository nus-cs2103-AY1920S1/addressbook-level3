== Overview

Insurelytics is a desktop client management application for insurance agents.
Insurelytics facilitates the tracking of client and policies, and also generate statistical analytics to provide insights for the agent.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 85 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous data changes, and view previous history of commands*

** *What it does:* The features relating to this enhancement can be divided into two components:
*** *Undo/redo previous data changes*: Allows the user to undo/redo any data changes made to the insurance data in the
current session.
*** *View a history of previously entered valid commands*: Allows the user to view a history of previously entered
valid commands.

** *Justification:* A user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
Given the sensitivity and size of data handled by a single insurance agent, it is quite possible to mistakenly enter erroneous data.
The `history` command is also very useful, since the user would often want to see the previously entered commands to note the changes he/she made.

** *Highlights:* This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation too was challenging
as it required changes to existing commands and key components like `ModelManager` and `LogicManager`, as well as implementation
of completely new components.

** *Credits:* The code for `StatefulAddressBook.java` is adapted from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[this repo],
although I made sure that I completely understood the implementation and wrote the code for this application myself. The
`history` command did not use any previously existing code.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a functionality that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

** Different from the `history` command, because this stores the entered commands in a separate list, and provides all commands
entered regardless of whether they were valid or not. The idea is to provide incorrectly entered commands so that the user
can quickly navigate to that command and perform the required changes to enter the correct command.
