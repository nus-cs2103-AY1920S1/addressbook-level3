    "description": "This module - which is offered to all students with an interest in Modern European History - will explore the significant features and impact of nationalism, imperialism and adventurism as they relate to Europe in the dramatic seventy-year period from the upheavals of the 1848 revolutions to the end of the First World War. During this period Europe became the center of a new and deadly game of power politics in which any semblance of defeat was reason enough to prepare the ground for revenge. Eventually, war took its toll on every major participant from 1914-18.",
