    "description": "This module examines the relationships between language, gender and sexuality. Specifically, it explores how gender and sexuality are constructed, performed, constrained and resisted in and through language. The study is undertaken using a critical lens to understand relations of power, investment and ideology for individuals and social groups in particular communities of practice. In the module, students will explore issues of language, gender and sexuality bearing in mind cultural differences, and examine and evaluate research across a range of fields: language and gender, queer linguistics, sociolinguistics, feminist discourse analysis and feminist media and cultural studies.",
