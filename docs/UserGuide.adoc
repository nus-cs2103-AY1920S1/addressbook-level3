== Introduction

DukeAcademy is a coding practice platform that operates entirely on your local machine without the need for an internet
connection. Whether you are revising for a test, practicing for a tech interview, or just coding for the sheer joy of
it, DukeAcademy gives you access to a wide range of programming problems from various categories. Easily find something
that suits your needs and interests and start honing your skills today!

For educators, you can use DukeAcademy as a platform to administer your assignments or practice questions by loading
your own questions!

DukeAcademy is optimized for those who prefer to work with a CLI (Command Line Interface) while still enjoying the
benefits of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). If you are still unfamiliar with using a CLI (an important skill for all
programmers), you can get used to it while working on your coding skills!
