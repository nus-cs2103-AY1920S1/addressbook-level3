== Introduction
What is TravelPal? First and foremost, it is a cross-platform desktop application for those
who love to plan and micromanage their travels. It includes various features to help in
planning the trip beforehand, such as an itinerary planner, a pre-trip inventory manager,
bookings and expense manager.

During the trip, there is also an inbuilt diary application that
allows the user to record details of the trip, and a contacts manager to store important
contacts related to the trip.

In addition, it’s primary preferred form of input from the user is
the Command Line Interface (CLI), but it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for
those who like to use alternative inputs.

Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

====
*General Command tips*

* Most commands are in the format of `<command> <argument1> <argument2> <...>`
* `<command>` is case insensitive, so typing it in any combination of UPPER_CASE or lower_case will work.
* Leading and trailing white spaces in the inputted command are ignored.
* Some `<arguments>` consists of two parts, namely a `prefix/` followed immediately by an `argument`
** `prefix/` s are a combination of no more than three letters, followed by a `/`, and are case sensitive

====

=== Trip manager

The __Trip Manager__ page is the main starting ground of the application. Here, you can view and enter the trips you have created.

If you are using TravelPal for the first time, you will see a blank page, to create a new trip, please follow the instruction in <<Trip setup>>.

After a trip is successfully added, information about the trip is shown in a trip card as shown below.

image::TripManager.png[]

On the __Trip Manager__ page, the following command are available:

* `create` : creates a new trip, this command brings up the trip setup user interface.
* `delete <index of trip>` : deletes the trip with the specified index and all data associated with it.
* `goto <index of trip>`  : enters the main page of a trip with the specified index.

=== Trip setup
Trip setup is the first step in configuring a new/existing trip! This requires you to be at the __Trip Manager__ page (the landing page).


Now you can enter the command `create` or `edit <index>` to create a new trip or edit an existing trip.

Upon commands to create or edit a specified trip from the Trip Manager, the user will be directed to a page where they can edit the necessary details to create a new trip. This page will contain a form with 5 necessary fields:

- Name
- Start Date
- End Date
- Total Budget
- Destination

The last field Photo is an optional field, a default image will be used if the user does not submit any image.


If the `create` command was executed, you will be displayed an empty form with no details filled in.

image::createTrip.png[]

If `edit` command was executed, you will be displayed a from with details previously filled in.


image::editTrip.png[]

Now that you on the edit page, to edit a specific field, execute the following command: `edit <prefix>/<value> <prefixes>/<value> ...`. There are 6 different prefixes, each to edit one of the 6 fields displayed. The 6 prefixes refer to editing each fields as follows:

1. Name :  `n/`
2. Start Date : `ds/`
3. End Date : `de/`
4. Total Budget : `b/`
5. Destination : `l/`
6. Photo File Path : `fp/`

    Note:
    You can execute fc/ with fp/ to open a file dialog to choose an image rather than type in absoulute path of the image.
e.g. edit fp/ fc/

Below is an example changing the name of an existing trip to "Small Trip":

- You begin at the edit trip screen, the original name of the trip is the same as before.

image::editTrip.png[]
- Enter the command `edit n/Small Trip` into the command box and press enter to execute.

image::editNameCommand.png[]
- The name of the trip is now "Small Trip"!

image::editNameCommandResult.png[]

Having completed editing the the form, you can submit it by executing the `done` command or the `cancel` command which will confirm your edit or discard it respectively.

You have successfully created/edited a trip!

=== Event Setup

Event setup creates/edits properties of a specified event. It is necessary for event to contains a starting and ending time. Events contains mostly optional fields that the user can edit in future. The syntax is as follows: `edit <prefix>/<value>`

1. Name : `n/`
2. Start Date : `ds/`
3. End Date: `de/`
4. Total Budget: `b/`
5. Destination: `l/`

=== Navbar
Every page that comprises a navbar can execute the following commands to navigate to another page.

1. Trip Manager: `home`
2. Itinerary : `itinerary`
3. Days Page: `days`
4. Diary : `diary`
5. Inventory : `inventory`
6. Expense Manager : `expense`

=== Expense Manager

=== Diary

==== Introduction

Welcome to the diary feature of _TravelPal_! The diary allows you to key in various thoughts and add photos that tie
to each day of the trip. It offers a selection of formatting choices for your text display, and has an
additional gallery display to the right that allows you to take a glance at all your photos quickly. Moreover, for almost
every command, there are gui alternatives that allow you to execute the same operations.

This section of the user guide explains how to use the diary.

==== Diary User Interface Overview

Shown below are the key elements of the diary page, while the gallery is in view.

NOTE: There is an alternative mode of display (which will be touched on shortly, or see <<diary_editor_display_mode>>),
that shows when you execute the `editor` command <<diary_editor_command>> or click the `Edit` button.

image::diary/userguide/welcome_to_diary_image_annotated.png[title="Overview of diary user interface"]

===== Diary Entry Display Area
This is the main display area of your diary entry. It is able to display text, along with inline images, or just lines of
images. The content is generated from the diary text of the entry (<<diary_text_info>>).

[[diary_gallery_display]]
===== Gallery Display
The gallery allows you to browse through your stored photos. You can scroll the list simply with your mouse wheel.

image::diary/userguide/diary_photo_user_interface.png[title="Display of a photo in the gallery display"]

Each image is displayed with a description (bottom left), a date taken (top right), both of which are user specifiable.
There is also a photo index
(top left), which is for use in various commands (see <<diary_text_displaying_images>>).

[[diary_current_day_indicator]]
===== Current Day Indicator
This is simply some helper text for you to know what day the diary entry you are currently viewing is tied to.

[[diary_day_navigation_bar]]
===== Diary Day Navigation Bar
This is the button equivalent of the `flip` command (<<diary_flip_command>>), and allows you to navigate between your
diary entries for different days by clicking on the respective buttons.

[[diary_gallery_button_bar]]
===== Gallery Button Bar
This smaller button bar is used for executing two other commands. Firstly, the `editor` (<<diary_editor_command>>)
can be executede by clicking on the _Edit_ button. Secondly, the `addphoto` command may be executed
(<<diary_addphoto_command>>) through _Add_ button.

[[diary_add_new_entry_button]]
===== Add New Entry Button
Similarly, this button executes the `create` command through the user interface, as described in <<diary_create_entry_command>>.

[[diary_editor_display_mode]]
==== Diary Editor User Interface

This is the screen that shows when the `editor` command (<<diary_editor_command>>) is executed or the _Edit_ button
is clicked, as mentioned in <<diary_gallery_button_bar>>.

Components not highlighted in <<diary_edit_view_annotated>> below function the same way as mentioned in
<<Diary User Interface Overview>>.

[[diary_edit_view_annotated]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_edit_view_annotated.png[title="Overview of diary user interface when the edit box is shown"]

===== Diary Edit Box
This is the text edit area that allows a convenient form of alternative input to commands for editing the Diary Entry.
While you may feel that the special clauses _"<images 2>"_ and _"<images 5 1 3 4>"_ being used in the diagram above are
rather unfamiliar, they are actually quite simple! (see <<Diary Text>>).

TIP: For the command line input savvy users, you can use the `F1` accelerator to quickly move your keyboard focus
back to the command line input!

===== Commit Edit Button
This is simply the button-equivalent of the `done` command (<<diary_done_command>>), and allows you to commit the
changes you made (either through commands, or directly in the edit box) while the edit box was open.

[[diary_text_info]]
==== Diary Text

The **diary text**, as you edit in the edit box (<<Diary Edit Box>>), or edit through the commands described in
<<Diary Commands>>, are one and the same **diary text!** Hence, any commands you input to edit the text are reflected into
the edit box automatically, and any edits you make to the edit box are considered by the commands.

The diary text consists of *paragraphs*, which are simply texts separated by new line / return characters.

NOTE: A paragraph of text need not span a minimum length, and can even be empty, as seen in the empty orange boxes
in <<diary_text_line_numbering_figure>>

Additionally, the diary text can use special clauses to display and format images, as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.

[[diary_text_line_numbering]]
===== Diary Text Line Numbering
Each **paragraph** of text as seen in the edit box or diary entry display (with optional accompanying image(s)) is tied to a
specific **line number**. This **line number** is simply determined by the order of the text paragraphs as shown
in <<diary_text_line_numbering_figure>>, from top to bottom.

[[diary_text_line_numbering_figure]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_what_is_a_paragraph.png[title = "Annotated highlights of paragraphs and their line numbers with alternating colours"]

This **line number** is used for several commands described in <<Diary Commands>>.

NOTE: It is trivial if using the edit box to edit text, as text editing is done directly on the **diary text**.

[[diary_text_displaying_images]]
===== Displaying images
There are currently two main formats in which you can display images inside the diary entry display.

Both of them use simple clauses that require the numbering of the photo as displayed in the gallery.

====== As a mini horizontal gallery of images.
** Format: Use a diary **text paragraph** consisting of only the clause `<images number1 number2 numberN>`, where `numberN`
is the index of the photo as displayed in the gallery (<<diary_gallery_display>>).
** Example: `<images 5 1 3 4>` - displays a mini gallery with the images 1, 3 and 5 as shown in the gallery.

image::diary/userguide/diary_mini_gallery_edit_box.png[]

====== As an inline image with an accompanying paragraph of text.
** Format: Use a diary **text paragraph** consisting of your desired text, along with the clause
`<images numberN>`, where `numberN` is the index of the photo as displayed in the gallery <<diary_gallery_display>>.
** By default, the clause will place the image on the right, and the text on the left. You can include the `'left'`
word inside the `<images left numberN>` clause as such to reverse the order.
** Sample usage:

image::diary/userguide/diary_mini_gallery_edit_box.png[]
// end::diary_ppp[]

==== Diary Operations

The diary commands follow the same general format used by the rest of `TravelPal`.

[[diary_create_entry_command]]
===== Creating a diary entry
To start, you would want to create a new diary entry for a certain day. There are two options,
the former being the `create` command which offers slightly more flexibility.

====== Using the `create <dayN>` command
* Usage: Creates a new diary entry for *any* specified day number.
* Arguments:
** `<dayN>` - Positive integer nth day of the trip, which has not yet been created, and is less than or equal to
the last day of your trip.

[[diary_create_entry_command_button]]
====== Using the add entry button `+`

* Usage: Creates a new diary entry for the day right after the latest day's entry you currently have.

'''
====== Example Usage

Scenario: You already have entries for days 1 up to 8, and you want to create a new entry for day 9.

. Type in the `create 9` command in the command line input, then press enter, or simply click the `+` button as shown
below.
.. For the add entry button `+` (<<diary_create_entry_command_button>>), since the current latest day's entry is day 8,
it would create an entry for the day right after that, which is day 9.
+
[[diary_create_entry_command_before]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_create_command_with_button.png[title="Example usage of creating a new diary entry for day 9"]

. That's it! the diary entry will be successfully created, and you will be brought to the new diary entry's screen without
having to navigate to it via <<diary_flip_command>> automatically.
.. The edit box will also be opened automatically, as shown below, and you can start editing with it right away!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_create_command_command_after.png[title="Example result of post diary entry creation"]

[[diary_flip_command]]
===== Navigating to a diary entry
Next, say you wanted to view or edit a different day's diary entry, be it during your trip, or long after the trip. There
are also two options here to suit your needs, both offering the exact same functionality.

====== Using the `flip <dayN>` command
* Usage: Flips the diary to the diary entry of the day number specified.
* Arguments:
** `<dayN>` - Positive integer of the nth day's diary entry to flip to.

====== Using the diary entry navigation bar
* Usage: Clicking the the button of with the day number of the diary entry in the navigation bar (<<diary_day_navigation_bar>>)
will flip to the diary entry for that day.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario: You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 9, which is empty, and you want to view the diary entry for day 3.

. You should type in the `flip 3` command in the command line input, then press enter, or click the navigation button `3` for
day 3, as highlighted below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_flip_command_with_button.png[title="Example usage of flipping the diary to day 3's diary entry"]

. That's all! You will be brought to the entry for day 3, as shown below. You should see a brief confirmation message in
the command result box, and that the current day indicator will update accordingly (<<diary_current_day_indicator>>).

image::diary/userguide/diary_flip_command_command_after.png[title="Example result of after flipping back to the diary entry for day 3"]

// tag::diary_ppp2[]
[[diary_addphoto_command]]
===== Adding a photo
If you have just created a fresh diary entry, and you're wondering where to go next, then you
may want to start by adding your photos to display in the gallery (<<diary_gallery_display>>).

Here, there are 3 options for you to choose, the last option being the least flexible but also the fastest, if
you are more comfortable with using the user interface than the command line input.

In all options, the image file chosen should be of the file types `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`

WARNING: The image files are not copied to where your the _TravelPal_ application file is. Instead, the absolute file path
(see <<glossary>>) to the image file on your computer is stored! If you move or delete the original image on your system,
then you will have to add the photo again, and a placeholder image will be shown in place of your image.

====== Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix
* Usage: Typing in the command `addphoto fp/<file path> [d/<description>] [dts/<date taken>]`, with the
arguments described below, will add the image file located at the specified file
path on your computer to the gallery display.
* Arguments:
** `<file path>` - Relative file path from the location of the _TravelPal's_ jar file, or an absolute file path.
** `<description>` (optional) - The description of the photo to be shown in the gallery, of maximum length 20.
If left unspecified, the file name, truncated to the maximum length is used instead.
** `<date taken>` (optional) - The date taken of the photo, of the format d/M/yyyy HHmm.
If left unspecified, the last modified date of the file is used instead.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario:

* You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 1, which is empty, and you want to add a new photo.
* You are also a command line savvy user that loves and understands how to manually specify relative or absolute
file paths (see <<glossary>>), hence you opted for this option,
rather than <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix>> or <<Using the `add` button under the gallery display>>.
* Also, you want to give the photo a custom description, but want to use the last modified date of the image file in your
computer as the date taken for the photo. Shown below is an example of the photo on your computer you want to add,
`snowymountains.jpg`, that is located in the same place as the _TravelPal_ application.

image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_filepath_directory.png[title="Example file directory structure of the TravelPal application and snowymountains.jpg"]

. You should type in the `addphoto fp/snowymountains.jpg d/picturesque mountains` command in the command line input, then press enter, or click the navigation button `3` for
day 3, as highlighted below.
.. Here, the relative `<file path>` is simply the name of the file, `snowymountains.jpg`, since the image file is located in the
same directory as the _TravelPal_ application.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filepath.png[title="Example usage of the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` option"]

. The photo, with the specified description and last modified date will be added. You should see a brief confirmation message in
the command result box.
.. Additionally, there will be a auto-generated photo numbering, for use as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.

image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filepath_result.png[title="Example result of after executing the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` option"]

'''

====== Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix
* Usage: Typing in the command `addphoto fc/ [d/<description>] [dts/<date taken>]`, with the
arguments described below, will add the image file located at the specified file
path on your computer to the gallery display.
* Arguments:
** `fc/` - opens your system's user interface dialog to allow choosing an image (of file types `.jpg .jpeg .png`).
** `<description>` & `<date taken>` (optional) - as described in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix>>.

NOTE: The `fc/` prefix takes precedence over the `fp/` argument if both are specified.

====== Using the `Add` button under the gallery display
* Usage: Clicking the `Add` button located under the gallery display area (<<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will open your
system's user interface dialog to choose an image file.
* If this option is used, then the `<description>` & `<date taken>` are not specifiable and will be auto generated as described
in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix>>.

'''
====== Example Usage for `addphoto` command with `fc/` option or `add` button

Scenario:

* You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 1, which is empty, and you want to add a new photo using your system's
file choosing user interface, leaving the
application to generate the `<description>` and `<date taken>` fields automatically.
* Also, the image file you want to add is `snowymountains.jpg`, and is not located in the same place as the _TravelPal_ application.

. You can type in the `addphoto fc/` command in the command line input as highlighted in yellow below, and press the 'enter' key,
or you can click the `Add` button.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser.png[title="Example usage of adding a photo through the `addphoto` command using the `fc/` option, or the `Add` button"]

NOTE: In this example, the `<description>` and `<date taken>` fields are automatically generated. However, if you are using
the `addphoto fc/` command, you may specify them manually as described in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix>>

[start=2]
. Your system's file chooser user interface, which may look different depending on your operating system (windows / mac / linux) (see <<glossary>>)
will be opened, as shown below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_step2.png[title="Example file chooser user interface for the windows operating system"]

. Next, you can simply use the file chooser user interface to choose an image located anywhere on your computer!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_step3.png[title="Example image file in the file chooser user interface to add"]

. That's it! Your photo, with the auto generated image name and date will be placed into your gallery, and you will see a
confirmation message in the result display.
.. Additionally, there will be a auto-generated photo numbering, for use as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_result.png[title="Result after choosing the image 'qidu_marketplace.jpg' in step 3"]

===== Deleting a photo
If you mistakenly added a photo to the wrong diary entry, or want to remove a certain photo from an entry, you can
use the `delphoto` command to do so.
// end::diary_ppp2[]
====== Using the `delphoto <photo number>` command
* Usage: Deletes a photo, indicated by the specified photo number, as displayed by the photo's numbering in the gallery.
* Arguments:
** `<photo number>` - Positive integer number of the photo to delete, as shown by the numbering in the gallery (see <<diary_gallery_display>>).

'''
====== Example Usage
Scenario: You mistakenly added the photo 'qidu_marketplace.jpg' to your diary entry for day 1 when it should have been
added the day 2's diary entry.

. You type in the `delphoto 1` command to delete the image with the same `1` numbering as shown in the gallery, and
press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delphoto_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `delphoto` command to delete the photo with number 1"]

. Your photo will be deleted from the gallery, and a confirmation message will be shown!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delphoto_command_result.png[title="Result of `delphoto` command to delete the photo with number 1"]


'''

NOTE: The commands below are quick command line equivalents of editing the text in the edit box, as described in
<<diary_editor_display_mode>>.

TIP: If you execute any command that changes the diary entry's text while the edit box is open, then the command still
works and the save behaviour is exactly the same as described in <<diary_editor_command>>!. That is, your edits will
be not be committed until you execute the `done` command (see <<diary_done_command>>).

===== Appending to a diary entry
If you are currently viewing a diary entry, and know how to format the entry text (see <<diary_text_info>>),
then you could use with the `append` command to add a new paragraph of text.

. You type in the `append` command, along with a simple line of text without images:
`append After an entire day's drive, we arrived at the bustling city of Tai Chung`, and then you press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_append_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `append` command to add a new paragraph of text to a diary entry"]
. That's it! Your new paragraph will be saved and displayed automatically as shown below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_append_command_after.png[title="Result of `append` command to add a new paragraph of text"]

===== Inserting text in a diary entry
If you have a long diary entry, and want to insert a new paragraph of text between some existing paragraphs without
using the edit box (<<diary_editor_command>>), then you can use the `insert` command.

====== Using the `insert i/<lineNumber> d/<paragraph>` command

to delete a paragraph of text in the entry!

====== Using the `delete i/<lineNumber>` command
* Usage: Deletes the line of text at the specified line number.
* Arguments:

[[diary_editor_command]]
===== Showing the edit box
As an alternative to commands that allow you to edit your diary entry, you can also use the edit box to do so, as described
in <<diary_editor_display_mode>>. Note that any edits through the edit box or command made while the editor was opened
need to be saved by using the `done` command or button (see <<diary_done_command>>).To show the editor, there are two equivalent options.

====== Using the `editor` command
* Usage: Opens the text editor window and shifts the keyboard focus to it, if it is not already opened.

====== Using the `Edit` button
* Usage: Clicking the `Edit` button located under the gallery display area (<<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will open the editor.

'''

====== Example Usage
Scenario: You have just begun writing your diary entry, and even though you are a command line enthusiast, you recall the existence of
command line text editors, such as _vim_, which can greatly improve the typing experience.

Thus, you opted for using the edit box to write your diary entry, instead of repeating the same commands multiple times.

. You type in the `editor` command, and press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_editor_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `editor` command to open the edit window"]
. That's all! The edit box is opened, and the keyboard focus is shifted to it.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_editor_command_after.png[title="Result of `editor` command showing the opened edit window"]

TIP: In true command line fashion, you can still return the keyboard focus to the command line input without the mouse
by pressing the 'F1' key!

[[diary_done_command]]
===== Committing your edits
If you have the edit box opened, any edits you make, through commands or the editor, are not saved until you tell
_TravelPal_ to do so! To do this, there are two options, the first being the `done` command and the second being the
`Done` button.

====== Using the `done` command
** Usage: Saves the text currently in the edit box to the diary entry, and closes the editor.
** Example: `done`

====== Using the `Done` button
* Usage: Clicking the `Done` button located under the gallery display area (<<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will similarly
save the changes you made while the editor was open, and close the editor.

=== Pre-trip Inventory Manager

Allows the user to make a list of things (inventory of things) he/she needs for the trip.

* add <item> : adds an item to the inventory list
* delete <index of item> : deletes the item at the specified index from the inventory list


== General info

====
* Save data:
** The data of the trips is saved in the data directory located in the data directory where the _TravelPal_ application file, TravelPal.jar is.
** The data is stored in a human readable json format, allowing manual editing of the data files using a separate text editor.
* Window size:
** You might have noticed that you cannot resize the _TravelPal_ application any smaller than a certain size (specifically, 800 x 600).
** _TravelPal_ was designed as a desktop application, hence many of its contents will not display correctly given too small
a window size.

====

[[glossary]]
== Glossary
* Relative file path - the file path from the directory of the _TravelPal_ application file. For example,
`.\sample_picture.jpg`  is an relative file path referring to an image file `sample_picture.jpg` existing in the same directory
as the _TravelPal_ application file.
* Absolute file path - the file path from your computer's root directory, which can vary from system to system. For example,
`C:\Users\Public\Pictures`  is an absolute file path from the root directory of your computer's `C:\` drive.
