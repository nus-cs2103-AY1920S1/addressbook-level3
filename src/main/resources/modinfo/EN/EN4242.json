    "description": "This module trains students in the reading and analysis of influential texts in critical theory, as the basis for examining the production and historical grounds of textual meaning. This survey course provides a comprehensive understanding of major critical theories of the twentieth century: post-structuralism and discourse-analysis, psychoanalysis, twentieth-century Marxism, and post-colonial studies. Close readings of Foucault, Lacan and Adorno in particular, will equip students to engage in wide-ranging and sometimes complex debates about critical approaches to the study of cultural meaning, its production and interpretation. The module targets students with interests in critical questions.",
