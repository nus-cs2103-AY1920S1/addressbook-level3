====
*Command Format for Horo*

* You can enter a command by typing the command name first followed by arguments of the command.
- E.g. `*command_name* <argument1> <argument2>...`

* If you want to type an argument containing blank spaces, surround your sentence within quotation marks.
- E.g. `"Buy Groceries"`
- E.g. `*add_task* "Buy Groceries"`

* Command parameters are prefixed by `--`, and they are optional.
- E.g. `*--date* 09/2019`
- E.g. `*calendar* *--date* 09/2019`

====
*Command Format for this User Guide*

* Arguments are fully capitalized which are to be supplied by you.
- E.g. `*add_task* TASK`

* Arguments suffixed with ellipsis (`...`) indicate that the argument can be entered zero or more times.
- E.g. `*delete_task* INDEX...`

* Parameters separated by a vertical bar `|` can be used interchangeably.
- e.g. given the command format `-d|--description DESCRIPTION`, the following inputs accomplish the same thing:
- `*--description* "Buy Groceries"`
- `*-d* "Buy Groceries"`

=== Calendar, Events and Task

The following commands are related to Events and Tasks, which Horo recognises as different entities. Stated below are the differences between Events and Tasks:

* Event:
- Will show up on the Calendar.
- Cannot be marked as done. **`[coming in v2.0]`**
- Will be automatically removed from the Calendar past its due date, provided it is a non-recurring event.

* Task
- Will show up on the Calendar only if a due-date is specified. Otherwise it will be specified in the List.
- Can be marked as done. **`[coming in v2.0]`**
- If not accomplished by its due date, will be automatically archived into an undone list.

=== Notification System
Horo will post notifications to your system tray to remind you that an event is starting or that a task is due.

Take note that Horo can only post reminders as long as the application is open. To tell if Horo is running, check that the appropriate icon appears in the system tray

.Horo tray icon
image::HoroIconScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
Also take note that notifications are switched on by default upon launch. This status is not carried over between sessions. If you would like to switch notifications off, you would have to do so whenever you start Horo up.

You can tell if notifications are switched on by mousing over the icon in the system tray.

.Mousing over the Horo tray icon
image::IconMouseOverScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

==== Notification Popups
When Horo posts a notification, it should appear at the bottom-right side of the screen, where the system tray should be.

.A Popup Notification
image::PopUpScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

Take note that that following commands are UI-related commands, and are thus unaffected by the `undo` and `redo` commands (For more information, see <<Undo-Redo>>).

==== Switch notifications on

Command Format: +
`*notif_on*`

{empty} +

{empty} +

=== Undo-Redo
The following commands allow you to undo and redo previously input commands.

The below commands will only affect state-changing, and not UI-related commands. The commands that will be affected are as follows:

* *add_event*
* *delete_event*
* *edit_event*
* *add_task*
* *delete_task*
* *edit_task*
* *import*
* *export*


==== Undo

.Undo Command
image::UndoCommandScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

The `undo` command undoes the previous command. +
Commands can be undone up to the program's launch.

Command Format: +
`*undo*`

{empty} +

==== Redo

.Redo Command
image::RedoCommandScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

The `redo` command redoes a previously undone command.
The `redo` command is able to redo any undone commands that have not been succeeded by a separate state-changing command (e.g. add_event, delete_event, edit).

For example, suppose you added an event `"Attend Horo's Birthday"` and ran the `undo` command, thus removing the event from Horo.
Now, if you run `redo`, the previous state of Horo before the latest `undo` command was executed will be restored;
`"Attend Horo's Birthday"` will once again appear in Horo.

However, if you had executed any state-changing command (except for `undo` or `redo`) just after undoing the `add_event` command,
calling redo will then amount to no effect.

If you've ever used another application with undo-redo functionality, just imagine that Horo's undo-redo functions are as intuitive as theirs.

Command Format: +
`*redo*`

{empty} +

// tag::ics[]
=== iCalendar (ICS) Integration

Horo stores data in the ICS format. Files saved in this format have the extension `.ics`.
This allows for data to be imported from and exported to other calendar applications that also use the `.ics` format.

This means you can export and import your calendar events and todo items straight from Google Calendar into Horo,
and vice versa!
It also means that you can export and import your save data between different machines running Horo.

==== Export Current Data

.Export Command
image::ExportCommandScreenShot.png[]

.Exported File
image::ExportFileScreenShot.png[]

The `export` command exports your current calendar as an ICS file to the specified directory.
If no directory is specified, the file will be created in the same directory as Horo.

If you want to export the ICS file to a certain directory like your desktop,
all you have to do is specify it with the `*--directory*` parameter.

Command Format: +
`*export*` +
`*export* *--directory* DIRECTORY`

Example: +
`*export* *--directory* "C:\Users\USER_NAME\Desktop\Horo"`

{empty} +

==== Import other ICS Data

.Imported File
image::ImportFileScreenShot.png[]

.Import Command
image::ImportCommandScreenShot.png[]

The `import` command imports an ICS file from the specified filepath.

Command Format: +
`*import* FILEPATH`

Example: +
`*import* "C:\Users\USER_NAME\Desktop\OtherCalendars\Others.ics"`
// end::ics[]

{empty} +

=== Exiting the program

Exits the program.

Command Format: +
`*exit*`

{empty} +

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with Horo's save file.
