    "description": "The copyright laws of Singapore and the United have in common a general, flexible, open exception designated by the term 'fair use.' During the last 25 years, the U.S has had extensive experience with this concept, both in the courts and in fields of practice as diverse as art, filmmaking, education, technology, and journalism. Not only have judicial opinions about fair used cohered into a 'unified field theory' of the doctrine, but awareness of its potential applications has increased dramatically among members of relevant communities. The last development has been attributable in part to the development of community-specific Codes of Best Practices for the responsible application of fair use \u2013 an effort in which the instructor for this module has been active. The course will explore the legal background of fair use, its doctrinal evolution over the past 25 years, and a variety of practical situations in which it has been successful employed.",
