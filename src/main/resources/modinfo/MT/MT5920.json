    "description": "Enterprises need to keep innovating to stay competitive - this can be through new applications for existing technologies, or through the discovery and realization of new products/services for new markets. The process of identifying and qualifying opportunities requires an understanding of the business in terms of focus & constraints within, as well as the external market forces to result in value creation. This module will introduce students to the process of value creation - finding a new relevant market for existing technologies or company competency \u2013 in a corporate setting. The method of teaching follows Experiential Learning as student teams will experience the innovation process through close interaction with existing enterprises that are providing real-life problem statements.
