== Introduction

Mark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing
bookmarks*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mark
can get your bookmark organisation and note-taking done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Move on to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

=== Installing Mark

Here are a few steps to get you started on Mark: +

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mark.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
// TODO: move this part to <<Using Mark>>
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all bookmarks
* *`folder Tutorials`* : create a folder named `Tutorials`
* *`add u/https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 n/Pro Git f/Tutorials`* : adds a bookmark
named `Pro Git` to Mark.
* *`delete 3`* : deletes the 3rd bookmark shown in the current bookmark list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mark

Here is an overview of Mark's layout.

There are three main areas in Mark:

. A __command box__ at the top of the screen
. A __bookmark list__ on the left of the screen
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the right side of the screen

// TODO: describe properly (this is very 'functional' but may not be user-friendly)
The __command box__ is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the result display box, immediately below the command box.

.Command box and result display box

The __bookmark list__ shows details about the bookmarks in Mark.

.Bookmark list
image::ui-screenshots/BookmarkList.png[]

The __main viewing area__ shows one of three available tabs at any point in time.
Mark has three [[Tabs]] tabs: **Dashboard**, **Online** and **Offline**.

* The **Dashboard** tab contains information about reminders, favorite bookmarks,
folders, and autotags in Mark.
+

[[Features]]
== Features

This section describes the main features of Mark and how to use them.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
E.g. In the command format `*add* u/URL`, `URL` is a parameter which can be used as `*add* u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
E.g `u/URL [t/TAG]` can be used as
`u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg t/NUS` or as `u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Default values for optional items are specified with an `=` symbol. +
E.g. When `u/URL [t/TAG=CS2103T]` is specified in the command format, the default value for the tag is `CS2103T` if not
it is not provided.
* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. +
E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/module`,
`t/module t/read-later` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
E.g. if the command specifies `u/URL n/NAME`, `n/NAME u/URL` is also acceptable.

[[exporting-bookmarks]]
==== Exporting bookmarks: *`export`*

This command exports Mark data to a specified file on the hard disk. The saved file is
identical in format to the data file `mark.json` and can be used to save back-up copies
of Mark data.

Note that Mark data are automatically saved in the hard disk after any command
that changes the data, so if you do not need outdated Mark data, there is no need to
save manually.

Format: `*export* [FILENAME]`

****
* {blank}
+
`FILENAME` should not include the file extension. E.g. `myBookmarks` and not
`myBookmarks.json`
* `FILENAME` should consist of only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and/or underscores.

structure is different). If no such folder is found, the bookmark will be imported
into the folder `ImportedBookmarks`.

Bookmarks with the same name or URL as existing bookmarks are not imported.

Format: `*import* FILENAME`

=== Folders

The following commands carry out operations on folders in Mark.

==== Expanding the folder hierarchy: *`expand`*

Expands the folder hierarchy by the specified number of levels.

Format: `*expand* [LEVEL=1]`

****
* `LEVEL` should be a positive integer.
* If `LEVEL` is higher than the maximum possible level of folders to expand, it will simply expand all of them.

=== Autotags

The following commands carry out autotag-related operations in Mark.

// tag::autotagcommand[]
[[Autotag-Command]]
==== Creating an automatic tag: *`autotag`*

This command creates a tag that will be automatically applied to bookmarks which match
the given conditions.

Format: `*autotag* TAG_NAME [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [u/URL_KEYWORD]... [f/FOLDER]...
[nn/NOT_NAME_KEYWORD]... [nu/NOT_URL_KEYWORD]... [nf/NOT_FOLDER]...`

****
* `TAG_NAME` should be a valid tag name. No existing autotag should have this tag name.
* At least one condition (`n/`, `nn/`, `u/`, `nu/`, `f/`, or `nf/`) must be specified.
* `NAME_KEYWORD` and `URL_KEYWORD` are used to match bookmarks in a similar way
as the keywords in `*find*` (see <<finding-bookmarks>>). The only difference is that a single
keyword parameter can contain multiple words. E.g. `n/Module W` will match names `CS2103T Module Website` and
`module work to do` but not `Future modules`.
* `FOLDER` should be the exact name of a folder (case insensitive). E.g. `wiki` will match
`Wiki` but not `Wikipedia`.
* `NOT_NAME_KEYWORD`, `NOT_URL_KEYWORD`, and `NOT_FOLDER` are name keywords,
URL keywords, or folder names that bookmarks to be tagged should *not* match.
* The tag `TAG_NAME` is still a normal tag. E.g. if an autotag `YouTube` matches
bookmarks with URLs containing `youtube.com`, other bookmarks can still be
tagged with the tag `YouTube`.

* If multiple conditions are specified, bookmarks are matched in the following way:
    ** For normal conditions (`n/`, `u/`, and `f/`), bookmarks that match at least one condition
    within the same condition type are matched (i.e. OR search). E.g. `n/wiki n/comput` will match
    names `WikiHow` and `Computer Science`.
    ** For negative conditions (`nn/`, `nu/`, and `nf/`), bookmarks that match all of the conditions
    within the same condition type are matched (i.e. AND search). E.g. `nf/Work nf/School` will
    match bookmarks that are not in the folder `Work` and not in the folder `School`.
    ** Bookmarks that match all conditions across different condition types are matched. E.g. `n/web
    n/mod f/NUS` will match bookmarks with [names that match `web` and/or `mod`] AND [are in the
    folder `NUS`].
* Note that no bookmarks will be tagged if conditions contradict each other.
E.g. `u/github.com/mark nu/github.com/`
****

Examples:

// TODO: add step-by-step screenshots of examples
* `*autotag* NUS n/NUS n/School n/Uni` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `NUS` to all bookmarks that have names containing
the keywords `NUS`, `School`, and/or `Uni`.

* `*autotag* LumiNUS u/luminus.nus.edu.sg nf/Miscellaneous` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `LumiNUS` to all bookmarks with URLs
containing `luminus.nus.edu.sg` that are not in the folder `Miscellaneous`.

* `*autotag* Quiz f/NUS f/Module nu/github nu/stackoverflow` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `Quiz` to all bookmarks that are either in
 the folder `NUS` or in the folder `Module`, and that do not contain any of the
keywords `github` or `stackoverflow` in their URLs.
// end::autotagcommand[]

==== Deleting an automatic tag: *`autotag-delete`*

This command deletes a previously created <<autotag, autotag>> from Mark. Tags that are already present will
not be removed, but no bookmarks will be tagged by this autotag after it is deleted.

Format: `*autotag-delete* TAG_NAME`

****
* `TAG_NAME` should be the name of the autotag to be deleted, which is the same
as the name of the tag which it applies. E.g. an autotag that adds the tag
`ProgrammingHelp` to bookmarks is also named `ProgrammingHelp`.
****

Example:

* `*autotag-delete* Quiz` +
 Deletes the autotag that would have tagged bookmarks that match its conditions
with the tag `Quiz`. No existing tags are removed, but new and edited bookmarks
will no longer be automatically tagged with `Quiz`.


=== Offline Copies

The following commands carry out operations relating to <<offline-copy, offline copies>>
of bookmarked web pages.

==== Saving an offline copy: *`cache`*

Saves the bookmarked website locally for offline viewing.

Format: `*cache* INDEX`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to save an offline copy of. If there is a previous version, it will be overwritten.
****

Examples:

* `*cache* 1` +
Saves an offline copy of the first bookmark.

==== Deleting an offline copy: *`cache-delete`*

Deletes an offline copy of a bookmark.

Format: `*cache-delete* INDEX`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to delete the offline copy of. It must have an offline copy to delete.
****

Examples:

* `*cache-delete* 2` +
Deletes the offline copy of the second bookmark.

==== Viewing an offline copy: *`offline`*

If you want to view the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `offline` command. Your view will be switched
to the offline tab where the offline copy is shown.

Format: `*offline* INDEX`
//TODO: [v/VERSION = current]`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to view notes of
//TODO: * `VERSION` is the version of the cached version to show. Default is the current version
****

Examples:

* `*offline* 1` +
Shows annotated offline copy of bookmark 1.

//TODO: * `*offline* 1 v/2` +
//Shows the 2nd version of offline copy of bookmark 1. If it is annotated,
//then annotations are shown as well.


[[annotate]]
==== Making annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate`*

If you want to add a new annotation on the offline copy of a bookmark,
you can do so using the `annotate` command.
With this command, you can highlight a paragraph on the offline document and
optionally attach a supplementary note to said paragraph. You can add notes
to justify the highlight or as content-relevant notes to refer to in future.

If you are looking to add a general note not pertaining to any specific paragraph, you
can also use this command to add it to the bottom of the page, hereby known as the _General notes section_.

Upon annotating, the your view will be switched to the offline tab
showing the results of your command.

NOTE: A general note is not attached to any paragraph of the original web page. Instead, when adding general notes, they are attached
to newly created paragraphs that do not have any content displayed.
General notes are found at the bottom of the page, referred to as the _General notes section_.

You can choose to use this command to overwrite any existing note. However, note that when you use this command to highlight
the paragraph of a general note, Mark remembers the hidden highlight colour, but no highlight is reflected on the application.

NOTE: Paragraphs are identified using a numbered identifier that starts with either `P` or `G`. You can refer to the
numbered identifier in the leftmost column of the offline document to check out the respective identifier for each paragraph.
Paragraphs of general notes are identified using numbered identifiers that begin with `G`, as opposed to paragraphs originating from the original web page, whose identifiers begin with `P`.

Format: `*annotate* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR=yellow]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate* 1 p/p2 n/summary of paragraph h/orange` into the command box.

image::AddAnnotationCommandUi1.png[]
// offline tab, showing result after   annotate 1 p/p2

* Observe that any pre-existing annotation is overwritten. Paragraph P2 is now highlighted orange and a note with content “summary of paragraph” is attached to it.

image::AddAnnotationCommandUi2.png[]
// offline tab, showing result.


// More details about command constraints
****
 * `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to be marked.
 `PARA_NUM` must be `NULL` or it must begin with `P` or `G` (e.g. `P3`). `PARA_NUM` is case-insensitive.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `NOTES` is the content of notes to add.
 * `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. If no colour is specified,
the colour is set to yellow by default.
If the colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

//TODO: remove all the description of result and replace with GUI image?
Other examples:

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2` +
This highlights paragraph P2 yellow in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2 h/pink` +
This overwrites any existing highlight of paragraph P2 with pink
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Any notes attached remain attached.

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2 n/change or add note content` +
This overwrites any note attached to paragraph P2 to a note with content “change or add note content”
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Highlight
colour remains the same. Otherwise, paragraph P2 will be highlighted yellow and
a new note with content "change or add note content" will be added to the paragraph.

* `*annotate* 1 p/null n/adding a general note` +
This adds a note with content "adding a general note" to the _General notes section_ in the
offline copy of bookmark 1.

[[annotate-edit]]
==== Modifying annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-edit`*

If you want to modify existing annotations on the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `annotate-edit` command.
You can choose to overwrite the existing note of a particular paragraph with another note, change the highlight or
choose to move notes from a paragraph to another paragraph. You can also use this command to move a general note to the main text by specifying which original paragraph to move it to.

NOTE: While both `*annotate-edit*` and `*annotate*` can be used to change current annotation highlight and notes, `*annotate-edit*`
allows you to shift your annotations from one paragraph to another in a single step.

Moving of notes to the <<stray-notes, _General notes section_>> is not supported. If you really want to shift them,
use <<annotatedelete, `*annotate-delete*`>> with  `n/true` as the only optional flag you include.

Upon editing an annotation, your view will be switched to the offline tab showing the results of your command.

Format: `*annotate-edit* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [to/NEW_PARA_NUM] [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate-edit* 1 p/g1 to/p1 h/green` into the command box.

==== Deleting annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-delete`*

If you want to delete highlights or notes from the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `annotate-delete` command.
You can choose to remove just the notes and/or highlight of a paragraph, or clear all annotations
on the offline copy to revert it to a clean slate. You can also choose to remove a note from the
<<stray-notes,_General notes section_>>.

If the given paragraph does not have any annotations to remove, nothing is performed.
Also, you cannot choose to remove only the highlight from the paragraph of a general note since it does not display a highlight in the first place.

Upon deleting an annotation, your view will be switched to the offline tab showing the results of your command.

Format: `*annotate-delete* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/KEEP_NOTES=false] [h/KEEP_HIGHLIGHT=false]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2 n/true` into the command box.

image::DeleteAnnotationCommandUi1.png[]
// offline tab, after   annotate 1 p/p2 h/pink n/this note is originally not general

* Observe that the highlight of paragraph P2 if removed and the note is moved to the _General notes section_.

image::DeleteAnnotationCommandUi2.png[]


****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to remove annotations of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to remove annotation(s) from. `PARA_NUM` must be either `all` or begin with `P` or `S`.
 If you entered `all` for this parameter, all annotations will be cleared regardless of other options, reverting the offline document to a clean slate.
 If you specified a phantom paragraph instead, the phantom paragraph will be deleted if `n/KEEP_NOTES` parameter is set to `false`.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or there is no annotation to delete, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_NOTES` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the notes of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the notes will be removed. `KEEP_NOTES` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_NOTES` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the highlight of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the highlight will be removed. `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT`` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Other examples:

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2` +
This removes both the note and highlight from paragraph P2 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.
