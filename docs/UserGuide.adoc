== Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide for Modulo!

Modulo is an all-in-one student life application which is mainly targeted to NUS students. The app features four different functions which consists of weekly organizer, financial record system, quiz revision, and grades tracker.

Those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) might find using Modulo to be more straightforward than the usual Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. The application has the visual benefits of a GUI but stands strongly rooted in command line usage. Modulo does not require an internet connection to run so there’s no worry when the school wifi goes MIA yet again. The only time you need to be connected is at the start, when downloading the application. Look to <<Quick Start>> to find out how to get started on Modulo!

The enhanced search is case insensitive and matches any keyword in the module code or description e.g. `cs1010s` matches `CS1010S`

The search method adopts the inclusive OR search method that returns any modules with the keyword.
e.g. searching for `prog metho` will return `Programming Methodology I` and `Programming Methodology II`.

Format: `find KEYWORD`
e.g. `find CS1010S`, `find Programming`

==== Clear all modules the record : `clear`
Deletes all modules in the record. The user can avoid clearing modules one-by-one when large number of modules have to be cleared.
When the single keyword `clear` is entered, Modulo would recognise it as a command to clear all the modules. The action is irreversible!

==== Add an entry of expenditure: `spend`

Record down an entry of spending with relevant information associated with it. If place of spending is not specified, it will default to `-`.

Format: `*spend* <amt>AMOUNT <item>DESCRIPTION <met>TRANSACTION_METHOD [<place>PLACE] [<day>TRANSACTION_DATE] [<cat>CATEGORY]...` +

==== Mark a Borrow or Lend entry as repaid: `repaid`

Indicate that borrowed money or money lent has been returned. Note that index of log entry in list has to be of type 'borrow' or 'lend' to be successfully marked as repaid, all other log entries (i.e. 'spend', 'income') will be considered invalid. +
Once the log entry has been marked as repaid, it cannot be undone and it is no longer editable.

Any irrelevant fields to the log entry (e.g. 'Borrow' entries do not have a `<place>` field) will be ignored. +

Note that the newly-entered information will overwrite the details at the attribute. For example, if there were categories `food` and `hobby` linked to the entry at index 5 of the list, command `edit 5 <cat>pet` will delete the previous two categories and replace them with a single category `pet.` +

Repaid 'Borrow' and 'Lend' entries cannot be edited.

Note that only item description will allow for partial word matching (i.e. `cook` in `cookie` is valid), the rest will search for a full word match. This search is case-insensitive.

Filter the list of log entries by their log entry type (i.e. spend, income, borrow, lend).

At least one field has to be specified.

To return to the default full list of log entries, use the `list` command.

Format: `*find* [<type> spend/income/borrow/lend] [<keyword> KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...] [<cat> CATEGORY_NAME [MORE_CATEGORY_NAMES]...]` +
E.g. `find <type>spend`

==== Show statistical summaries of finances: `stats`

Shows an overview of the state of expenses and incomes. Log entries can be grouped by (`<gb>`) a specified attribute with either the frequency or total amount of each group summarised (`<sum>`) in a graphical display. These attributes include log entries of the same month, type, transaction method, category or place.

Both `<gb>` and `<sum>` have to be present, with combination of `ATTRIBUTE` and `STAT` specified.

Format: `*stats* <gb>ATTRIBUTE <sum>STAT` +
* Possible `ATTRIBUTE` values for `<gb>` are: `month`, `entrytype`, `met`, `cat`, `place` (only shows `Spend` entries) +
* Possible `STAT` values for `<sum>` are: `freq` and `amt` +
E.g. `stats <gb> met <sum> freq`

==== Add a budget: `budget`

Specify a budget. Budgets will only take into account the amount spent (i.e. `Spend` entries) and are generally characterised by a starting date, an ending date and a limit (maximum threshold). When total amount associated with spending crosses this limit, the budget is considered to be exceeded.

Budgets for a specific place, category or transaction method can also be set (optional). Only at most one field out of these 3 optional fields - `<met>`, `<cat>`, `<place>` - can be included to make the budget more specific. If a spend entry matches the specified field and also falls within the budget duration, it will be included in the budget tabulation. If none of these fields are indicated, the budget will sum up the amounts of *all* `Spend` entries which fall between the budget duration.

In essence, there are 3 optional fields (only at most one can be used at any time):

1. `[<met>TRANSACTION_METHOD]`
2. `[<cat>CATEGORY_NAME]`
3. `[<place>PLACE_OF_SPENDING]`

Note that these fields are case-sensitive (e.g. `Spend` entries with category `food` will not match if budget field is specified as `<cat> FOOD`).

There are 3 ways to specify the duration (start, end) of a budget:

1. <start>START_DATE <end>END_DATE
2. <start>START_DATE <dur>DURATION_IN_DAYS
3. <month>MM-YYYY

Example Format 1: `*budget* <amt>AMOUNT <start>START_DATE <end>END_DATE [<met>TRANSACTION_METHOD]` +
Example Format 2: `*budget* <amt>AMOUNT <start>START_DATE <dur>DURATION_IN_DAYS [<cat>CATEGORY_NAME]` +
Example Format 3: `*budget* <amt>AMOUNT <month>MM-YYYY [<place>PLACE_OF_SPENDING]` +
e.g. `budget <amt> 300 <month>11-2019 <met>cash`
