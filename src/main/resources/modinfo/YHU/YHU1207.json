    "description": "In this course, students will write creative responses to visual art, and read examples of ekphrasis (as it\u2019s known) by poets, fiction writers, and essayists. The class will take a field trip to the Singapore Art Museum to write flash fiction, lyric essays, and/or poems in response to a particular piece of art, and we\u2019ll be writing a number of creative works in response to photographs, sometimes familiar family photos and sometimes photos by wellknown photographers. The final project will pair students as both photographers and word artists, responding to the visual work of their classmates in a class exhibit.",
