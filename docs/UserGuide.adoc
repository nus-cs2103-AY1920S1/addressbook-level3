== Welcome to AddMin+

*AddMin+* is an all-in-one administration desktop application, that is specially designed for any events management start-up company with limited manpower and resources.
These companies would usually only be able to afford to hire one admin staff to handle both the management of events and employees and this can be tough.
The Admin+ Team understands the struggles that start-ups face daily, and we are here to help!

*AddMin+* is specially designed to ease the workload of the admin and allow him/her to effectively handle the administrative tasks of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and deletion, editing of event details after creation, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an overview of all the data via statistics.
The purpose of this user guide is to show the user how they can use our app to carry out their administrative tasks efficiently and also answer any questions they may have while using our app.

== Getting Started

=== Installation

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `AddMin+.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to a *new empty folder* which you want to use as the home folder for AddMin+
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

=== CLI Usage & Command Formatting

*Command Format*

As a CLI application, most commands are executed by typing your commands on the Command Box.
We will discuss the exact commands that you may execute under the <<Features>> section, but it is important to first understand the format of the command.

Commands start with a single string (which may include underscores) such as `add_em` or `free`.
Subsequently, you supply the prefix, for example, `n/` and then the necessary parameter.
It is alright if there is spacing within your parameter.
The prefixes and parameters will be stated for each command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the *compulsory* parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add_em n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_em n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are *optional* e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME no/PHONE_NUMBER`, `no/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Previous commands can be accessed by using the *up/down arrow keys*.
* Not following the specific format will trigger an _Invalid Command Format_ error message on the result display box.

[[Constraints]]

[[Features]]
== Features

====
The features of AddMin+ can be grouped into 4 main categories, General, Entity Management, Finance, Schedule, and Statistics.
The commands that AddMin+ recognize follows a specific format, however, each category will have their own set of valid commands.
For new users, do refer to the subsections under Section 3 for the specific command and how to use them.

[[set_ev_dt]]
==== Setting a Date&Time to an Event: `set_ev_dt`

Sets a Date-Time Schedule Mapping for a specific Event.

[NOTE]
Even though the start date and end dates of each event is stated, the event is not assumed to be held for the entire range.
Hence, the Date-Time setting feature enables the user to _declare and set_ the schedule of the event.
Events are initialized without any schedule, other than their stated start and end date with a default time of __0800-1800__.

Format: `set_ev_dt EVENT_INDEX [on/EVENT_DATE] [till/EVENT_DATE] time/EVENT_DAYTIME`

****
* Note the <<Constraints>> for *INDEX*, *DATE*, and *TIME PERIOD*.
* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are *not used*, then all dates inclusive of the start to end date of the target event will be set with the stated `EVENT_DAYTIME`.
* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are used, then the date range (inclusive) from the start to end date stated will be set with the stated `EVENT_DAYTIME`.
* If *only* the `on/` prefix is used, it will just set the `EVENT_DAYTIME` for the __single__ stated `EVENT_DATE`.
* The `till/` prefix must be used with the `on/` prefix, and not by itself.
* All `EVENT_DATE` *must be within the range of the Target Event's Start and End Date*
* The `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `on/` prefix cannot be after the `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `till/` prefix
****

Examples:

* `set_ev_dt 2 on/02/10/2019 time/1000-2000` +
Sets the 2nd Event from the Event List a time period of 10am-8pm on the 2nd of October 2019.

* All `EVENT_DATE` *must be within the range of the Target Event's Start and End Date*
* The `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `on/` prefix cannot be after the `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `till/` prefix
****

Example:

* `delete_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019` +
Deletes the Date-Time mapping on 18th October from the 2nd Event on the Event list.

* `delete_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019 till/22/10/2019` +

* If the VALUE is larger than the money pending to pay, the payment would not be generated.
* If the employee who has been paid for a past event has been removed from the allocation of a past event,
the "Pending To Pay" value may become negative. You will not be able to pay an employee whose current pending pay is negative,
until the 'undo_pay' command is executed to reset the pending payment value to more than or equal to  0.
****

Examples:

* `list_em` +
`pay 3 s/50` +
Generates the payment of employee with $50.

=== Schedule Management

Welcome to Schedule!
Looking for a way to display and see what events you have on a specific Date or Month?
Want to have an overview of all the dates where you have an event?
Then you are at the right place!

To get things started, all Schedule-related commands occur in the Schedule Tab as seen from the figure below.
You can get to the Schedule Tab easily by either clicking on the Schedule Tab on the User Interface or just simply type in any Schedule-related commands and AddMin+ will bring you there.

[NOTE]
====
- All Event-Related commands that are done in the Schedule Tab, will be referencing the Event List displayed in the Schedule Tab.
- All Employee-Related commands are disabled in the Schedule Tab, as there is no Employee List being displayed in the Schedule Tab.
====

._User Interface (UI) of the Schedule Feature_
image::ScheduleUiDetailed.png[]

---

==== Display Schedule for a specific date: `display_schedule_date`

Want to check if you have any events on a specific date?
Instead of looking through the entire list of events you have, you could use the `display_schedule_date` command to do it!

Format: `display_schedule_date on/dd/MM/yyyy`

Examples:
`display_schedule_date on/02/12/2019`

****
* Note the <<Constraints>> for *DATE*.
****

**Example: To display schedule for a specific date (20/11/2019):**

**Step 1**.
Either type `display_schedule_date on/20/11/2019` into the command box or click on the specific date from the date picker as seen from the figure below.

image::ScheduleUiStep1.png[]

**Step 2**.
The result box will display a message informing you how many events are being listed.
In this case, the message displayed is "1 event listed!"

image::ScheduleUiStep2.png[]

**Step 3**.
In the event list, you will be able to see all the events that are on the specified date.
In this case, the only event that is on 20/11/2019 is "Talk by DEF Company".

image::ScheduleUiStep3.png[]

[NOTE]
====
- The event list will be empty and not display anything if there is no event on the specified date.
- The command is designed to give an overview of the user's schedule and is based on the event's Start and End date.

**Step 2**.
Generate the statistics either by using the mouse to click the generate statistics button or by typing `generate_stats` command.

image::StatsUiPart1.png[]

**Step 3**.
Statistics will be displayed in 2 different types of views: list and pie chart.
The list will display the upcoming events that require manpower sorted from the nearest upcoming date to the furthest date.
The pie charts represent the upcoming events that require manpower and employees tags respectively. This is done this way to help the user identify efficiently if they have sufficient employees with matching tags for the event or if more employees may need to be hired to match the tag of the upcoming event.
For example, a music event will have a 'music' tag and an employee who plays the guitar will have a 'musician' tag.
The pie charts will reflect that there is one event under the 'music' tag and one employee under the 'musician' tag.

image::StatsUiPart2.png[]

**Step 4**.
To allocate an employee to an upcoming event, double-click the event on the list and it will display the allocate function covered earlier in the User Guide.
The segments on the pie charts can also be clicked to display the number of events or employees associated with that specific tag on the top right corner of each of the pie charts.

Generate statistics manually when any change in data occurs to keep the statistics up to date and relevant.
