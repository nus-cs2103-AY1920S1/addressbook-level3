    "description": "This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing. Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include: functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.",
