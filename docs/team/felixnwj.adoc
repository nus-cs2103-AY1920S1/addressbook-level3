== PROJECT: CaloFit

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic desktop addressbook application(AddressBook - Level 3) for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph
it into a calorie tracker cum food database system called CaloFit. This enhanced application allows health-conscious people or those who are aiming for a diet to set their calorie budget for the day; manage the meals that they take; find dishes based on keywords or their remaining calorie budget; and get data about their calorie intake progress through a report.

CaloFit is a desktop application for tracking the calories that the user has taken from his or her meals over the course of using the application. +
The user interacts with CaloFit using a Command Line Interface(CLI) that is represented by a box near the top of the application screen. This is where the user can type in their commands and press "Enter" on their keyboards to execute them. +
It has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX. The GUI is the main display that the user sees upon starting up CaloFit.

This is what our project looks like as shown in Figure 1 below:

My role was to design and write the codes for the `report` feature. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to
the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates important information.

`report` A grey highlight(called a monospace) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

#ReportCommand# A yellow highlight indicates that the text is a Class or Object.

#_Logic#getStatistics()_# A yellow italicised highlight indicates a method call of an Object(method name is indicated after the # symbol).

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to generate a Report*.
** What it does: creates a Report that displays the statistics calculated from the user's meal history for that particualar month.
** Justification: This feature gives purpose to the application as the user should be someone who wants to keep track of their calorie intake. By implementing this feature, the user is able to know their calorie intake for the month, as well as other statistics generated from it, whenever they want.
** Highlights: As virtually any form of statistical data can be generated from a user's meal history, the scope of the data calculated and shown to the user is not exhaustive. The statistics chosen to be calculated are decided based on the user stories and use cases that our team has considered and is linked here.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *automatic saving of the meal history of the user as a JavaScript Objection Notation(JSON) file*.
** What it does: The user's meal entries into CaloFit will be saved into a JSON file, allowing the user's meal history to be loaded upon starting up CaloFit.
** Justification: This small feature is crucial as we need to ensure that the user's meal log is saved in order to track his or her progress since he or she started using CaloFit.
** Credits: The methods and structure of converting a Class into a JSON file was taken from the original AddressBook-Level 3 and refactored for the purpose mentioned above.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=felixnwj&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=FelixNWJ&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Functional code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases *v1.2.1* and *v1.3* (2 releases) on GitHub.
*** Overall project leader, scheduled meeting timings and summarised each meeting afterwards for dissemination to group members.
** Community:
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (https://github.com/FelixNWJ/ped/issues[List of bugs reported])
** Tools:
*** Set up *Travis Continuous Integration* for my Individual project and helped the team integrate it into the Team project.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide as we had to update the original AddressBook-Level3 User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added. The following is an excerpt from our *CaloFit User Guide*, showing additions that I have made for the `report` feature. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
