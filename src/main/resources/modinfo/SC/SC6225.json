    "description": "The theorising of kinship relations has always had a central place in anthropological studies. This course will equip students with an understanding of kinship and personhood as essential aspects of human sociality, a knowledge of the key debates in kinship studies, and basic methods for the investigation of kinship and relatedness in field research. Topics covered will include current anthropological approaches to a wider field of \u2018relatedness\u2019 in a globalised world marked by new communicative technologies, voluntaristic friendships, changing family structures, the shifting significance of kin networks, the formation of transnational families, and the development of New Reproductive Technologies.",
