    "description": "This module is about placing students in an active environment or community (Living Lab), providing them with opportunities to conceptualize products or services\nwhich will later be designed and developed in the ECE laboratories. The Living Labs (LL) may be rehabilitation centres in hospitals, orphanages, block of HDB flats,\nhawker centres, etc where good opportunities abound for technology to play a role in overall improvements of such places. Students in this module will spend 3 weeks\nconducting field work, observing and engaging users in the LL, with the objective of conceptualizing products/services which will benefit a large segment of the users. Students will be encouraged to realize their ideas in the other project modules in the curriculum.",
