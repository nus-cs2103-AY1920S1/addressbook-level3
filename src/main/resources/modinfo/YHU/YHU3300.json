    "description": "This course examines the impact of 1917 on European and global history. We will examine the nature and experience of 'total war,' the life of women and children on the 'home front,' and the diplomacy and economics behind the bloodshed of the First World War that marked the end of European hegemony in world politics. The course also examines the Russian Revolution and the Bolsheviks, with a lasting impact on 20th century history. Finally, the course uses the recent anniversary of 1917 to compare and contrast forms of collective memory and memorialization of war and revolution in Europe and beyond.",
