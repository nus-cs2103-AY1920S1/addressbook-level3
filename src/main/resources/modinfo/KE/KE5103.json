    "description": "KE5103-1 Hybrid Architectures & Soft Computing The objective of this module is to teach the use of Hybrid Architectures and Soft Computing in Knowledge engineering. The module reviews KE techniques and matches these to problem types. Other topics include Review of Fuzzy, Neural and GA modeling. Building hybrid systems, typical architectures, and integration issue. This module is compulsory for all KE students. KE5103-2 Hybrid System Workshops The objective of this module is to allow students to use Hybrid KE techniques to carry out a workshop. The module begins by introducing the workshops (which are based on optimization and forecasting), reviewing the available KE software tools and describing the workshop guidelines. After completing the workshop there will be student presentations and assessments. There will be a graded assignment. This module is compulsory for all KE students.",
