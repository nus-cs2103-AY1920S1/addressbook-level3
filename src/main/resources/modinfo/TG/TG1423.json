    "description": "The management portion of the module is to expose engineering students to the theories and applications of management, organizational theory in contemporary organizations from a conceptual, analytical and pragmatic perspective. It will comprise the basic functions of management: planning, organizing, leading and controlling. Integrated into this portion are the issues of ethics, leadership, international management, technological proliferation, cultural diversity, supply chains, operations control and the management of quality and knowledge to allow students to develop their own framework for analyzing and understanding management as well as exploring and developing a personal philosophy of management. Students are also expected to complete a short term paper to reflect this understanding. The analytical portion of the module is intended as an introduction for engineering students to project management techniques. It covers concepts of project organization using work breakdown structure, economic feasibility analysis, planning and scheduling using critical path and PERT methods, finalizing schedules based on resource availability, and monitoring schedule and budget variances. Project management software is introduced with illustrative examples for students to try on their own.",
