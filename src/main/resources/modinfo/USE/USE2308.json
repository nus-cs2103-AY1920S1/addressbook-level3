However, with the increasing ubiquity of Internet technologies and user-generated content, political actors soon took on myriad dimensions and forms. Students will acquire knowledge of foundational communication and political participation theories, as well as critically examine the relationship between media and political processes. The module also inculcates insights and knowledge on how media and politics play out in various arenas, such as political parties and campaigning, civil society organizations and grassroots movements.",
