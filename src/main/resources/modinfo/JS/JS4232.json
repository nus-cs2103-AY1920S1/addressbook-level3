    "description": "Japanese companies have a long history of selling, producing and investing in Asia. Here they worked closely together with local policy makers and businesses, the particular business models and practices of Japanese companies either being regarded as something to learn from or as standing in the way of proper integration into host countries. This module investigates the activities of Japanese companies in Asia from the home country as well as the host country perspectives. Besides looking at the theoretical underpinnings of the international business activities of Japanese companies, students will work on company and country specific case studies.",
