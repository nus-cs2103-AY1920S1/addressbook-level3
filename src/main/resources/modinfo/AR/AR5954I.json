    "description": "What is Landscape? How can we act on/for landscape by implementing design that responds conceptually to a site? By this, we mean a design which ties itself to place, to community, to historical and social issues, and that by doing so constructs a space telling a meaningful narrative and establishing a long lasting bond with site. To answer to the above questions the module unfolds issues which address students towards a critical reading of context, a necessary process for implementing a site-specific design project, and explores with students theory and methodology of conceptual design, focusing and resolving towards space making and aimed at fostering community identity and cohesion. The module focuses on Urban Public Space. Exploring avant-garde artistic movements design tools,it takes the city as a research field to test and verify how art means can define public space and give physical form to the conceptual, and how those tools could and have been transposed into contemporary landscape and urban design.",
