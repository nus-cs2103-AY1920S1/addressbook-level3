== PROJECT: Xpire

== Overview

Xpire is an application that helps users manage their items and track their expiry dates.
With a minimalistic dark mode GUI created with JavaFX, the user can easily use the application via Command Line Interface.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *`ShiftCommand`* that allows the user to transfer items to and fro the replenish list.
** What it does: -	enables the user to transfer an item from the expiry date tracker into the replenish list containing the items to
stock up on, such as when the item expires.
** Justification: - Instead keying in an item's details again, the user simply needs to key in the given
item index to transfer an existing item to the replenish list. This makes the overall user experience more fuss-free.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a refactor of the `Model` component using important concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance.
The implementation was also challenging as it required a in-depth understanding of generics to avoid a huge overhaul of the existing implementation.

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to automatically add an item to the replenish list once the item runs out.
** What it does: -	automatically transfers an item that has depleted into the replenish list.
** Justification: -	Instead of having the user delete an item on the tracking list and add it into the replenish list
manually when it runs out, this enhancement collapses this two-step process into a one-step process.
** Highlights: The implementation required an in-depth analysis of user needs and comprehensive testing to ensure
that edge cases will also be factored in.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability to input item quantity.
The parsing of the quantity field familiarised me with Regex as I had to consider edge cases.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability to input similar items into the tracking list.
This allows the user to add to existing items in cases where they bought the same item on separate occasions.
