    "description": "This course will cover density functional theory and its variants for many-particle systems (electrons in atoms, molecules, solids; ultracold atoms in traps and optical lattices) from the perspective of theoretical and mathematical physics and will also deal with applications and the intricacies of numerical implementations. A central component of the module are the lectures given during the IMS Programme on Density Functionals for Many-Particle Systems (2-27 September 2019).",
