    "description": "Genetic engineering (or genetic modification, transgenic) is to modify genetic materials of living things according to human\u2019s will. Is it beneficial or harmful? Are you aware of GMO (genetically modified organism) and GM food? Do you want to favour or oppose these GM products? Should we modify the gene for curing genetic diseases? Is it acceptable to use genetically modified animals for organ transplantation to human? Do you know that genetic modification can actually help to save the environment? This module will help students to understand the science behind genetic engineering and thus students can make educated answers to the above questions. There are plenty of examples of genetic engineering and each student needs to choose one or few examples and try to understand how these products have been created; their benefits and potential hazards, if any, will be discussed in the class.",
