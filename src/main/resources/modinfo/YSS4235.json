    "description": "How does media enable religious practitioners to experience the divine in\nthe immediacy of the \u201chere and now\u201d? Prayer, liturgy, chanting,\nmeditation, and acts of remembering to commune with higher powers, are\nacts that incorporate audio-visual technologies, t.v., radio, internet,\nreligious texts, art, relics, icons, as well as so-called \u201cidols\u201d and \u201cfetishes.\u201d\nFocusing on the intersection of religion and media, students will analyze\n\u201csensational forms,\u201d and religious conceptions of how to properly\nrepresent the divine (\u201csemiotic theologies\u201d). By examining media use of\nseveral religious communities around the world, the course highlights\ncritical aspects of religious practice and religious difference.",
