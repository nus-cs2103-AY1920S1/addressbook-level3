    "description": "This module explores the deep interconnections between language, cognition and culture. It begins with a consideration of the \u2018discursive mind\u2019 - that is, the particularly human way of knowing that uses language as its primary tool and medium. Realizing how much of human cognition is language-dependant, we then explore the relations between language, cognition and culture by looking at such everyday linguistic phenomena as code-switching, metaphor and gesture. Augmenting the reading of sociolinguistic and cognitive science texts in this module, students will also learn how to collect and to analyze empirical evidence of language phenomena in order to more critically assess the claims of such texts.",
