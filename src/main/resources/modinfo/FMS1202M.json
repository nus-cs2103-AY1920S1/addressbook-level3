    "description": "Mathematics is the best known but least understood subject. It plays a\nfundamental role in the development of science, technology and society but it\nhas received little public recognition and is often misused or wrongly perceived\nas not useful in life. The seminar module will expose students to various views\non the nature of mathematics, the enterprise called mathematics and its role in\nthe development of science, technology and society. The module will also focus\non specific topics or issues in science, technology and society where\nmathematics have significant impact, such the 2007 financial crisis, the internet,\ndigital age, electronic commerce, epidemics and so forth. The topics and issues\nmay be introduced by the lecturer or identified by the students. The students\nmay focus on aspects of a topic that they are most interested in and at a\nmathematical level that they are comfortable with depending on their\nbackground. The mathematics would be elementary and mostly algorithmic and\ndiscrete in the beginning and will move gently up to a level, which may be\ndifferent for different students.",
