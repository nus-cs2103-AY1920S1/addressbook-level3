= Ng Zhao Ming - Project Portfolio


== Introduction

This project portfolio serves to note down my contributions to a team-based software engineering project in the
NUS Computing module, CS2103T. During this module, my team of 5 were given six weeks to either
_morph_ or _enhance_ an existing Java project,
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book - Level 3].

=== Project Motivation

There are certain module requirements that our team have to adhere to when developing our application.

*Constrains:*::

.  Our application has to cater to individuals who can type fast and have a preference for typing over
other forms of input.
. The product has to be https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24409/brownfield[_Brownfield_].

*Our Decision:*::
In order to address these requirements, we have collectively decided to _morph_
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book - Level 3] into a Traveller's Diary, _TravEzy_.
 +

Here is how _Travezy_ will look when you first start it:

Highlights of _TravEzy_: +

. As seen in _Figure 1._, _TravEzy_ utilizes the https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3336/command-line[Command Line Interface (CLI)]
through the _command box_ and in turn, most user
interactions are mediated through commands keyed into _TravEzy_.
. Is a desktop application and can be accessed on the computer without the need of a web browser.

=== About the project - _TravEzy_

_TravEzy_ combines all the essential travelling application and present it as a single package. It is the ideal
all-in-one application to assist globetrotters in planning their schedule, tracking their finances and
relieving their best memories.

_TravEzy_ targets NUS students who loves to backpack across several countries. As a team of 5 NUS student
who have a passion for travel, we believe that we are better to understand and cater to the needs of our target audience.

Given that NUS students are constantly hustling and still love to find time to unwind and travel, _TravEzy_ is ideal
application for them to do so.
In addition, _TravEzy_ will also be useful for students who are embarking on their Semester Exchange Programmes
during their junior and senior years in NUS.

The list below highlights the main features _TravEzy_ has to offer:

. Calendar
. Itinerary
. Financial Tracker
. Address Book
. Diary

=== Overview of my role in _TravEzy_

I was tasked to implement the itinerary feature for TravEzy.
The itinerary helps users to organize their busy schedule through inputting of timed events.

The following sections illustrate these implementations in more detail. Besides that, I will also delve into the contributions
I have made in the documentations of _TravEzy's_ User and Developer guides.

Before we move on, I would like to highlight the symbols and text formatting that will be used in this document,
which aims to improve readability of this document.

[IMPORTANT]
Crucial information that you should take note off while reading the document.


``command``: Text which is contained in a grey box (as can be seen on the left) refers to _commands_ that the user
can type into the _command box_ in order to interact with _TravEzy_

_Components_: Italicised text indicates that the text has a definition that is specific to the application.

*Highlight* Bold text is mainly used for headings

=== Summary of contributions

Here is a summary in order of importance on the contributions that I have made during the team project.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
| Now, I will be sharing the documentation that I have contributed to the User Guide.
It manifests my ability to provide clear and concise instructions for end-users to use _TravEzy_.
I will be focusing on 2 relevant commands which are ``sort`` and ``search``.
|===

=== Searching for an event: ``search``

Does your _event list_ too many events to browse through? Let _TravEzy_ Itinerary help you by searching for events that matches specific
keywords. üòä

[TIP]
If your _event list_ is too cluttered up, try using the ``clear`` command instead to reset the *whole* _event list_ instead.

*Format:*

``search SEARCH CONDITION``

where ``SEARCH CONDITION`` can be any of the following: ``title/TITLE``, ``date/DATE``, ``time/TIME``, ``l/LOCATION``,
``d/DESCRIPTION`` or ``tag/``

*Example:*

    search date/12122019 l/DisneySea

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``search`` in the _command box_ and press _Enter_.

image::ItinerarySearch1.png[width=400]

Step 2. The _result box_ will display the message "Processing...
Done!
Here are the events that matches the details. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)"

Step 3. The filtered _event list_ will be shown containing events that matches the keywords given.

image::ItinerarySearch2.png[width=400]

=== Sorting the events: ``sort``

Organizing your events in the _event list_ has never been easier the Itinerary's awesome sorting capabilities. üíØ

Format:

``sort by/SORT CONDITION``

where ``SORT CONDITION`` can be any of the following: ``title``, ``location``, ``chronological``, ``completion`` or
``priority``

*Example:*

    sort by/priority

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``sort by/priority`` in the _command box_ and press _Enter_.

image::ItinerarySort1.png[width=400]

Step 2. The _result box_ will display the message "Processing...
Done!
TravEzy has helped sorted out your life!"

Step 3. The Itinerary will present the sorted _event list_ based on the sort condition given.

=== Itinerary

The itinerary feature in TravEzy allows users to organize their events and view these events in one convenient _Event List_.

Current, the itinerary feature supports the basic commands of add, delete, edit and marking your events as done.
In addition, it also includes other more advanced commands such as search and sort to better organize your events.
With these implementations, _TravEzy_ aims to be at the frontier of convenience.

The itinerary feature implements the aforementioned feature based on the use cases below:

.Use Case Diagram of the Itinerary feature
image::ItineraryUseCaseDiagram.png[width=400]

Due to the numerous features supported by the itinerary, it requires a complex structure to ensure that each input
by the user are cautiously parsed before giving the appropriate command result.

.Architecture Diagram of the Itinerary feature
image::ItineraryDiagram.png[width=400]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the itinerary feature.
Inputs given by the user are channeled from the text UI and parsed in the logic package before different commands
are formed which generates the model and updates the itinerary object which contains the event list.

The `text UI`, `logic manager` and `storage manager` all stem from the common package of the main TravEzy application.
However, in the `parser` package of itinerary, it contains various parser objects for the different command.
This is to ensure that each command in the itinerary have only one parser validating the command.

==== Model Component

The implementation of the model class in TravEzy is to be a generic. Hence, the model object being instantiated
could be any of the following 5 features, `Calendar`, `Itinerary`, `Financial Tracker`, `Travel Diary`
and `Achievements`. Below is the model class diagram for the itinerary feature:

.Model Diagram of the Itinerary feature
image::ItineraryModelDiagram.png[width=400]

The Model, is the crux of the itinerary feature which serves several functions this include:

* stores the Itinerary data which includes the event list which keeps track of all the events that are
included by the user and stores it into the storage in a JSON file.

* exposes an unmodifiable ObservableList<Event> that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* does not depend on any of the other three components, UI, logic and storage which are common through all the features
throughout TravEzy.

==== Itinerary search command

The search command for specified events in the event list is facilitated by the `Itinerary` class which contains
an event list and keep track of the events that the user has inputted into TravEzy. There are several search conditions
available for the users to search from based on the different class attributes that form the `Event` class:

* search title/[title]
* search date/[date]
* search time/[time]
* search l/[location]
* search d/[description]

Given below is the _sequence diagram_ of how the Itinerary feature interacts with TravEzy when the search command is
being called.

.Sequence Diagram of the Search Command
image::ItinerarySearchCommand.png[width=400]

[IMPORTANT]
The lifeline for SearchCommandParser and SearchEventDescriptor should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The search command is implement as follows, upon giving the command by the user in the text UI, the command
will be channeled to the `Logic` class where it identifies it as a itinerary command and passes it to the `ItineraryParser`
class.

The `Itinerary Parser` passes through the command into a switch case block and identifies this as a `SearchCommand`.
This will create a new `SearchCommandParser` which will then accept the arguments from the user's input and parse the
arguments of the command.

Once the arguments are parsed and considered as valid, the `SearchCommandParser` will generate a new `SearchCommand`.
The `SearchCommand` will in turn create a "pseudo-event" known as the `SearchEventDescriptor` which is an event
which only contains attributes with the search condition while the rest of it's attribute will be placed as null.

This `SearchEventDescriptor` will in turn be returned and used in the `Predicate` field as the event in comparison.
The `filterEvents(e)` method will be called with `e` being the `SearchEventDescriptor` that is being generated. Events
that are currently in the event list will be filtered accordingly based on whether it matches the attributes in the
`SearchEventDescriptor`. Finally, the `filteredList` will be generated and returned.
