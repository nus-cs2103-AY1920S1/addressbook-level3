== Introduction

AlgoBase (AB) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing algorithm problems. AlgoBase can let you establish and modify your own training plan for algorithm problems flexibly and it can save several training plans at the same time on your local storage!  Also, you can use diverse tags and search to manage your questions and training plans conveniently. More importantly, AlgoBase is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ALgoBase can get your problem management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy! :-))

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `algobase.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AlgoBase application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all problems
* **`add`**`n/factorial m/define a function factorial that takes in a number and n and returns the factorial of the number t/recursion a/Wee Han` : adds a problem called 'factorial' tagged with 'recursion' and authored by 'Wee Han'
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/factorial t/recursion` or as `n/factorial`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/recursion`, `t/recursion t/dynamic-programming` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a problem: `add`

Generates a new problem. +
Format: `add n/NAME [m/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add  n/factorial m/define a function factorial that takes in a number n and returns the factorial of the number t/recursion a/Wee Han`

=== Listing all problems : `list`

Displays a list of all existing problems. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a problem : `edit`

Edits an existing problem. +
Format: `edit n/NAME [d/DELETE] [n/NAME] [m/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR]  [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 a/John Doe +
Edits the author of the 1st problem to be `John Doe` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/permutations t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd problem to be `permutations` and clears all existing tags.

=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find factorial` +
Returns `factorial` and `Factorialize`
* `find factorial permutations` +
Returns any problem having names `factorial`, or `permutations`

// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting a problem : `delete`

Deletes an existing problem. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the problem at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd problem in the displayed list.
* `find n/factorial` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st problem in the results of the `find` command.

// end::delete[]
=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from AlgoBase. +
Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

AlgoBase data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AlgoBase folder.

== Command Summary

* *Add* `add n/NAME [m/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR] [t/TAG]...` +
e.g. `add  n/factorial m/define a function factorial that takes in a number n and returns the factorial of the number t/recursion a/Wee Han`
* *Clear* : `clear`
* *Delete* : `delete INDEX` +
e.g. `delete 3`
* *Edit* : `edit n/NAME [d/DELETE] [n/NAME] [m/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR]  [t/TAG]...` +
e.g. `edit 2 n/permutations t/`
* *Find* : `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +
e.g. `find factorial permutations`
* *List* : `list`
* *Help* : `help`
