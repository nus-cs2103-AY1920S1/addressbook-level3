== PROJECT: Typee

== Overview

*_Typee_* is a desktop engagement management application. It has a GUI created with JavaFX, but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
It is an appointment manager for secretaries and receptionists to better schedule and manage appointments. *_Typee_* comes with a dynamic parsing input structure and productivity enhancing features like graphical calendar view,
conflict checker, sorting and undo/redo. All data required is stored locally, and Internet connection is not necessary for full functionality. +
*_Typee_* is written in Java and contains around 17kLoC.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to enhance functionality by designing and implementing new features to the program. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

TIP: This symbol indicates useful information for users to utilise *_Typee_*.

NOTE: This symbol indicates additional or important information.

`undo` : A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below is a brief summary of my contribution to the project._
|===

=== *Major enhancement*:
* Added the ability to *undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command. The undo/redo feature supports operations that modify the engagement list, and provides instant feedback on the graphical interface.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them. Especially for secretaries whose nature of work requires high productivity over certain periods of time,
undo/redo features are efficient ways to revert and start over.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* Added the ability to *sort engagements by customisable order*
** What it does: the sort feature takes in a parameter of engagements to sort by (e.g. starting time, priority, name etc.) and an ordering method (ascending and descending), and sorts the displayed engagement list accordingly.
Operations that require an index of an arrangement can be specified based on the order of such sorted lists. Moreover, the ordering is preserved when operations that modify the engagement list (e.g. adding a new engagement) take place.
** Justification: This feature is of significant value in actual scenarios, as secretaries usually deal with a massive amount of engagements, ranging from urgent to long-term, and important to less important. Sorting is thus needed in
displaying all entries in a customisable order, such that all engagements can be managed in an organised manner.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires a large number of customised comparators, which is managed using an Enum class. It also affects existing features that depend on the order of the displayed list or modify the list, which requires a good design of implementation and
careful tweaks to existing structures.

* *Minor enhancement*: refactored code from [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book - Level 3]] to fit the context of *_Typee_*

=== Sort feature
==== Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `EngagementComparator`.
The `EngagementComparator` is an enum class that implements Java Comparator<Engagement> and specifies the comparing logic of 8 different orders, namely `START_TIME`, `START_TIME_REVERSE`, `END_TIME`, `END_TIME_REVERSE`, `ALPHABETICAL`, `ALPHABETICAL_REVERSE`, `PRIORITY`, and `PRIORITY_REVERSE`.
Each positive sequence comparator compares two `Engagements` with the field specified within its name in ascending order, and `_REVERSE` comparators compare in descending order.

Additionally, the `Model` interface is modified to support the following methods:

* `Model#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)` -- Sets the designated comparator in model.
* `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()` -- Executes the sorting method with the `currentComparator` in model to sort the internal list.
* `Model#getSortedEngagementList()` -- Returns the current internal engagement list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList`.

These operations are implemented in the `ModelManager` class as `ModelManager#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)`, `ModelManager#updateSortedEngagementList()` and `ModelManager#getSortedEngagementList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `currentComparator` will be initialized as `null`.

image::SortListState0.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `sort p/priority o/ascending` command to sort the engagement list in ascending order of priority. The `sort` command calls `Model#setComparator()`, causing the `currentComparator` in ModelManager to assume the value `EngagementComparator#PRIORITY`. The command then calls `Model#updateSortedEngagementList` to execute the sorting.

image::SortListState1.png[width="450", align="center"]

NOTE: The parsing of `sort` follows the interactive parsing structure *_Typee_* adopts, where various stages are created while parsing. See Sequence Diagram below.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="750", align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `SortCommand` and the 3 Stages should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 3. The user executes `add t/meeting ... p/high` to add a new engagement. The `add` command also calls `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()` with `currentComparator`, causing the execution of sorting after the new engagement is added to the list, to preserve the current ordering.

image::SortListState2.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentComparator` assumes the initial value `null` when `Model#updateSortedEngagementList` is called, the method will simply catch the `NullPointerException` thrown by `java.object.requireNonNull` which will essentially abort the attempt to sort with an empty catch block. The initial chronological order is preserved in this case.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the engagement list or alter the order of the list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)`, or `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()`. Thus, the internal `ObservableList` remains unchanged.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the `List.sort(Comparator<T>)` function to sort the list.
** Pros: Has trivial support for features that updates the predicate of `FilteredList`, like `Find`.
** Cons: There is a need to sort the list each time a command that modifies the elements of the list is executed, which may result in performance issues in case the list size is large.
* **Alternative 2:** Replace the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager` with a `SortedList`.
** Pros: Sorting the list is more intuitive, and the ordering of the engagements is automatically preserved whenever a command that modifies the list elements is executed.
** Cons: Features like `find` command may lose functionality and needs extra modification.
