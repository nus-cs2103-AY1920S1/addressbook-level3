* A common issue when people hang out with friends is deciding on what to eat. As a person spends time to scan through their memory for good eateries, the meal timing will be delayed.
* Aiming to solve the issue, we came out with EatMe.
* A product that aims to help users to manage the eateries that they had visited, and keep track of their experience and expenditure.
* Although EatMe has a fully functional GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* EatMe allows users to:
1. Manage the eateries they visited
1. Include their own reviews on the eateries
1. Follow the feeds of their favourite bloggers
1. Create their own unique to-eat list.
1. etc.
* With EatMe, leave all the thinking behind and have an easy time deciding on where to eat.
