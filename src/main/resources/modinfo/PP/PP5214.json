    "description": "The public official is constantly confronted with choices that have ethical dimensions. An obvious one is the attempt to influence officials' decisions by corrupt means. However, ethical issues facing public officials are usually more subtle. They range from the way officials define their political mandate to how they think about policy options that profoundly affect the lives of others. This course will explore the range of ethical issues and choices that confronts public officials and develop skills in recognising and resolving them. This module is targeted at students who are interested in ethics and public official.",
