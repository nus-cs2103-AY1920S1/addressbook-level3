    "description": "It is commonly known that technology and culture are intricately interconnected to each other, existing in a relationship that is mutually constitutive. Technology\nproduces culture as much as the other way around. But such a relationship is complex and controversial. Both technology and cultural producers are not often selfreflexive about how the relationship impacts on their work, and unaware of the resulting ethical dilemmas and politics. This module introduces students to critical concepts in culture and technology studies focusing on social and political change, transformations in the way we think about civilization, and the formation of identity.",
