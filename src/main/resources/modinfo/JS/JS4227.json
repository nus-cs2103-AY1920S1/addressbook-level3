    "description": "This module is designed to promote students' understanding of some of the salient features of Japan's political economy, especially the roles of politicians and bureaucrats in the conduct of industrial and foreign economic policy. The module will review major research on Japan's political economy written from historical, theoretical and comparative perspectives. By exploring the changing international images of Japan in the field of political economy, the module aims to highlight: the role of the government in Japan's high postwar economic growth and features of its industrial policy-making processes; the relevance of high growth in other East Asian economies in comparison to the Japanese case; the different schools of thought on Japan's economic policy and the evolution of US-Japan trade friction in the 1980s; and Japan's approaches to and initiatives in deregulation in the 1990s.",
