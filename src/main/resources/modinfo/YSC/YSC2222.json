    "description": "The structure, properties, and reactivity of carbon-based molecules will be directly observed and inferred in this laboratory-based course, which supplements YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry. Students will put their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in practice and thus gain a much deeper understanding of the material. Topics include reaction set-up and purification, IR, NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS analysis, as well as an advanced synthesis project.",
