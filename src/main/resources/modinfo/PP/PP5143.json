    "description": "This course introduces the main concepts, methods and paradigm of game theory, decision theory and social choice through short cases borrowed from the current economic, political and business scene. It examines how these tools might lead us to make better decisions, from both an individual and a collective viewpoint. It explores the extent (and limitations) of rationality in individual and collective decision making; it characterizes normatively the outcome of such decisions. Examples from everyday life, sport, military operations or political conflicts will be used to illustrate the reach of game theory and decision theory as tools for strategic analysis.",
