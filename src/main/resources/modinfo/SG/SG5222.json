    "description": "This course focuses on best practices in managing IT as a service. IT Service Management is important as it supplements other aspects of IT management (such as IT Project Management). It goes beyond project implementation and emphasises the smooth ongoing operations of IT systems and services, and the planning, management and optimisation required to achieve it. It includes key management processes such as Service Level Management, Service Portfolio Management, Availability Management, Performance Management, Problem Management and others important to high quality IT services. IT Service Management is recognised as a critical component to the overall IT governance of an organisation. This course will cover ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), an international framework of best practices for IT Service Management. It will also include additional material relating to the new approach to services known as Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME).",
