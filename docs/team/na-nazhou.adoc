== PROJECT: Mark

:sectnums:
== Overview

*Mark* is designed for those who prefer to use a desktop application for managing bookmarks as well as tasks related to web pages.
More importantly, it is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mark is morphed from an existing desktop Java application https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/addressbook-level3/[Address Book (Level 3)] and several
enhancements were made to it over a period of 8 weeks by my team of 5 software developers.
The following sections document all the contributions that I have made to Mark.

== Summary of Contributions

Here is a summary of my personal contributions to the team project over the 8 weeks. All my code contributions
 can be found https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=na-nazhou&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Na-Nazhou&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[here].

=== Major Enhancement: Undo/Redo a specific number of previous commands
* *What it does*:
This feature allows the user to undo a given number previous undoable commands (i.e. commands that alter the state
of bookmarks or reminders). Previous undo commands can also be reversed by specifying the number
of actions the undo command has undone. A list of actions undone/redone by the user will also be shown
to the user as a command result displayed in the result display box after each undo/redo command.
* *Justification*:
This feature improves Mark significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the application should provide a convenient way to rectify them. In addition, allowing
users to specify the number of actions to undo/redo greatly improves users' productivity as they can now undo/redo multiple actions using one command
instead to typing undo/redo repeatedly.
* *Highlights*:
This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was required.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* *Credits*:
The basic idea is adapted from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook (Level 4)]

=== Minor Enhancements
* Added a `goto` command that can immediately open a bookmark in the embedded web view of the app
* Added support for opening any bookmark by double clicking the bookmark in either bookmark list, folder tree view or favorite bookmark list
in the GUI
* Added a `favorite` command that can add an existing bookmark to the list of favorite bookmarks and a separate list of
of favorite bookmarks to the dashboard tab of the app
* Improved the existing `add` command to support bookmarking current web page by supplying a keyword `this`
in place of the `URL` field
* Improved the existing `find` command to support filtering bookmarks by tags and/or folders

== Contributions to the User Guide

I wrote about the usage of `goto`, `favorite`, `undo` and `redo` commands for the User Guide.
Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide.
They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users.

=== Opening a bookmark: *`goto`*
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=goto-command]

=== Adding a bookmark to Favorites: *`favorite|fav`*
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=favorite-command]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=favorite-command-2]

=== Undoing previous commands: *`undo`*
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=undo-command]

=== Redoing previously undone commands: *`redo`*
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=redo-command]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

I modified the section about the logic component in the Developer Guide and
added the description of the architecture and some use cases of Undo/Redo feature to the Developer
Guide as well.
Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide.
They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.
