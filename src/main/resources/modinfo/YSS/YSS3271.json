    "description": "This course examines the place of performed political comedy (daily shows and stand up, for the most part) in contemporary politics. It is interested in the content of comedy and its effects. We shall read some theory and ask questions regarding the role of the comic and the role of humour in political discourse. We will focus on political comedy in English across countries including Singapore, India, United States, and UK (you are encouraged to examine other countries and other languages).",
