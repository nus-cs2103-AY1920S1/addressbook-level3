    "description": "The ocean covers 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface and, through its interaction with the atmosphere, plays a key role in Earth\u2019s climate. This course explores how marine ecosystems respond to, and play a role in, climate variability. We will examine factors regulating oceanic productivity, including how large-scale, coupled oceanographic/atmospheric processes, such as El Ni\u00f1o and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, affect food webs from plankton to commercially-harvested fish. This course will also look at the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the stability and productivity of marine ecosystems.",
