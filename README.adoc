This is a desktop application called *treasurerPro* (tP). +
It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) but this application has been tailored to enable user interaction mostly via the Command
Line Interface (CLI). +
This application is intended to aid treasurers of Co-curricular Activities and Societies with
better management of finances and reimbursements for its members. By packaging all functions in an application, it makes
planning and budgeting much easier.
