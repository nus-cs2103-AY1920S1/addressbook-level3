    "description": "Practice research aims to discover new things about theatre by doing it, rather than watching it. This module offers a group project in Theatre and Performance practice research designed and directed by the lecturer. Students are guided in the theoretical parameters and issues, project methodology, and development of the practical work. Through an individual role, each student considers how their practical experience and knowledge in local contexts interact with theory and methodology. The module extends over both semesters of one academic year to facilitate the longer-term growth of practice research outcomes. Admission is by portfolio submission and interviews / auditions.",
