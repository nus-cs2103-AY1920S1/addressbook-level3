    "description": "This is an advanced course in Psycholinguistics designed to explore pertinent issues in greater detail. It will cover some of the major areas of study in Psycholinguistics (including some basic Neurolinguistics), with special emphasis on child language acquisition. Students will also be exposed to research methods in Psycholinguistics, and to the mental processes we think may underlie language use. In the attempt to understand these processes in healthy individuals it is crucial that we also consider what happens when language becomes impaired. For this reason, this course will also examine evidence from both atypically developing children and language-impaired adults.",
