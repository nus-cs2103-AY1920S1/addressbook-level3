    "description": "The Roman Emperor Nero (AD 54-68) is a fascinating individual but one who is a challenge to reconstruct, tainted as he is by negative posthumous assessments (from cruel Emperor to the anti-Christ himself). Approached via a range of literary and material evidence \u2013 particularly the evidence from Nero\u2019s reign itself \u2013 students will gain an insight into the political, social and cultural life of Neronian Rome, as well as the personality and ideologies of the Emperor himself. Whether you judge him to be an artist, a visionary, a tyrant, or a madman, is up to you \u2026",
