== 1. Introduction

The purpose of the portfolio is to document my roles and contributions to the project, in terms of the code, the User
Guide and the Developer Guide.

=== 1.1 Overview

In a team of 5 software engineering students, we were tasked to enhance an existing desktop application,
link:https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/addressbook-level3/index.html[AddressBook], for our software
engineering project. We chose to morph it into a watchlist for movie and television series called
link:https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/main/index.html[EzWatchlist].
A limitation was to ensure that the application remains as a command-line interface application, which means that
users that use the application primary execute commands through typing.

My role was to design the code for the `search` feature and ensure proper documentation of the code in general. I had
to implement the `search` feature such that users would be able to search within the watchlist and from online. The
code had to be refactored and the `search` command had to be modified to allow users to search for different
categories such as searching by name or actor.

=== 1.2 About EzWatchList

EzWatchList is a desktop application, designed for those who types fast and prefer to work with Command Line
Interface (CLI) for managing movies and television series watchlist. It helps users keep track of the shows they had
watched or wish to watch, reducing the hassle of having to search for shows frequently.

| [NOTE] |  This symbol indicates information and tips to take note of.
| `Search` | A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command
line and executed by the application.
| (different front/colour text) | This indicates that it is a class, method or field in the code.
