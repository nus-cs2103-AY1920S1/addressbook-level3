    "description": "This module examines research, theory and practice related to the communication of social, health, and environmental risks. It looks at risk communication from multiple perspectives, including psychological, social, and cultural. It uses case studies to illustrate theories of risk perception and risk communication and effects of various risk communication strategies, including public involvement techniques. A cross-cutting theme is that theory and practice often intersect in shaping our understanding of how people perceive, react to, and communicate about risk. The course will emphasize understanding, applying, and developing theories of risk communication.",
