    "description": "How can we approach shared histories among locales of Chinese literary production? Treating Singapore-Malaysia as a nexus to consider its literary relations in the long 20th century with other localities (e.g., mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong), this course introduces the critical concept of 'place' to account for the shifting attributes and implications of the cultural linkages affecting our perspectives on literary heritage. Through literary texts that address questions of sojourn, mobility and migration, it highlights the importance of historicisation when analysing literary transregionalism and shows how geographical distance does not necessarily co-relate with the strength of connections.",
