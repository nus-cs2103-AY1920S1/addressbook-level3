== Introduction
---

=== Purpose
This portfolio is written to document my role as the *User Interface* (UI)
designer and my contributions to our project, *LiBerry*. The following sections
describe our project and the enhancements that I added in detail, together
with relevant documentation from the user guide and developer guide.

=== About the project
*LiBerry* is a *free*, *single-user*, and *lightweight* library management system,
that is designed to manage small community and private libraries. It does not
require any internet connection to function and is optimized for librarians
who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface* (CLI). The *Graphical User
Interface* (GUI) of *LiBerry* is created with *JavaFX* while the entire software
is written in *Java*.

The figure above shows the graphical user interface of our application,
LiBerry.

=== Motivations
*LiBerry* is created to promote the setting up of private and community
libraries, so as to improve literacy rates. One of the main reasons why
literacy rates is low due to the lack of accessibility of knowledge.
This is more prevalent in rural communities due to the lack of
sources of knowledge.

Hence, in order to breach this gap in knowledge, we created *LiBerry*,
which is a free, connectionless, easy to use library management system
so as to encourage more people to set up their own community libraries.

=== Main Features
The main features of *LiBerry* are:

* Adding/Removing of books
* Registering/Unregistering of borrowers
* Loaning/Returning of books
* Searching of books

These basic features would allow librarians to manage their libraries
effectively.

=== Major enhancement - Undo/Redo feature:

==== Description:
This feature enables users to undo all previous commands one at a time.
Undone commands can be reversed one at a time by using the redo command.

==== Justification:
This feature makes the application much more user friendly. This is because
this feature provides a convenient method for users to rectify any
immediate mistakes that was made.

==== Highlights:
This enhancement was implemented in a way that minimises the memory usage
required. In addition, this enhancement is extensible and can be applied to
future commands with little overheads. This required an in-depth analysis
of design alternatives and the consideration of the target audience of our
application.

=== Secondary enhancement - Set User Settings feature:

==== Description:
This feature enables users to set customisable settings to our application.
Some of the settings includes loan period, which is the number of days a
book can be loaned out, and renew period, which is the number of the days
a loan can be extended. These user settings are then stored locally so that
users do not have to set them every time they open the application.

==== Justification:
As every library have different loan policies, this feature allows libraries
to customise their own loan policies which is essential for the operation of
the library. This feature also allows users to set different policies for
different type of books which makes the application more flexible.

==== Highlights:
The most challenging part of this enhancement is making it persistent as
it requires some knowledge of teh storage system.

=== Minor enhancement:
Added a help command that opens up a window to show the users a summary of
commands available.
