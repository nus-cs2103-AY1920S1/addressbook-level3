    "description": "This course applies economic concepts to the practice of structuring business transactions. The materials consist of case studies of actual transactions. We will use those case studies to analyze the economics challenges that parties to a deal must address, and to analyse the mechanisms the parties use to address those challenges. The case studies will cover a selection from bond financings, acquisitions, movie financings, product licenses, biotech alliances, venture capital financings, cross-border joint ventures, private equity investments, corporate reorganizations, and more.",
