    "description": "This is part 1 of a 2-module package \u2013 Engineering Principles and Practice - that introduces Year 1 students to what engineers do and the engineer's thought process. EPP I focuses on the engineering principles of how systems work and fail, and the engineering practice of how they are designed, built and valued. Given a practical engineering system, e.g. a drone, or an engineering event, e.g. the Challenger space shuttle disaster, students are guided to deconstruct the system into inter-connected sub-systems. Following which they will develop an understanding of how forces, energy flow and/or mass flow between sub-systems impact the whole.",
