== Introduction

Weme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, Weme is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Weme can let you manage memes faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `weme.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Weme.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`tab memes`* : switches to the memes tab
* In the memes tab:
** *`list`* : lists all memes
** **`add`**`p//Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg d/Top meme` : adds a meme located at `/Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg` with the description `Top meme`
** **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd meme shown in the memes tab
** *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

****
* Weme only supports certain image files with valid extensions (e.g. `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`).
* Any invalid or corrupted files are ignored (e.g. `.txt`, invalid files
with `.jpg` extension, unsupported image formats).
* We recommend a minimum resolution of 1920x1080 with at maximum 150% scaling for best usage. Weme requires a resolution that provides at least 750 pixels in height and 1000 pixels in width for smooth usage.
****

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add p/PATH`, `PATH` is a parameter which can be used as `add p//Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `p/PATH [t/TAG]` can be used as `p//Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg t/cs2103` or as `p//Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cs2103`, `t/soc t/funny` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `p/PATH d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION p/PATH` is also acceptable.
* Commands that do not require parameters will ignore additional parameters provided. e.g. `list 1` is the same as `list`.
* Whenever `INDEX` is encountered, it refers to the index in the currently displayed list and *must be a positive integer*.

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits Weme. +
Format: `exit`

=== Memes Tab

==== Adding a meme: `add`

Adds a new meme to Weme. Weme will copy the given image into its data storage folder. +
Format: `add p/PATH [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...` +

[TIP]
A meme can have any number of tags (including 0). Tags can only contain letters and numbers and cannot exceed a length of 35 characters.

****
* The `PATH` argument can be either a relative path or an absolute path.
** On MacOS and *nix systems
*** Absolute paths start with `/` (e.g. `/home/me/Downloads/doge.jpg`).
*** Relative paths start directly with the file/directory name (e.g. `data/images/doge.jpg`), and is resolved in the current working directory.
** On Windows
*** Absolute paths start with a drive letter (e.g. `C:/Users/me/Downloads`)
*** Relative paths are the same as those on MacOS and *nix systems.
* Note the double `/` near the prefix `p/` in the example given.
This is because the examples in this guide use MacOS absolute file paths, which start with a `/`.
Therefore, the first `/` is part of the argument prefix, whereas the second `/` is part of the file path.
If you are using MacOS or *nix systems, both `/` s must be present if your path is an absolute path.
If you are using Windows, your command might look something like `add p/C:/Users/Me/Downloads/dgirl_off.jpg` instead.
* The path must lead to one of our supported image formats. (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`)
****

Example:

* `add p//Users/Me/Downloads/dgirl_oof.jpg t/Funny` +
Adds a meme with the image from `/Users/Me/Downloads/dgirl_oof.jpg` and tag `Funny`

Illustration of adding a meme with description `Cat and child` and tags `baby` and `cuteCat`: +

****

==== Adding text: `add`

Adds a piece of text to the template. +
Format: `add TEXT x/X_COORDINATE y/Y_COORDINATE [c/COLOR] [s/SIZE] [S/STYLE]...`

****
* `X_COORDINATE` and `Y_COORDINATE` denote the position at which the supplied text will be placed and are represented as ratios of the image dimensions.
`x/0.5 y/0.3` means the *center* of the supplied text will be 50% right of the left border and 30% down from the top border.
* `COLOR` can be a name, e.g. `cyan`, or a hex RGB value, e.g. `#FF34E2`.
* Weme supports 6 levels of font size. `SIZE` must be an integer from 1 to 6, where 1 denotes the smallest font size and 6 denotes the largest font size. Some text of each font size can be found at the right hand side of the image as a reference. Note that the sample sizes only apply to templates whose width/height ratio do not deviate too much from 1.
* `STYLE` must be `plain`, `bold`, or `italic`. In the case you specify multiple font styles, Weme will combine them. For example, `S/bold S/italic` will give you bold and italic text.
* If you do not specify `COLOR`, `SIZE`, or `STYLE`, the default values will be used. The default values are black, 5, and plain, respectively.
* Weme will not add text that would exceed the image boundary. If it detects such a scenario, it will print an error message.
****

[TIP]
The x and y coordinates given in the command specify the position for the *center* of the text.
This means if you want to add text to the center of the image, the command will always be `add TEXT x/0.5 y/0.5` no matter how long your text is.

Examples:

* `add CS students be like x/0.5 y/0.3` +
Adds text `CS students be like` to the template, placing its *center* 50% right of the left border and 30% down from the top border.
* `add sToNKs x/0.5 y/0.75 c/red s/5 S/bold` +
Adds red and bold text `sToNKs` with size 5 to the template, placing its *center* 50% right of the left border and 75% down from the top border.

==== Editing text: `edit`

Whenever you add text, the list at the right hand side will be updated. +
The `edit` command allows you to choose and edit a piece of text from that list. +
Format: `edit INDEX [t/TEXT] [x/X_COORDINATE] [y/Y_COORDINATE] [c/COLOR] [s/SIZE] [S/STYLE]...`

****
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing text styles, the existing styles of the text will be removed i.e adding of styles is not cumulative.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 t/CODE` +
Changes the text at index 1 to `CODE`.
* `edit 2 x/0.5` +
Changes the x-coordinate of the text at index 2 to 0.5.
* `edit 3 c/#FC1423 s/5 S/bold` +
Edits the text at index 3, changing its color to #FC1423, size to 5 and style to bold.

==== Moving text: `move`

Moves the specified text. +
Format: `move INDEX [x/X_CHANGE] [y/Y_CHANGE]`

****
* The move is relative to the current position of the specified text.
* At least one of `X_CHANGE` and `Y_CHANGE` must be specified.
****

Examples:

* `move 1 x/-0.1` +
Moves the text at index 1 to the left by 10% of the image width.
* `move 2 y/0.3` +
Moves the text at index 2 down by 30% of the image height.
* `move 3 x/0.2 y/-0.3` +
Moves the text at index 3 to the right by 20% of the image width and up by 30% of the image height.

[TIP]
You can type `move INDEX` and use arrow keys to move the specified text. +
Hold kbd:[Shift] while pressing arrow keys to make the text move faster. +
Hold kbd:[Alt] (kbd:[Option] on MacOS) while pressing arrow keys to make the text move slower.


==== Deleting text: `delete`

Format: `create [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TAG]...`

****
* This command does not modify the template you used to start the creation session. You can use the same template to make more memes.
* You will be directly to view the meme you have created. To continue making new memes, use `tab templates` to go to the templates tab.
****

Examples:

* `create d/sleep or code t/soc t/cs2103` +
Creates a new meme from the current meme creation session, giving it a description `sleep or code` and tags `soc` and `cs2103`.

image::stats_panel.png[]

[TIP]
As the statistics data is updated real time, an undo/redo command affecting the memes and their data will re-render
the statistics charts. E.g. after executing `like 1` in Memes panel for meme with tag `cute` and undo it in statistics
panel, the charts will be re-rendered, with like count for tag `cute` incremented. Same goes to `edit` command that
edits the tags of a meme.

// tag::command-suggestion[]
=== Command Suggestions

Weme supports command suggestions and auto-completion using kbd:[tab] for every command available.
****
* Suggestions for command word/argument based on current user input will be displayed in the result box.
* The auto-suggestion is dynamic and automatically updates while the user type in command.
* The suggestions are retrieved from historical records and sorted according to the similarity to user input, with the first suggestion
being the most recommended one.
* For the command word suggestion, only commands available for current context will be displayed.
Description for each command will be displayed after each command word.
* User can press kbd:[Tab] key to auto-complete the command suggestion, i.e. replacing current command word/arguments with
the first suggestion displayed (if there is any).
* If the user input is of invalid format, the text will turn red and error messages will be displayed in the result box
immediately without pressing kbd:[Enter] key. This does not account for invalid values, e.g. input meme index is 5 but there is
no meme of index 5.
****

Examples:

* When user types in `a` in the meme tab, the following suggestions will appear: +
`add: adds a meme to Weme. +
archive: archive a meme by index. +
archives: list all archived memes.`
