== Introduction

KeyboardFlashCards (KFC) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to study using flashcards.
More importantly, it is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, KFC
can help you manage your flashcards much more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? You should be! KFC is perfect for NUS Computing students. We even have additional
features not available with most flashcard managers that we're sure you'll love. Enjoy!

Please also note the following icons, which will indicate points of interest throughout this document.

NOTE: A point of information that you may wish to note

TIP: A tip or suggestion

CAUTION: A cautionary word of advice

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest build KeyboardFlashCards.jar link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-4/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your KFC app.

== Features
This section contains the features and their respective commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add >QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter. The command format would thus be as such: `add q>1+1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `q>QUESTION [c>CATEGORY]` can be used as `q>1+1 c>math` or as `q>1+1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be inserted zero or more times e.g. `[c>CATEGORY]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `c>math`, `c>math c>school` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q>QUESTION a>ANSWER`, `a>ANSWER q>QUESTION` is also acceptable.
* Currently, our application does not support emoji.

=== Export flashcards to a file: `export c>CATEGORY p>FILE_PATH`

You can use this command to export all your FlashCards in a particular category, to an external file.
This may be useful if you wish to publish your FlashCards somewhere, print them out, or share them with a friend.
The file will be located at the file path that you specify, and the format of the file will be inferred from the
extension. We currently support exporting to JSON ('.json') and document ('.docx') file formats. +
Example: `export c>CS2105 p>C:\Documents\cs2105.json`

Suppose you have a category named `CS2105`, and you wanted to export the FlashCards in that category to an external file
(so you can share them with your friend). Here's how you would go about this:

. Type the example command given above into the command box (`export c>CS2105 p>C:\Documents\cs2105.json`), as shown below.
+
image::ExportDemo1.png[width="600"]

. Press **Enter** to execute the command. The results box will display a success message similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.
+
image::ExportDemo2.png[width="600"]

. Using your file explorer, navigate to the directory that you specified in the command (in this case, it would be `C:\Documents`). Sure enough, your exported file is there!
+
image::ExportDemo3.png[width="600"]

Please refer to the table below for a summary of the file formats that we support exporting to:

|====
|**Format**|Document ('.docx')|JSON ('.json')
|**Intended purpose**|For use as a cheat sheet|For sharing
|**What is copied from each FlashCard**|Question and answer only|Question, answer, and the category which you specified in the export command
|====

NOTE: If you're on a Unix-based operating system (e.g. Mac OS, Linux), any absolute paths that you specify will have to begin from the root directory `/`, not the user directory `~`. For example, if you were on a Mac and your username was "jason", and you wanted to export to a document file on your desktop, the file path would be `/Users/jason/Desktop/document.docx`.

CAUTION: Your file paths must be comprised solely of alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following characters: `~\/-_!:[]()` +
It must also end in one of the supported file extensions - either `.json` or `.docx`. +
{blank} +
Do note that some directories may be protected by your operating system (`C:\` on Windows, `/` on Unix). You may not be allowed to save files to these directories. +
{blank} +
Please take care not to modify exported JSON files - your friends might have trouble importing them otherwise.

=== Import flashcards from a JSON file: `import p>FILE_PATH`

You can use this command to import FlashCards from a file that you or someone else had exported to earlier.

Suppose that your friend has kindly exported some of his FlashCards for you to use. You have download the JSON file that he sent you,
and it's currently located at the following path: `C:\Downloads\cs2105.json`.
Your next step is to get those FlashCards into your copy of KFC. Here's how you'd go about this:

The last chart displays your performance (in percentage) for all tests completed. Performance is determined by the ratio of FlashCards rated as good and easy to FlashCards rated as hard.
+

*A*: You select a category and a date, and the program will remind you to revise that category when the date comes.

*Q*: How will the program know if my answer is good or bad? +
*A*: It doesn’t know - you have to decide for yourself whether you are satisfied with your answer.

*Q*: Will I be able to resume the test from where I left off after I have stopped? +
*A*: No. The program does not support that.
