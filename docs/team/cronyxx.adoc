== Introduction
---

=== Purpose
This portfolio is written to document my role as the *User Interface* (UI)
designer and my contributions to our project, *LiBerry*. The following sections
describe our project and the enhancements that I added in detail, together
with relevant documentation from the user guide and developer guide.

=== About the project
*LiBerry* is a *free*, *single-user*, and *lightweight* library management system,
developed by my team of 5 people for our software engineering module.
It is a command line application designed for small community and private libraries in
rural areas. Considering the lack of internet access in rural areas, the
application is designed to not require any internet connection to function.

The figure below displays the graphical user interface of our application.

The *Graphical User Interface* (GUI) of *LiBerry*, as shown above,
is created with *JavaFX* while the entire software is written in *Java*.

=== Main Features
The main features of *LiBerry* are:

* Adding/Removing of books
* Registering/Unregistering of borrowers
* Loaning/Returning of books
* Searching of books

These basic features would allow librarians to manage their libraries
effectively.

=== Key symbols

=== Major enhancement - Undo/Redo feature:

==== Description:
This feature enables users to undo all previous commands one at a time.
Undone commands can be reversed one at a time by using the redo command.

==== Justification:
This feature makes the application much more user friendly. This is because
this feature provides a convenient method for users to rectify any
immediate mistakes that was made.

==== Highlights:
This enhancement was implemented in a way that minimises the memory usage
required. In addition, this enhancement is extensible and can be applied to
future commands with little overheads. This required an in-depth analysis
of design alternatives and the consideration of the target audience of our
application.

=== Secondary enhancement - Set User Settings feature:

==== Description:
This feature enables users to set customisable settings to our application.
Some of the settings includes loan period, which is the number of days a
book can be loaned out, and renew period, which is the number of the days
a loan can be extended. These user settings are then stored locally so that
users do not have to set them every time they open the application.

==== Justification:
As every library have different loan policies, this feature allows libraries
to customise their own loan policies which is essential for the operation of
the library. This feature also allows users to set different policies for
different type of books which makes the application more flexible.

==== Highlights:
The most challenging part of this enhancement is making it persistent as
it requires some knowledge of teh storage system.

=== Minor enhancement:
Added a help command that opens up a window to show the users a summary of
commands available.
