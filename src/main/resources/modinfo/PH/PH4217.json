    "description": "This module aims to examine specific philosophical topics or issues (e.g. causation, the nature of mind, moral motivation) from a historical perspective. The topics or issues in question may be examined within the framework of different philosophical traditions (e.g. Chinese, Indian and Western), or across traditions. It is aimed at providing philosophy students with an understanding and appreciation of the history of the discipline, so that they gain a wider perspective, and can better locate current philosophical debates in the context of broader movements in intellectual history.",
