    "description": "This module explores the history of Myanmar (Burma).\n\nOrganized chronologically from the emergence of the\n\nearliest polities to the present, students will examine the\n\nformation and interaction of communities, ideological\n\nworldviews, ethnic identities, and material cultures that\n\nhave characterized the societies that evolved along the\n\nIrrawaddy River basin and beyond. Module content will\n\nconsider the particulars of Myanmars history (early stateformation\n\nand the historical development of Burmese\n\nidentity) within regional/global processes and themes.\n\nFundamentally, this module addresses why contemporary\n\nMyanmar is perceived to be so different from its regional\n\nneighbours despite sharing many historical and cultural\n\nexperiences.",
