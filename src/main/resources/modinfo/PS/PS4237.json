    "description": "This module investigates the ways in which political philosophers have legitimated, questioned, and critiqued property, markets, money, wage labour, and profit, as well as capitalism as a system. Students will become familiar with liberal, libertarian, Keynesian, Polanyian, and Marxist theories of capitalism and its institutions. In order to understand our contemporary political economy and how it came to be, the module will place particular emphasis on philosophies that justify capitalism and how capitalism has been linked to freedom, equality, justice, and utility.",
