    "description": "An exploration of the concepts and tools for analysing complex systems, with special focus on how natural and social systems function and change. The fundamentals of energy, material, and information flows through systems will be reviewed, and methods for extending these concepts to social systems will be introduced. The implications of key system concepts (e.g. feedback, thresholds, dynamic equilibrium, leverage points, and punctuated equilibrium) will be analysed, with special focus on the underlying drivers of system resilience and resistance in the natural and social world. Students will work together on a system modelling project.",
