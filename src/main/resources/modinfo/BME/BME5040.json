Participants will acquire hands-on experience applying descriptive (What is going on?), prescriptive (What should we do?) and predictive (What will happen?) analytical tools to pertinent data in order to extract insights for smart decisions in an uncertain environment. A holistic methodology (encompassing problem-formulation, model building, data preparation, software application, What-If analyses and effective / ethical communications of findings and recommendations to a lay audience) will be routinely applied to cases arising in various organisational settings e.g. Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain, HR, Government etc.",
