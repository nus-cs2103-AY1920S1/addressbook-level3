    "description": "Everybody feels. Our feelings drive us to do and are indicators of the state of our minds. In this course, we take a broad look at human emotions across cultures. We ask: what functions do emotions serve? Do gender differences exist? Are emotions and rationality at odds? How do society and technology affect how we feel, our perception of what we ought to feel, and what feelings we are willing to express? What is the relationship between the feeling mind and the body? What is the role of emotion in artificial intelligence?",
