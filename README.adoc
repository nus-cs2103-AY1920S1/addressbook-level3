Study planning is tough. We students waste precious time putting our study plan together, poring through modules to see
if they fit our graduation requirements. And for a year one, all of this can be especially overwhelming.

With ModBuddy, study planning is made easy. Our application is created for incoming CS undergraduates in NUS to
plan their studies across all semesters. As a user, you may:

* View your entire study plan at one glance
* Add and remove modules easily across semesters
* Check if your plan meets graduation requirements
