Major topics include domestic and international labour migration; the impacts of gender, class, ethnicity, and nationality on mobility; the politics and economics of mobility vs. native place; transnational mobility; transportation networks; and domestic and international tourism. The module introduces students to a range of historical and contemporary issues through the theoretical lens of mobility, providing them with not only a comprehensive understanding of the importance of human mobility within Japan, but also the theoretical background to apply their knowledge beyond Japan.",
