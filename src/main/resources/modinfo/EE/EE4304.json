    "description": "This module provides students with system theory, analysis tools and design methods in discrete-time domain. It is the first course in control and automation that systematically introduces the basic concepts and principles in sampling, Z-transform, zero-order-hold, discrete equivalence and the relations to discrete-time control design. It further examines the design issues for digital PID, PID auto-tuning, phase compensator, and the model predictive control, including the performance criteria, pole-placement, as well as numerous illustrative application examples.",
