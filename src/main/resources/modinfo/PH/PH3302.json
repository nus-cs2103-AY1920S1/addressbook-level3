    "description": "This second half of a two-part course on Chinese Philosophical Traditions focuses on Early Modern Chinese Philosophy. This module focuses on the changes in the Confucian tradition between the late Tang through the Qing. We cover the main figures in Neo-Confucianism, and examine in detail the philosophies of Zhu Xi (1130-1200) and Wang Yangming (1472-1529). We close with a discussion of the philological turn in the Qing dynasty. We treat these thinkers and their ideas in their proper historical contexts and evaluate their philosophies critically. We also address and assess the relevance of these ideas to contemporary philosophical debates.",
