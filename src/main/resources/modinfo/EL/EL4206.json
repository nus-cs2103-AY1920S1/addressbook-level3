    "description": "In this module we will be exploring how children acquire their first language (we will also briefly consider second language acquisition) and how language develops in the early years. Students will be exposed to the various theories of child language acquisition, the ways in which child language is studied, and the developmental stages of language. In addition to these topics, we will also examine atypical language development as well as studies of non-human communication since these throw light on the typical course of language development.",
