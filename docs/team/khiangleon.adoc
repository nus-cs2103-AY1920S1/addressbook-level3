== Introduction
This portfolio provides an overview of the CS2103/T Revision Tool and highlights my contribution
in the project including a brief description of the key features that I implemented.

=== The Team
Our team of 5 consists of 2 Year 4 Engineering Science students, a Year 2 Computer Science / Business student, a Year
3 Communications and New Media student and myself, a Year 4 Industrial & Systems Engineering student.

=== About the Project

This 7-week project was started as part of NUS' Software Engineering (CS2103/T) module. The team was required to
to either morph or enhance an existing application (link:{ab3Url}/[Address Book - Level 3]). Our team decided to morph the project
into the CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT), a desktop quiz application which allows users to create their very own
personally customised question banks and attempt these questions in the format of timed quizzes
in an interactive manner later on. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has
a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

As a member of the project, I have volunteered to set up the project on GitHub and invited all of the group members
into our team Repo. I have helped out in milestones and project management. I have been actively monitoring the build
status of our project on GitHub. Furthermore, I developed the data analytics part of the application.

* *Major enhancement*: added *data analytics for the quiz*

** *What it does*: `stats` command generates and displays a list of past results of quiz attempts and their
respective breakdown into scores for each difficulty levels. For each quiz attempt, the application also indicates to
the user which type of questions the user did the worst in.
`history` command shows the raw history of all quiz results and its breakdowns by difficulty levels to the user.
This feature also indicates the number of quizzes attempted by the user so far.
** *Justification*: This essential feature aids in keeping a record of all quiz results. The feature carries out
some data processing and analytics before reporting these extra information back to the user in a proper format.
This feature significantly improves the product by providing additional helpful information to the user
so as to aid in improving his or her quiz scores and ultimately her revision outcome.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement required the deep understanding of the entire project structure including the
new quiz driver feature that forms the backbone of the project. It involves passing and retrieving of information from
UI to Storage. Some tests were written for this feature. The `History` Class is created for subsequent storage
of any statistical information of past quizzes.
** Credits: Code for the GUI display and storage of information of this feature was adapted from Address Book – Level 3.

* *Minor enhancements*: added *the delete multiple questions feature for the app*
** Enabled `delete` to remove multiple questions at once based on listed index in configuration mode.


* *Code contributed*: You can view the code I contributed to this project link:{contributedCodeUrl}/[here, window=blank]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases v1.1 - v1.2 (2 releases) on GitHub
*** Managed and resolved issues actively throughout project duration.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote additional GUI tests to increase coverage from 50% to 75% (PR link:{pullUrl}/158[#158], link:{pullUrl}/161[#161], link:{pullUrl}/163[#163])
