    "description": "This module challenges today\u2019s generation of students to reexamine and debate some of the foundational myths and assumptions about Singapore\u2019s pioneer past. The timespan covers Singapore\u2019s founding as a colonial economic 'place' in 1819, the events leading to postcolonial independence in 1959\u20131965, and the formation of communities into a 'nation'. We will focus on the interplay of global economic factors with internal social factors, and challenge students to ask how the engagement of communities and community leaders impacts economic development.",
