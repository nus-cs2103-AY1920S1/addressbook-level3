    "description": "Global marketing as an art and a science is an area of increasing importance to corporations, non-profit organizations, institutions and governments the world over. To succeed as a global executive, one must develop a global perspective with a clear global mindset. The essence of marketing is communications. Effective marketing requires having empathy for one\u2019s target audience, or stakeholders from company employees to customers to partners to investors. Global marketing, therefore, requires developing an understanding not only of the various regions and markets in the world but also, an awareness and understanding of the distinctive characteristics of consumers and corporate buyers in different markets. Because of the many components in marketing, doing it on a global scale involves having to work with different levels of economic, educational, infrastructural, legal, political and cultural development. Global marketing adds exponential complexity to the task of marketing.",
