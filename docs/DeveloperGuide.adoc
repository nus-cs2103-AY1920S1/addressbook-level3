== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MymParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an expense).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `BudgetList` object that represents the user's budgets.
* stores an `ExpenseList` object that represents the user's untagged expenses.
* stores an `ExchangeData` object that represents the foreign exchange rates for conversion of currencies.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Budget>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to either list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Budget` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Expense` objects in json format and read it back.
* can read `Exchange` objects in json format.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Budget Feature
==== Overview
The Budget feature allows users to track their expenses in relation to the budget set. Expenses created by the user after a budget is set and falls into a budget period will
automatically be added into that budget.

The feature allows the user to view a list of all the budgets created in the app. From the list of budgets, users may view any specific budget
showing all the expenses allocated into the budget, along with the amount left in the budget.
Users may add, delete, edit a budget as well as the expenses inside the budget.

==== Implementation
The `BudgetList` stores all the budgets created in the App. To facilitate the adding, deleting and editing of budgets, the BudgetList provides a
few operations such as: +
`BudgetList#addBudget(budget)` - Add a new budget into the list of budgets in the budget list. +
`BudgetList#setBudget(budget, editedBudget)` - Edit a current existing budget to a different budget +
`BudgetList#removeBudget(budget)` - Remove a specified budget

Given below is an activity diagram to show how a budget is added.

image::AddBudgetActivityDiagram.png[]

Given below is an activity diagram to show how an expense is added after the implementation of budget.

image::AddExpenseActivityDiagram.png[]

Given below is a class diagram of a Budget.

image::BudgetClassDiagram.png[]

Notice that the budget consists of 2 Amounts and 2 Dates. +
The 2 Amounts refer to the Budget Amount set by the user and the Budget Amount
currently left after deducting all expenses in the budget. +
The 2 Dates refer to the Start Date of the Budget and the End Date of the budget. All expenses added after the budget is created,
and fall within this 2 dates, will be automatically added into the budget.

Given below is an example of a object diagram of a newly created Budget.

image::BudgetObjectDiagram.png[]

The Budget consists of an ExpenseList which holds all expenses added into the Budget.

==== Design Consideration
There were 2 main design choices we had to choose from for the implementation of the Budget Feature. +

*Aspect: A single source of truth* +
The model consists of an expense list and a budget list.

- *Alternative 1:* Have a master expense list to store all expenses created and a budget list that consist of an internal
expense list that stores copies of the expenses from master expense list that fall into the budget. In this option, commands that affect expenses, will require
an update in the master expense list and the expense lists inside budgets affected. +
    * Pros: Easy to implement, easy to keep track of a overall expenses.
    * Cons: Multiple objects of the same expense. An update to an expense in the overall expense list will require a same update
            to the same expense located in the budget. May result in bugs when commands affect expenses.

- *Alternative 2:* Have a default expense list that stores only expenses that do not fall into a budget, and a budget list that consist
of an internal expense list that stores the expenses that fall into a budget when the expense is added or edited. In this option, there is only
1 copy of any expense created by the user. Any edit or delete of an expense affects directly to the original expense object.
    * Pros: Achieve a single source of truth. Does not introduce possible bugs that may be present if there were multiple copies of the same expense.
    * Cons: More complex to implement. In order to view all expenses in the app, the program will have to loop through the default expense list
            and the expense lists of every single budget.

*Alternative 2* was chosen. Reason is because a single source of truth would eliminate duplicate entries of the same data. This would
also reduce the possibility of bugs that may come with duplicate entries.

=== AutoComplete Feature
==== Implementation
Autocomplete is facilitated by several parts.
The logic part is implemented through `java.seedu.address.logic.search` package which contains `AutoComplete` and
`BinarySearch`.

The model is constructed through `java.seedu.address.model.autocomplete` which contains `AutoCompleteModel` and `Word`.

The Ui part is implemented through `java.seedu.address.ui.QueryCard` on top of `CommandBox`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step. (p.s. details are
omitted)

Step 1. The user launches MYMorise and the user will be prompted to enter a command as shown in the command box.

Step 2. User enter `a` and the listener is triggered. Then `AutoComplete#initAc()` and
`AutoComplete#getSuggestions()` is invoked.

Step 3. `initAc()` calls `AutoComplete#readWordsFromFile()` which reads the vocabulary from our local dictionary to get
the database and then construct an `AutocompleteModel` with the vocabulary read.

Step 4. `getSuggestions(input)` calls `AutocompleteModel#allMatches()` which utilises the improved version of binary
search algorithm `BinarySearch`. The algorithm will return the first and last index of potential matched results.
Since the result is based on a pre-order for sorting, all the words inside this range will be the qualified ones.

Step 5. The listview of `QueryCard` will be updated based on the words and weights given and attached to the
`TextField`.

The following sequence diagram shows how autocomplete operation works:

image::AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enter something new.

image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Autocomplete works
In terms of the retrieving suggestion list, an enhanced binary search algorithm is used. Since a word (which
represents a autocomplete term) has a name and weight, the default "vocabulary" will be first sort based on weight
and for same weight, sort alphanumerically.

In terms of replacing the target term to the `TextField`, 2 approaches are proposed

* **Approach 1 (current choice)**: 2 listeners were added. 1) 1st listener for `TextFormatter`, this is especially
utilised
to retrieving the updated cursor position, which is where it outperforms. 2) 2nd listener for
`TextInputControl`
to detect the text change of `TextField`. Then combined with previously returned caret position, we can replace the
corresponding position with target term (the one user selected)

* **Approach 2**. 1 listener for `caretProperty` is added to detect the change of position of caret (i.e., cursor).
This approach is simpler with regard to logic but more complicated during implementation. Since caret position change
does not necessarily mean textField change, therefore extra check would be required, also resulting in
potential inaccuracy.

In terms of user interaction, different listeners are added for different valid actions (e.g. press TAB, ENTER and
navigate using UP and DOWN) to make user benefit by typing faster.

=== History Feature
==== Implementation
History is mainly facilitated by `CommandHistory` with `HistoryPointer`. When the app starts, a `CommandHistory`
instance is created and any command executed (no matter valid or not) will be saved to a list of history commands.
And when the user calls the `history`, the overall history list will display on the `resultDisplayPanel`. And when
user press *F3* and *F4* to navigate through the history list, the `HistoryPointer` will point to corresponding
history.

Similar to Section 3.1, the history displayed on `textField` is facilitated by `KeyEventListener`. When the keyinput
event of *F3* or *F4* is triggered, it will navigate to previous input and next input correspondingly.

The following class diagram illustrates the interaction between `historyCommand` and other parts:

image::HistoryClassDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of how history commands works:

image::HistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Currency Conversion
==== Implementation
The Currency conversion is achieved by having a default base currency that all expenses and budgets use if one is not specified. The expenses that are stored
with a different currency can be converted from the base currency and back. Every time a currency is specified, the present day exchange rate is stored with the expense. This
is to ensure that the expense value is timeless.

This was implemented in the `java.seedu.address.model.exchangedata` package, which contains `ExchangeDataSingleton`, `ExchangeData`, and `Rates`. These classes facilitate retrieval of exchange rates that will be requested from various parts of the app, namely `Expense` and `Budget`.

*Step 1*
The foreign currency exchange rates are downloaded for the app to use from http://exchangeratesapi.io/[ExchangeRatesAPI.io] using their endpoint `https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=SGD`. The endpoint returns the data in JSON format, which works well with the existing JSON based storage used for `Expense` and `Budget`. This was implemented in the `java.seedu.address.commons.utils` package containing `HttpsClientUtil` which facilitates the Asynchronous calls to the endpoint to update the local copy of the foreign currency exchange rates upon app startup.

*Step 2*
The JSON response is persisted on disk. A default data-set of exchange rates will be generated at runtime (but not stored) in the case of unstable or no internet access if one is not yet present. If one was present however a more recent one could not be downloaded, the existing data will be reused.

*Step 3*
If the exchange data is present as a JSON, it will first be loaded into its JSON reflection class `JsonAdaptedExchangeData` which depends on `JsonAdaptedRates`. These classes assist in the conversions of the JSON to the Model Class `ExchangeData`.

    Presently, ExchangeData is also stored in the StorageManager which was intended to be used to store multiple instances of ExchangeData to load historical exchange rates when the user does an edit, however this proved to be infeasible to implement within the course of the project.

*Step 4*
The `ExchangeDataSingleton` is updated with the new  `ExchangeData` using the `ExchangeDataSingleton#updateInstance`. The reason for using the Singleton pattern in this case was to ensure that one and only one instance of `ExchangeData` is being referenced to retrieve data at any point in time. Since it is also required to be accessed by `Expense` and `Budget`.

*Step 5*
Conversions are done in `Expense#getConvertedAmount` for conversion back into the base currency (SGD) and `Expense#getConvertedAmount(Currency currency)` for conversions to any other currency. As most transactions in the app that require the conversion of currency involve an expense (including recomputing `amountLeft` of `Budget`), the computation is done in the expense. The following are the instance where the currency is converted:

* Whenever an expense is displayed on the `ExpenseCard` or `CommandResult`, its converted value will be computed and displayed together with its conversion rate and original amount.

The following sequence diagram shows how currency conversion works:

image::CurrencyConversionSequenceDiagram.png[]



==== Design Consideration
There were 3 main design choices we had to choose from for the implementation of the Currency Conversion Feature. +

- *Alternative 1:* Do not store currency rates when expenses are added with a selected currency and simply store the currency. +
    * Pros: Easy to implement, recompute the amount of the expense based on the present day currency exchange rate.
* Cons: If there was a crash in any currency, the expense amount will no longer be timeless. For instance, if an expense of of 10 MYR was stored today and was converted to 3 SGD (converted at 3.33), then the exchange rate became 2.0 the following day, the budget would reflect the amount left wrongly when it was recomputed the next day.

- *Alternative 2:* Persist all the exchange rates to file every time the app is launched to ensure that the user's expenses are computed based on the exchange rate that was on that specific day. The specific exchange rate used is not stored in the expense itself.
* Pros: Achieve timeless expense which will provide the most accurate values when computing the budget amount left.
* Cons: Slightly harder to implement as there are multiple sources for exchange rate data based on dates. This will also bloat the amount of space requirement of the app as time persists.

- *Alternative 3:* Store the specific exchange rate used together with the expense whenever it is added, update the exchange rates daily and only persist the latest rates.
* Pros: Achieve timeless expense which will provide the most accurate values when computing the budget amount left, without the need to store historical exchange rates. Reduced space used and single source of truth for computing exchange rates.
* Cons: Expenses added in the past that have their currencies changed will not be able to use the exchange rate of that specific day.

*Alternative 3* was chosen as it was a balance between the cons across all 3 considerations, and the timelessness of an expense carries more weight than the unlikely event that the user would need to alter the currency of a past expense.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Deleting an expense

. Deleting an expense while all expenses are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all expenses using the `list` command. Multiple expenses in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First expense is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted expense shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No expense is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
