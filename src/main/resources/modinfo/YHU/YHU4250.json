    "description": "This is an advanced, interdisciplinary course which introduces students to a new field in the study of diplomacy. Cultural approaches to the history of global diplomacy draw influences from a wide range of disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences including history, international relations, anthropology, geography, sociology, performance and theatre studies, and visual studies. As such, the course is primarily designed to examine new approaches through the three categories of diplomatic actors, diplomatic practices, and diplomatic spaces. The course materials cover from the 1750s to the present, in order to shed light on the evolution of diplomacy from the early modern to modern period.",
