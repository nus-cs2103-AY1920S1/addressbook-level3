*_Dukemon_* is a desktop app intended as a fun study tool. It is a CLI-centric
(_Command Line Interface_) app that expands upon the idea of Flashcards to aid
learning in a fun and exciting way. The main program flow of *_Dukemon_* is as
 follows:

1. User creates a _WordBank_.
2. User creates _Cards_ that have a _Word_ and _Meaning_ each.
3. User populates his _WordBank_ with such _Cards_.
4. User starts the _Game_ and tries to match _Meanings_ with _Words_ within a certain Time.
5. User completes the _Game_ and reviews his performance _Statistics_.

Developed by my team and I, *_Dukemon_* transforms the basic concept of _Flashcards_
into an exciting and engaging game-like app through features such as _automatic Hints_, _Statistics_
and so much more. +
 +
Below are some *highlights* of the important contributions that I have made to the
development of *_Dukemon_*.

image::UserGuideGameSessionDiagram1.png[width="540"]

* *Added a Timer and automatic Hint feature*

** [underline]#_Brief Description_#:
*** A _live_ text and graphical countdown _Timer_ (region in yellow box above) that shows the User how much time is left. Based on the time left, _Hints_ (presented in a Hangman style)
are also automatically generated and shown to the user (region in blue box above).

** [underline]#_Justification_#:
*** This enhancement greatly improves the product as it achieves the intended goal of creating a *game-like learning environment* for the User that is fun and engaging.
*** Hints aids in learning, especially for weaker students or when trying out unfamiliar words.
*** Incremental as opposed to one-shot hints gives the User time to think, and doesn't potentially render the _Game_ too easy with hints.

** [underline]#_Highlights_#:
*** Challenging as it required *seamless integration* and *synchronization* between
the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and internal logical components in *real time*.
*** Utilized *advanced programming concepts* such as _Observer Patterns_, _Callbacks_ and _Functional Programming_ to preserve quality
and structural integrity of existing code base. API like `java.util.concurrent.CountdownLatch` and `java.lang.reflect` were used to run tests for _Callbacks_ and
the _Timer_ effectively.
*** Integrated external _TestFX_ library to allow for testing of _Timer_ and other components that run on the _JavaFX Application Thread_.

** [underline]#_Credits_# _(Framework/Libraries used)_:
*** https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX 11] (GUI), https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] (Testing), https://github.com/junit-team/junit5[JUnit5] (Testing)

* *Implemented and designed the _Game_ logic, UI and Difficulty.*

** [underline]#_Brief Description_#:
*** The _Game_ is a primary feature of the app where the User makes guesses for _Words_ based on a _Meaning_ shown. Different _Difficulty_ modes are available that changes the time allowed per question.

=== Game Commands image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]
(Available in Game mode)

.UI regions that are relevant when a Game session is in progress.
image::UserGuideGameSessionDiagram1.png[width="540"]


This section covers the actions and feedback that are relevant to the _Game_ mode.  The general layout of the UI when a _Game_ is in progress is as seen above.

1. The timer will be activated to reflect the time left before the _Game_ skips over to the next card. (region in yellow box)

2. The _Meaning_ of the current _Card_ is shown in the region contained by the red box. Based on this _Meaning_ you will  make a _Guess_ for the _Word_ it is describing.

3. _Hints_ (if enabled) will be periodically shown as time passes (region in the blue box) in a Hangman-style. The number of hints given
differs across each _Difficulty_.

==== Game Mode - [underline]#Starting# image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]

The relevant command(s) are:

1. *Starting new game session:* +
Format: `start [EASY/MEDIUM/HARD]`

- Starts a game session with the currently selected _WordBank_ and specified _Difficulty_.
(_WordBank_ selection is done in _Home_ mode.) If no _Difficuty_ is specified, the default _Difficulty_ in _Settings_
will be used.


==== Game Mode - [underline]#Playing# image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]

.Timer and feedback for each Guess during a Game session. (Timer changes color based on time left).
image::UserGuideGameSessionDiagram2.png[width="790"]

The relevant command(s) are:

1. *Making a _Guess_ for a _Word_*: +
Format: `guess WORD`

- Makes a guess for the _Word_ described by the currently shown _Meaning_. (*non case-sensitive*)

2. *Skipping over a _Word_:* +
Format: `skip`

- Skips over the current _Word_. (*is counted as a wrong answer*)


==== Game Mode - [underline]#Terminating & Statistics# image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]

.Comparison of UI Regions between Game finished vs. Game forcibly stopped.
image::GameFinishedGameStoppedComparison.png[width="850"]


A _Game_ finishes when *all _Cards_ have been attempted*. _Statistics_ are
*automatically shown* upon completion of a _Game_ (see Fig. 6 above). The user can choose to `stop` a _Game_ before it has finished- *all current _Game_ progress is lost*, and
*no _Statistics_ are collected* (see Fig. 7 above). +
 +
The relevant command(s) are:

1. *Stopping a _Game_ (before it has finished)*: +
Format: `stop`

- Forcibly terminates the current active _Game_ session.

=== [underline]#Timer-based Features#

==== Implementation Overview - Timer

The `Timer` component utilizes the `java.util.Timer` API to simulate a stopwatch that runs for each `Card` in a `Game`. It relies on
using _Functional Interfaces_ as _callbacks_ for the TImer to periodically notify other components in the system without directly holding a reference to those
components.

Internally, the `Timer`
works by using the method `java.util.Timer.schedule()` that schedules `java.util.TimerTasks` at a fixed rate (_every 50ms_).

An _Observer Pattern_ is loosly followed between the `Timer` and the other components. As opposed to defining an
_Observable_ interface, the `AppManager` simply passes in _method pointers_ into the `Timer` to _callback_ when an
event is triggered by the `Timer`.

[NOTE]
To avoid
synchronization issues, all
_callbacks_ to change `UI` components are forced to run on the *JavaFX Application Thread* using
`Platform.runLater()`.

.Class diagram reflecting how the callback-functions are organized in the Timer component.
image::TimerClassDiagramCallbacks.png[width=510]

The three main events that are currently triggered by the `Timer` component which require a _callback_ are:

1. Time has elapsed, _callback_ to `AppManager` to *update and display the new timestamp* on the `UI`.
2. Time has run out (_reached zero_), _callback_ to `AppManager` to *skip over* to next `Card`.
3. Time has reached a point where `Hints` are to be given to the User, _callback_ to `AppManager` to *retrieve a `Hint`
and display* accordingly on the `UI`.

The _callbacks_ for each of these events are implemented as nested _Functional Interfaces_
within the  `GameTimer` interface, which is implemented by the `GameTimerManager`.

==== Implementation Overview - Hints

.Class Diagram showing structure of `Hints` and its relationships to other components. (Some details omitted)
image::HintsClassDiagram.png[width=620]

In order to display the `Hints` component to the user in a _Hangman-esque_ style, *string formatting* has to be performed.

* Each `Card` contains a `FormattedHintSupplier` that supplies `FormattedHints` ready to be shown to the user.
* Each `FormattedHintSupplier` contains a `FormattedHint` that is periodically updated.
* Each `FormattedHintSupplier` contains a `java.util.List` of `Hint` to update  the `FormattedHint` with.
* Each `FormattedHint` maintains a `char[]` array that it's `toString()` method uses to format the output `Hint` string with.
* Each `Hint` encapsulates a `Character` and an `Index` which the `Character` is to be shown in the `FormattedHint`.

The `Timer` component *triggers a request to update `Hints`* to the `AppManager`, who then updates and retrieves the updated `FormattedHint` from
the current `Game` via the `Logic` component.

<<<
==== Flow of Events - `Hints` Disabled

This section describes the general sequence of events in the life cycle of a single `GameTimer` object with *no hints*.

.Sequence diagram (with some details omitted) describing the flow of registering and executing callbacks between the different components
image::TimerSequenceDiagram1.png[width=690]

[NOTE]
`GameTimer` interface uses a factory method to create `GameTimerManager` instances. This behavior
is omitted in the above diagram for simplicity.

A new `GameTimer` instance is created by the `AppManager` for every `Card` of a `Game`.
The `AppManager` provides information regarding the duration in which the `GameTimer` should run for, and whether
`Hints` are enabled.

. `UI` component first registers _callbacks_ with the `AppManager`.
. When a _Game_ is started, `AppManager` initializes a `GameTimer` instance for the first _Card_.
. `AppManager` registers _callbacks_ with the `GameTimer` component.
. `AppManager` starts the `GameTimer`.
. Periodically, the `GameTimer` notifies the `AppManager` to update the `UI` accordingly.
. `AppManager` is notified by `GameTimer`, and then notifies `UI` to actually trigger the `UI` change.
. `GameTimer` finishes counting down (or is *aborted*).
. `AppManager` repeats Steps 2 to 7 for each _Card_ while the _Game_ has *not* ended.

Using this approach of _callbacks_ provides *better abstraction* between the `UI` and `Timer`.


<<<
==== Flow of Events - `Hints` Enabled

.Activity diagram of the `run()` method of an instance of `GameTimerManager` when `Hints` are enabled.
image::TimerActivityDiagramWithHints.png[width=400]

The behavior of `Timer` when `Hints` are enabled is *largely still the same.*

In the diagram as *shown above*, the internal `Timer` is started when
`GameTimerManager` calls the `.schedule()` method of its internal `java.util.Timer`, which schedules `TimerTasks` immediately,
every 50 milliseconds until the `java.util.Timer` is cancelled. The field `timeLeft` is initialized
to be the amount of time allowed per _Card_ (in milliseconds), and is updated every 50ms.

When `Hints` are enabled,
`AppManager` initializes a `HintTimingQueue` in the `GameTimer` for each _Card_. `HintTimingQueue` is a class that
contains a `java.util.Queue` of _timestamps_ (in milliseconds). `GameTimer` polls from the `HintTimingQueue` and checks against
these polled _timestamps_ to update the `Hints` provided periodically.

<<<
==== Design Considerations

There were a few reasons for designing the `Timer` this way.

|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 1**: +
Where and How to effect changes to the `Ui` and other components when the `Timer` triggers an event.
| **Holding a reference to `Ui` and other components directly inside `GameTimer` itself**: +
*_Pros:_* +
Straightforward and direct, can perform many different tasks on the dependent components.  +
*_Cons:_* +
Poor abstraction and high potential for cyclic dependencies, resulting in high coupling.

|**Using _Functional Interfaces_ as Call-backs to notify components indirectly.** +
*_Pros:_* +
Maintains abstraction and minimal coupling between `Timer` and other components  +
*_Cons:_* +
Relies on developer to register correct call-back methods with the `Timer`. Different actions need to be
implemented as different call-backs separately. Possible overhead in performing few levels of call-backs.

3+|**Why we chose Alternative 2:** +
To ensure better extendability of our code for future expansion, we felt it was important to maintain as much
abstraction between components. This is also to make life easier when there comes a need to
debug and resolve problems in the code.
 +
 ||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
 |**Aspect 2**: +
 Where and how to perform string formatting for `Hints` to be displayed.
 | **Move retrieval of individual Hint characters and all formatting outside of the Game component completely**: +
 *_Pros:_* +
Maintains immutability of each `Card` inside `Game` component.  +
 *_Cons:_* +
Breaking abstraction as higher level components should not have to deal with string formatting.

 |**Perform formatting at the lowest level possible, using a `FormattedHint` class.** +
 *_Pros:_* +
Higher level components need not know about string formatting at all, maintains good abstraction.  +
*_Cons:_* +
Individual `Game` components like each `Card` become stateful, need to make deep copies to prevent
state from carrying across `Game` sessions.

 3+|**Why we chose Alternative 2:** +
Implementing cloning of `Cards` affects other areas of code the least, and reduces unnecessary coupling. Since changes to higher level
elements can potentially affect all other components, it was safer to modify more atomic areas of code.
