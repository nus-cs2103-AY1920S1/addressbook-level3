    "description": "Network Science & Analytics is a rapidly emerging field standing at the confluence of network theory, statistical analysis and business intelligence. In our increasingly networked society, social linkages affect all aspects of our daily life. Businesses too are embedded in complex economic networks which play an important role in influencing the profitability of organizations. The past decade has witnessed a surge in availability of data from various kinds of networks. The goal of this module is to introduce students to this field through a combination of network fundamentals, hands-on experience with computational techniques and datasets, and exposure to business applications.",
