    "description": "Many feel that the current level of income inequality is unfair and that capitalism is not functioning well for a vast majority of the population in several countries. Yet, some amount of inequality is inevitable as different people make different contributions in society. This begs the question: what is a fair level of inequality? This module synthesizes concepts from economics, political philosophy, game theory, information theory, systems engineering and statistical mechanics to provide a mathematical framework to analyse the income inequality problem and suggests options for tax policy, social programs and executive compensation.",
