    "description": "The political realm is often taken to be distinct from the sphere of religion in modern society, but this is by no means necessarily the case. In the Western tradition of political thought, for example, we frequently find that political ideas are embedded in a religious context or even have their origins in religious beliefs. Yet until fairly recently the canonical works in political thought were read from a secular point of view. This course restores religion to its central role in political thought, and explores its continuing relevance in a contemporary context.",
