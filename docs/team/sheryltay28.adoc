== PROJECT: Teacher's Notebook

---

== Overview

Teacher's Notebook is an application for teachers to organise their classes and lessons as well as provide reminders when their lessons are about to start.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added Lessons and Reminders to the app.
** What it does: Allows user to add, delete, find or edit lessons. A reminder will be scheduled whenever a new Lesson is added.
** Justification: Since lessons are an important part of a teacher's daily work schedule, being able to add lessons and reminders will be useful for the teacher to keep track of what lessons they have.
** Highlights: Reminders will be automatically added whenever a new Lesson is added and when the application is being closed and open, it will still be scheduled.
** Credits: Command for Lessons are inspired by AddressBook3 commands for contacts.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added tabs to GUI to display lessons by the day of the week.
