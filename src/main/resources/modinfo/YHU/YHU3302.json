    "description": "This course examines how Latin American writers, from the colonial period to today, have engaged indigenous identities and epistemologies in their work. Anchored by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\u2019s Royal commentaries of the Incas (1609), which in part seeks to reconcile the author\u2019s dual identity as both Inca and Spanish, we will follow subsequent literary movements\u2014Romanticism, indigenismo, antropofagia, and magical realism\u2014as they endeavour to represent in form and content the hybrid quality of Latin American reality. All texts will be read in translation, although students with Spanish and/or Portuguese proficiency are encouraged to read texts in their original languages.",
