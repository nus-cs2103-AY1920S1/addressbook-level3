    "description": "This module focuses on the critical study of games and play. Drawing on concepts from a range of disciplines, including play theory, cultural analysis, communication, game design, game studies, film studies, and literature, students will examine the nature of games, the act of playing, and the broader social and cultural significance of games. In addition to readings of academic texts related to games, students will also be expected to play, critically analyse, and design both computer and non-computer games. Seminars will involve screenings, play sessions, student-led discussion and analysis of games and associated critical texts, and practice-based design explorations.",
