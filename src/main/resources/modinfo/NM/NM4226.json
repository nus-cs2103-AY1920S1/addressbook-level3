    "description": "Interactive entertainment, interactive art, and humancomputer interaction (HCI) design all deal with the ways in which people interact with technology. They do so, however, from very different and often contradictory perspectives. This module explores the tensions at the intersection of these related approaches to thinking about, designing, and analyzing interactive media. Issues will be explored through a combination of case studies, theoretical discussions, and project work situated at the intersection of entertainment, art and HCI.",
