    "description": "Changing technology, commercial concerns and political and ideological agendas are asserting pressure on media players, whether they operate online or offline. Its impact can be seen in the rise of fake news intended to distort the truth or influence outcomes. A solid grounding in media ethics becomes more important in an era of changing media practices. This module deals with dilemmas that face media players, whether in journalism, advertising and public relations, with contemporaneous case studies to stimulate critical analysis.",
