    "description": "This course takes an in-depth look at how reproductive technologies are changing lives around the globe. Since the introduction of oral contraceptives in the early 1960s, the past 50 years have seen the rapid innovation and globalization of many other reproductive technologies, spanning the life course from birth to menopause. As reproductive technologies have evolved over time, so have the social, cultural, legal, religious, and ethical responses to them. This course offers exposure to the growing scholarship on the anthropology of reproduction, with special focus on ethnographies and documentaries devoted to reproductive technologies around the globe and especially in Asia.",
