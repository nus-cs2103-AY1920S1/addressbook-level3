=== [Proposed] Suggest feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The suggest mechanism is implemented through a `SuggestCommand` that extends from the abstract `Command` class. It interacts with the object that implements the `Model` interface by updating it with dishes that are within the calories budget. The calories budget is obtained from `Model#getRemainingCalories()`.

Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Model#getRemainingCalories` -- gets the current allowed calories budget.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getRemainingCalories()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the suggest mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user starts up CaloFit for the first time. The `DishDatabase` will be loaded with the initial data by calling `MainApp#loadDishDatabase`.

[NOTE]
If the DishDatabase is empty, or the daily calorie budget have exceeded the set amount, or there are no dishes that is within the amount, nothing will be display.

Step 2. The user enters `"suggest"` in the Command Line Input to invoke the `SuggestCommand` command which will run `SuggestCommand#execute()`. `Model#getRemainingCalories()` will be executed to get the remaining calories, which will provide `#Model#updateFilteredDishList` with the calories budget to update the list accordingly.

Step 3. The success message will be return, while printing the updated dish list on CaloFit.

The following sequence diagram shows how the suggest operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How suggest executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update dish list with calorie budget
** Pros: Neater code, easier to maintain and uses lesser memory.
** Cons: Unable to get history of suggest list.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new list for every `SuggestCommand`.
** Pros: Easier to understand and customise if require data for method.
** Cons: Unnecessary memory wastage for list created and not used.
* **Explanation of Choice:** Since we only need to show the user the current meal suggest, there are no usage for the past suggest result.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the suggest command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the value in a dish list.
** Pros: Commonly used, thus easier to understand and easier to deal with. It can also be easily updated.
** Cons: Would constantly require `Model` with a responsibility that is not relevant to it's current.
* **Alternative 2:** Wrap the values in a `Suggest` object
** Pros: Neater and easier to maintain, since all suggest-related values are stored in the `Suggest` object.
** Cons: Additional class to maintain, harder for newcomers to understand code with too many classes.
