== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing, or morphing an existing _address book_ application built on JavaFX for our software engineering
project.

We chose the latter, which's end product was _TravelPal_,  a desktop travelling companion application catered
for leisure travellers. _TravelPal_ allows travellers to manage their travelling itinerary, bookings, expenses and inventory
conveniently in one place, and record their travels in a *diary*.

As per the constraint given to us in developing this project, the user interacts with _TravelPal_ mainly using a command line interface (CLI),
although it has user interface alternatives for most of its operations.

My main role was to develop the *diary* feature, which allows the user to store and edit memorable details of their
trip with both multimedia and text.



== Summary of contributions

==== Main contribution 1: Implemented the diary feature.

* *What*: Overall, this feature allows the user to key in memorable details of his / her travels, and store multimedia such
as photos of the trip, displayed in a user friendly and eye-catching format.
* *Justification*: Leisure travellers often want to reminisce on previous trips they have made long after the trip,
or share its details with friends and loved ones.
* *Highlights*: Due to the large amounts of displayable multimedia, the user interface of this feature was most
challenging to implement, requiring much analysis and consideration
in striking a balance between code performance and organization. To ensure support for various forms of multimedia in the future,
the user interface implementation also had to be highly extensible.

==== Main Contribution 2: Base _address book_ code refactor

image::diary/project portfolio/forms.png[width="90%" align="center"]
* *What*: I added and updated several `ui` components, which of particular note was `ui FormItems`, a convenient and reusable
code structure to build user input forms anywhere in _TravelPal_.
I also refactored all of the `logic` code component of the base _address book_ code for team use in _TravelPal_.

* *Justification*:
Given the limited time frame of our project, it was crucial that we utilised much of the existing code to
speed our development process, and develop code components that were easily reusable.
+
In addition, although the code base given to us was extensive, much of the common functionality we had in mind for
_TravelPal_, such as the ability to switch between pages of the application, were not immediately implementable from the given _address book_ code base.

* *Highlights*: In achieving the desired functionality, it was challenging to avoid making
intrusive changes to the code base whenever possible,
as it would introduce additional burden for the team in understanding the code.

** Enhanced navigation bar icon looks https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/pull/68[#68]

* Project management:
** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/releases[releases]
** Maintained issue tracker for milestones `1.1` through `1.4` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed[issues]
* Tools:

** Set up team github organization and repo


== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|
In developing _TravelPal_, a completely new user guide was needed to provide usage instructions for the various new features.

Shown below is one of the various sections I contributed to the User Guide,
on adding a photo inside the *diary* feature.
|===

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=diary_ppp1]
NOTE: See the https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t11-4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html[user guide] for this usage scenario, not included in this project portfolio page.



== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|
In the course of this project, my team and I realised we developed a substantial amount
of code on top of the code base given to us.
Hence, my team and I updated the _TravelPal_ developer guide to better suit our needs.

Below is one of the various sections I contributed, documenting the aspect
of the diary that stores and displays photos.

== Conclusion

The constraints imposed on our development process necessitated careful deliberation and
consideration of both our product, _TravelPal_, and the changes needed to our code.
From this process, I gained many invaluable insights for future software projects, particularly in
the area of requirements analysis.

Nonetheless, using my prior experience,
I was able to contribute and implement numerous suggestions
which resulted in an extensible code base, easing the team development process.

Overall, developing _TravelPal_ proved to be both a challenging and fruitful experience for me.
