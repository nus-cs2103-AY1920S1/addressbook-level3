== Project: MyProject

== Project background

_MyProject_ is a command line desktop application that I helped design and implement as part of a
team, for a school project for the NUS School of Computing. My team consisted of 5 computing students
including me, and the task for this project was to modify a given application called the AddressBook into
our own application, that serves a different purpose. As second year university students, we have always found
it difficult to manage many different types of information across many different projects during our first
year, and hence we decided to modify the AddressBook application into _MyProject_.

== Overview

_MyProject_ is a desktop application with a command line interface, which aims to be a one-stop project
management application that will satisfy all the project management needs of a student. Our application specialises
in storing, processing and displaying the information of the projects in a meaningful way to help students
better manage their workload when it comes to dealing with multiple different projects at the same time.
_MyProject_ provides basic functionality such as storing the members, meetings and tasks of a given project,
and also storing the contact information of the members. _MyProject_ also boasts more complex functions such as
calculating optimal meeting times based on the NUSMODS timetable of each member, and also tracking the finances
of the project with different types of budgets.

A typical usage of the project looks like this:

My team worked together tirelessly to put this application together. Each of us are in charge of different parts of the
application's functionality, and my role in the team was to integrate the Person model in the original AddressBook
application into our application, and use it as a way to keep track of the member's information.

In addition to that, I also implemented a way for the application to track each member's performance in terms
of a few tangible attributes such as by keeping track of how many tasks they have done. This is to allow anyone using
the application to optimise their workflow, and better manage the progress of their project since they would know
who has done what tasks and how much each member is contributing to the team. This would also aid in more even work distribution.

In the next section, I will summarise all my contributions to the project.

== Summary of contributions

* Major enhancements: Added the performance overview functionality of _MyProject_.

** What it does: This feature consolidates all the information available, and uses it to calculate the performance of each member.
The information is stored, and displayed to the user when the the user executes the `showProjectOverview` command. The calculated
attributes of the performance is then displayed in the form of tables for easy comparison between the members. It will also show
the individual performances of each member by itself. To see a clearer view of this, you may look at my contributions to the user guide
which will be in the subsequent sections.

** Justifications: This feature allows the user to conveniently keep track of what each member has done and their
contributions to the project. This can help with distributing the workload between the members, and also helps
if there is a need to assign credit to each member for their amount of work done.

** Highlights: This feature does not require any additional storage as it is only calculated when the user requests for it,
and all the information is already available within the `Person` and `Project` objects themselves. The feature also
provides both an overview of their performances for easy comparison and a more individual view where the attributes are
grouped and listed according to each member should there be a need to check the specific member's performance. The user
also only has to type in the `showPerformanceOverview` command and everything else will be handled internally because
all the information needed is already supplied during the day to day interactions with the application when the user
`assignTask` to members and `markAttendance` for meetings. (Both of which are commands that can be executed by the user).

** Challenges: One of the challenges I faced when implementing this feature is finding a way to implement the `PerformanceOverview` model.
I initially considered making it an attribute of the existing `Project` model which my teammate implemented, however I quickly realised that
this would not be feasible, as calculating the performance of a member requires a information from both the `Project` and `Person`.
Therefore I chose to implement `PerformanceOverview` as a new model instead which created less dependencies between the
`Project` and `Person` models, and also reduced the need for the `Project` model to be associated with the `Person` model.

* Minor enhancements: I also added the functionality to keep track of the members information within the application, such as what
projects they are involved in, and the commands to add and remove members from projects. To facilitate my performance overview
functionality, I also implemented 3 more commands which are the `assignTask`, `unassignTask` and `markAttendance` command. This is
to supply the application with useful information to be used in the performance calculations when the performance overview
is requested by the user.

* Other contributions:

** Project Management:
*** Helped to report and sometimes fix the bugs which I found during the routine testing of our application.


** Documentation:
*** Did the first round of general formatting of our user guide which included fixing the inconsistent formatting, and improving
the overall organisation and style of the whole user guide. See more here -> [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T17-1/main/pull/69/files[Pull request #69]]
