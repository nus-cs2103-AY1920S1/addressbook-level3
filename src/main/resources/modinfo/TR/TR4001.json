Students from NUS, KTH, and Silicon Valley will compare and contrast the lessons of entrepreneurial leaders in all three regions. Participants will develop a personal philosophy and code of conduct for themselves as the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders. They will develop their skills as global entrepreneurs, preparing them to more effectively collaborate with entrepreneurs and members of the Circles of Influence in other high tech regions around the world. Members of all three learning groups will develop their professional global networks.",
