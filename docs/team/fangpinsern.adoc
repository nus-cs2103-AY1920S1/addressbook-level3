== PROJECT: CaloFit

== Overview

My team was tasked with improving the basic Address Book 3 (AB3) application
for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph the existing AB3
application to a calorie recording system called CaloFit which also stores a native
food database with accurate calorie information.
This enhanced application enables individuals to track their calorie intake
everyday, manage their diet and get monthly reports on their calorie consumption.

CaloFit is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application that assist users
in keeping track of their calories. It was designed with the user experience in
mind as we set to keep the number of commands to a minimum. The Graphic User Interface (GUI)
created using JavaFX displays useful information clearly to the user. To interact
with CaloFit, the user just enters a command at the top in the command box and
press the `Enter` key.

Shown below in Figure 1 is how the project looks like:

My role was to design and write the codes for the meal tracking which are the add, edit
and delete commands. The following sections illustrate my contributions to the
project as well as relevant documentations I have added to the user and developer guide
using with regards the these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates important information.

`add` - A grey highlight(called a mark-up) indicates
that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation,
and other helpful contributions to the team project

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to track consumed meals and calories*.
** What it does: Allows the user to add, edit and delete their meal entries from the meal section.
** Justification: This achieves the main goal of CaloFit which is to allow for the users to track what they consume daily
as well as their calorie intake.
** Highlights: Adding and deleting multiple meals at one go. Ability to remove specific tags of a meal instead of all tags.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide as we had to
update the original AddressBook-Level3 User Guide with instructions for
the enhancements that we had added. The following is an excerpt from our
*CaloFit User Guide*, showing additions that I have made for the `Meal Tracking`
feature. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide for the
`Meal Tracking` feature. They showcase my ability to write technical
documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
