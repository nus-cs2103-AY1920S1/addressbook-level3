    "description": "The assurance of safe and quality medicines in the market depends on a range of vital activities after the approval of a medicine by the authorities. This includes the continual monitoring offered by inspections and audits of facilities and testing of product quality. In this globalised environment, there is also an increasing need to leverage on networks to effectively detect lapses in product quality and services in a timely manner. This 4-credit module introduces the key activities and roles essential for effective post-market control, including management of failures of conformance and compliance. Topics covered will include collaborations and networks for optimising post-market communications, and handling of substandard and falsified pharmaceuticals.",
