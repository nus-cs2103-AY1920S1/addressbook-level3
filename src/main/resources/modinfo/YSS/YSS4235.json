    "description": "How does media enable religious practitioners to experience the divine in the immediacy of the 'here and now'? Prayer, liturgy, chanting, meditation, and acts of remembering to commune with higher powers, are acts that incorporate audio-visual technologies, t.v., radio, internet, religious texts, art, relics, icons, as well as so-called 'idols' and 'fetishes.' Focusing on the intersection of religion and media, students will analyze 'sensational forms,' and religious conceptions of how to properly represent the divine ('semiotic theologies'). By examining media use of several religious communities around the world, the course highlights critical aspects of religious practice and religious difference.",
