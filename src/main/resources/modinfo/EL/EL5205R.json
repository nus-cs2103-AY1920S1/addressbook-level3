Students will become familiar with the descriptive and empirical problem, examine different theoretical analyses of the syntactic phenomenon under scrutiny within a variety of linguistic frameworks, identify the theoretical consequences of alternative analyses, and engage critically with current debates in the field. Possible topics include, but are not limited to, argument realisation, binding, control, long distance dependencies, periphrastic expressions, etc.",
