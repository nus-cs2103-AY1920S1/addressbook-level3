    "description": "This seminar will explore the complex relationships between a consumerist world and the natural environment. Contemporary environmental issues, example climate change, industrial pollution, land degradation, deforestation and bio\u2010food safety have shown that capitalism is both a socio\u2010economic as well as a socio\u2010ecological system. The latter being constituted through the uneven transformation and production of 'nature' in different places. Students will appreciate how economics, politics, history and ecology have transformed our natural environment. Students will read about three readings a week. Classes will be structured such that students will grow in their ability to read, understand and critique these resources progressively.",
