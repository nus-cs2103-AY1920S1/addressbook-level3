    "description": "This module focuses on governance and political processes in South Asia. It looks at institutions, political behaviour, party systems, identities and state-society relations. It considers questions of political accountability, corruption and empowerment. It also looks at bases of authoritarianism and democracy in the region. Using a comparative framework, the module explores the diversity in political systems among different countries and analyses on-going political and economic transformations in the region. The module will enable students to think critically about the region's political architecture, and empirically analyse the positive and negative aspects of governance in South Asia.",
