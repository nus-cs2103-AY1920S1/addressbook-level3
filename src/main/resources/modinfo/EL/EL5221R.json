Among the topics covered are the grammatical features in literary texts, the sounds of poetry, and discourse situations in fictional narrative. This module will be useful for higher-degree students who want to use literature in their study, including those who have to use the language of literature for a more comprehensive examination of a particular area of linguistic research. Higher-degree literature students with a good linguistics background may also consider doing this module.",
