== Introduction
What is TravelPal? First and foremost, it is a cross-platform desktop application for those who love to plan and micromanage their travels. It includes various features to help in planning the trip beforehand, such as an itinerary planner, a pre-trip inventory manager, bookings and expense manager. During the trip, there is also an inbuilt diary application that allows the user to record details of the trip, and a contacts manager to store important contacts related to the trip. In addition, it’s primary preferred form of input from the user is the Command Line Interface (CLI), but it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for those who like to use alternative inputs, such as a mouse. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Features

====
*General Command tips*

* Most commands are in the format of <command> <argument1> <argument2> <...>.
** <command> is case insensitive, so typing it in any combination of UPPER_CASE or lower_case will work.
** When an argument is optional, it will be tagged be enclosed in square brackets [...] instead of angle brackets <...>
** When required, a separator / delimiter between arguments will be displayed with *separator*.
* Commands support tab-autocomplete when appropriate.
** Autocompletion for commands : For example, typing he then pressing tab will autocomplete the command to help.
**Autocompletion for separators : When a command requires a separator, and the command name is already in the text input, pressing tab again will append the separator automatically.
* Commands help popup
** Once the command name is already in the text input, a handy, non-intrusive popup will appear slightly above the text input.
** You can disable this feature in the user preferences.
* Leading and trailing white spaces in the inputted command are ignored.

=== Diary

==== Introduction

Welcome to the diary feature of _TravelPal_! The diary allows you to key in various thoughts and add photos that tie
to each day of the trip. It offers a selection of formatting choices for your text display, and has an
additional gallery display to the right that allows you to take a glance at all your photos quickly. Moreover, for almost
every command, there are gui alternatives that allow you to execute the same operations.

This section of the user guide explains how to use the diary.

==== Diary User Interface Overview

Shown below are the key elements of the diary page, while the gallery is in view.

NOTE: There is an alternative mode of display (which will be touched on shortly, or see <<diary_editor_display_mode>>),
that shows when you execute the `editor` command <<diary_editor_command>> or click the `Edit` button.

image::diary/userguide/welcome_to_diary_image_annotated.png[title="Overview of diary user interface"]

===== Diary Entry Display Area
This is the main display area of your diary entry. It is able to display text, along with inline images, or just lines of
images. The content is generated from the diary text of the entry (<<diary_text_info>>).

[[diary_gallery_display]]
===== Gallery Display
The gallery allows you to browse through your stored photos. You can scroll the list simply with your mouse wheel.

image::diary/userguide/diary_photo_user_interface.png[title="Display of a photo in the gallery display"]

Each image is displayed with a description (bottom left), a date taken (top right), both of which are user specifiable.
There is also a photo index
(top left), which is for use in various commands (see <<diary_text_displaying_images>>).

[[diary_current_day_indicator]]
===== Current Day Indicator
This is simply some helper text for you to know what day the diary entry you are currently viewing is tied to.

[[diary_day_navigation_bar]]
===== Diary Day Navigation Bar
This is the button equivalent of the `flip` command (<<diary_flip_command>>), and allows you to navigate between your
diary entries for different days by clicking on the respective buttons.

[[diary_gallery_button_bar]]
===== Gallery Button Bar
This smaller button bar is used for executing two other commands. Firstly, the `editor` (<<diary_editor_command>>)
can be executede by clicking on the _Edit_ button. Secondly, the `addphoto` command may be executed
(<<diary_addphoto_command>>) through _Add_ button.

[[diary_add_new_entry_button]]
===== Add New Entry Button
Similarly, this button executes the `create` command through the user interface, as described in <<diary_create_entry_command>>.

[[diary_editor_display_mode]]
==== Diary Editor User Interface

This is the screen that shows when the `editor` command (<<diary_editor_command>>) is executed or the _Edit_ button
is clicked, as mentioned in <<diary_gallery_button_bar>>.

Components not highlighted in <<diary_edit_view_annotated>> below function the same way as mentioned in
<<Diary User Interface Overview>>.

[[diary_edit_view_annotated]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_edit_view_annotated.png[title="Overview of diary user interface when the edit box is shown"]

===== Diary Edit Box
This is the text edit area that allows a convenient form of alternative input to commands for editing the Diary Entry.
While you may feel that the special clauses _"<images 2>"_ and _"<images 5 1 3 4>"_ being used in the diagram above are
rather unfamiliar, they are actually quite simple! (see <<Diary Text>>).

TIP: For the command line input savvy users, you can use the `F1` accelerator to quickly move your keyboard focus
back to the command line input!

===== Commit Edit Button
This is simply the button-equivalent of the `done` command (<<diary_done_command>>), and allows you to commit the
changes you made (either through commands, or directly in the edit box) while the edit box was open.

[[diary_text_info]]
==== Diary Text

The **diary text**, as you edit in the edit box (<<Diary Edit Box>>), or edit through the commands described in
<<Diary Commands>>, are one and the same **diary text!** Hence, any commands you input to edit the text are reflected into
the edit box automatically, and any edits you make to the edit box are considered by the commands.

The diary text consists of *paragraphs*, which are simply texts separated by new line / return characters.

NOTE: A paragraph of text need not span a minimum length, and can even be empty, as seen in the empty orange boxes
in <<diary_text_line_numbering_figure>>

Additionally, the diary text can use special clauses to display and format images, as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.

[[diary_text_line_numbering]]
===== Diary Text Line Numbering
Each **paragraph** of text as seen in the edit box or diary entry display (with optional accompanying image(s)) is tied to a
specific **line number**. This **line number** is simply determined by the order of the text paragraphs as shown
in <<diary_text_line_numbering_figure>>, from top to bottom.

[[diary_text_line_numbering_figure]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_what_is_a_paragraph.png[title = "Annotated highlights of paragraphs and their line numbers with alternating colours"]

This **line number** is used for several commands described in <<Diary Commands>>.

NOTE: It is trivial if using the edit box to edit text, as text editing is done directly on the **diary text**.

[[diary_text_displaying_images]]
===== Displaying images
There are currently two main formats in which you can display images inside the diary entry display.

Both of them use simple clauses that require the numbering of the photo as displayed in the gallery.

====== As a mini horizontal gallery of images.
** Format: Use a diary **text paragraph** consisting of only the clause `<images number1 number2 numberN>`, where `numberN`
is the index of the photo as displayed in the gallery (<<diary_gallery_display>>).
** Example: `<images 5 1 3 4>` - displays a mini gallery with the images 1, 3 and 5 as shown in the gallery.

image::diary/userguide/diary_mini_gallery_edit_box.png[]

====== As an inline image with an accompanying paragraph of text.
** Format: Use a diary **text paragraph** consisting of your desired text, along with the clause
`<images numberN>`, where `numberN` is the index of the photo as displayed in the gallery <<diary_gallery_display>>.
** By default, the clause will place the image on the right, and the text on the left. You can include the `'left'`
word inside the `<images left numberN>` clause as such to reverse the order.
** Sample usage:

image::diary/userguide/diary_mini_gallery_edit_box.png[]
// end::diary_ppp[]

==== Diary Operations

The diary commands follow the same general format used by the rest of `TravelPal`.

[[diary_create_entry_command]]
===== Creating a diary entry
To start, you would want to create a new diary entry for a certain day. There are two options,
the former being the `create` command which offers slightly more flexibility.

====== Using the `create <dayN>` command
* Usage: Creates a new diary entry for *any* specified day number.
* Arguments:
** `<dayN>` - Positive integer nth day of the trip, which has not yet been created.

[[diary_create_entry_command_button]]
====== Using the add entry button `+`

* Usage: Creates a new diary entry for the day right after the latest day's entry you currently have.

'''
====== Example Usage

Scenario: You already have entries for days 1 up to 8, and you want to create a new entry for day 9.

. Type in the `create 9` command in the command line input, then press enter, or simply click the `+` button as shown
below.
.. For the add entry button `+` (<<diary_create_entry_command_button>>), since the current latest day's entry is day 8,
it would create an entry for the day right after that, which is day 9.
+
[[diary_create_entry_command_before]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_create_command_with_button.png[title="Example usage of creating a new diary entry for day 9"]

. That's it! the diary entry will be successfully created, and you will be brought to the new diary entry's screen without
having to navigate to it via <<diary_flip_command>> automatically.
.. The edit box will also be opened automatically, as shown below, and you can start editing with it right away!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_create_command_command_after.png[title="Example result of post diary entry creation"]

[[diary_flip_command]]
===== Navigating to a diary entry
Next, say you wanted to view or edit a different day's diary entry, be it during your trip, or long after the trip. There
are also two options here to suit your needs, both offering the exact same functionality.

====== Using the `flip <dayN>` command
* Usage: Flips the diary to the diary entry of the day number specified.
* Arguments:
** `<dayN>` - Positive integer of the nth day's diary entry to flip to.

====== Using the diary entry navigation bar
* Usage: Clicking the the button of with the day number of the diary entry in the navigation bar (<<diary_day_navigation_bar>>)
will flip to the diary entry for that day.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario: You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 9, which is empty, and you want to view the diary entry for day 3.

. You should type in the `flip 3` command in the command line input, then press enter, or click the navigation button `3` for
day 3, as highlighted below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_flip_command_with_button.png[title="Example usage of flipping the diary to day 3's diary entry"]

. That's all! You will be brought to the entry for day 3, as shown below. You should see a brief confirmation message in
the command result box, and that the current day indicator will update accordingly (<<diary_current_day_indicator>>).

image::diary/userguide/diary_flip_command_command_after.png[title="Example result of after flipping back to the diary entry for day 3"]

// tag::diary_ppp2[]
[[diary_addphoto_command]]
===== Adding a photo
If you have just created a fresh diary entry, and you're wondering where to go next, then you
may want to start by adding your photos to display in the gallery (<<diary_gallery_display>>).

Here, there are up to 3 options for you to choose, the last option being the least flexible but also the fastest, if
you are more comfortable with the using the user interface than the command line input.

NOTE: In all options, the image file chosen should be of the file types `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`

====== Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix
* Usage: Typing in the command `addphoto fp/<file path> [d/<description>] [dts/<date taken>]`, with the
arguments described below, will add the image file located at the specified file
path on your computer to the gallery display.
* Arguments:
** `<file path>` - Relative file path from the location of the _TravelPal's_ jar file, or an absolute file path.
** `<description>` (optional) - The description of the photo to be shown in the gallery, of maximum length 20.
If left unspecified, the file name, truncated to the maximum length is used instead.
** `<date taken>` (optional) - The date taken of the photo, of the format d/M/yyyy HHmm.
If left unspecified, the last modified date of the file is used instead.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario:

* You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 1, which is empty, and you want to add a new photo.
* You are also a command line savvy user that loves and understands how to manually specify relative or absolute
file paths (see <<glossary>>), hence you opted for this option,
rather than <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix>> or <<Using the `add` button under the gallery display>>.
* Also, you want to give the photo a custom description, but want to use the last modified date of the image file in your
computer as the date taken for the photo. Shown below is an example of the photo on your computer you want to add,
`snowymountains.jpg`, that is located in the same place as the _TravelPal_ application.

image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_filepath_directory.png[title="Example file directory structure of the TravelPal application and snowymountains.jpg"]

. You should type in the `addphoto fp/snowymountains.jpg d/picturesque mountains` command in the command line input, then press enter, or click the navigation button `3` for
day 3, as highlighted below.
.. Here, the relative `<file path>` is simply the name of the file, `snowymountains.jpg`, since the image file is located in the
same directory as the _TravelPal_ application.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filepath.png[title="Example usage of the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` option"]

. The photo, with the specified description and last modified date will be added. You should see a brief confirmation message in
the command result box.
.. Additionally, there will be a auto-generated photo numbering, for use as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.

image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filepath_result.png[title="Example result of after executing the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` option"]

'''

====== Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix
* Usage: Typing in the command `addphoto fc/ [d/<description>] [dts/<date taken>]`, with the
arguments described below, will add the image file located at the specified file
path on your computer to the gallery display.
* Arguments:
** `fc/` - opens your system's user interface dialog to allow choosing an image (of file types `.jpg .jpeg .png`).
** `<description>` & `<date taken>` (optional) - as described in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix>>.

NOTE: The `fc/` prefix takes precedence over the `fp/` argument if both are specified.

====== Using the `Add` button under the gallery display
* Usage: Clicking the `Add` button located under the gallery display area (<<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will open your
system's user interface dialog to choose an image file.
* If this option is used, then the `<description>` & `<date taken>` are not specifiable and will be auto generated as described
in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix>>.

'''
====== Example Usage for `addphoto` command with `fc/` option or `add` button

Scenario:

* You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 1, which is empty, and you want to add a new photo using your system's
file choosing user interface, leaving the
application to generate the `<description>` and `<date taken>` fields automatically.
* Also, the image file you want to add is `snowymountains.jpg`, and is not located in the same place as the _TravelPal_ application.

. You can type in the `addphoto fc/` command in the command line input as highlighted in yellow below, and press the 'enter' key,
or you can click the `Add` button.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser.png[title="Example usage of adding a photo through the `addphoto` command using the `fc/` option, or the `Add` button"]

NOTE: In this example, the `<description>` and `<date taken>` fields are automatically generated. However, if you are using
the `addphoto fc/` command, you may specify them manually as described in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix>>

[start=2]
. Your system's file chooser user interface, which may look different depending on your operating system (windows / mac / linux) (see <<glossary>>)
will be opened, as shown below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_step2.png[title="Example file chooser user interface for the windows operating system"]

. Next, you can simply use the file chooser user interface to choose an image located anywhere on your computer!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_step3.png[title="Example image file in the file chooser user interface to add"]

. That's it! Your photo, with the auto generated image name and date will be placed into your gallery, and you will see a
confirmation message in the result display.
.. Additionally, there will be a auto-generated photo numbering, for use as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_result.png[title="Result after choosing the image 'qidu_marketplace.jpg' in step 3"]

===== Deleting a photo
If you mistakenly added a photo to the wrong diary entry, or want to remove a certain photo from an entry, you can
use the `delphoto` command to do so.
// end::diary_ppp2[]
====== Using the `delphoto <photo number>` command
* Usage: Deletes a photo, indicated by the specified photo number, as displayed by the photo's numbering in the gallery.
* Arguments:
** `<photo number>` - Positive integer number of the photo to delete, as shown by the numbering in the gallery (see <<diary_gallery_display>>).

'''
====== Example Usage
Scenario: You mistakenly added the photo 'qidu_marketplace.jpg' to your diary entry for day 1 when it should have been
added the day 2's diary entry.

. You type in the `delphoto 1` command to delete the image with the same `1` numbering as shown in the gallery, and
press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delphoto_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `delphoto` command to delete the photo with number 1"]
