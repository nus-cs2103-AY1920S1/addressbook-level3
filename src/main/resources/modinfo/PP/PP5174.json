    "description": "That international politics can be conceived as a game with its own special rules is a truism for most analysts of the subject. Yet there does not exist a list of what the rules of the game are. This course will examine a list of ten possible contenders for inclusion in the list. The class will debate and dissect these 'rules,' with the aim of arriving at a mutually agreeable and defensible list of the key rules of the international politics game by the end of the semester.",
