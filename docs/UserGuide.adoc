== Introduction

FlashCard Pro is an application designed for students of all fields who prefer to use a desktop app for managing flashcards, as well as teachers who would like to provide resources (in the form of custom flashcard decks) to support their students’ learning.

FlashCard Pro is optimised for users who are comfortable with Command Line Interface-based interaction, allowing them to work more efficiently than with traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based flashcard apps, while still being able to use their flashcards in a familiar GUI format.

== Flashcards

What is a flashcard? Flashcards are containers for information. Each card has a “front” and a “back”. Although FlashCard Pro is agnostic in its implementation, one recommended use case is such: the user stores a question on the “front” of the card and the answer on the “back”.

After sets of flashcards (known as “decks”) have been created, the user may interact with the flashcards in various ways. For example, FlashCard Pro can be configured to show the “front” of the card, prompting the user to enter their guess for what is on the “back” of the card. The user’s attempt is gauged “correct” if it matches the definition of the card.

As with physical flashcards, the flashcards in FlashCard Pro can be shuffled, used in reverse, mixed between decks, etc. Unlike physical flashcards, flashcards in FlashCard Pro are dynamic, offering a range of possibilities from traditional memorisation-type uses to support for learning programming. For example, teachers may define basic coding problems which their students can attempt to answer. FlashCard Pro will evaluate the output of the student’s solution, allowing students to gauge their own coding knowledge, and teachers to evaluate their students’ progress.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashcardpro.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app
