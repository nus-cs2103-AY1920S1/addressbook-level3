    "description": "This course has two primary objectives. The first is to introduce students to the fundamental elements of civil litigation. The second is to inculcate a sound understanding of the underlying principles and policies of civil justice. This will provide students with an analytical approach to litigation and set a foundation for practice. The Rules of Court and related sources of civil procedure will be examined as we go through the various stages of the lawsuit. Students will learn that the civil process is primarily characterised by a variety of initiatives which may be taken according to the circumstances of the case.",
