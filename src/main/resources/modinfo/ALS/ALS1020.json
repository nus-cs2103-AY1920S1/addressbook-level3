    "description": "Have you ever regretted a choice you made? Every day, we make many decisions. However, are you aware that we all possess cognitive biases that influence our choices without us knowing? These natural biases can lead us into making seemingly prudent decisions that are illogical. In this module, we will explore some of the biases that we are naturally programmed. You will understand why we don\u2019t even realize that we behave irrationally and make choices that are unintended. With a better knowledge of these inherent natural biases, we can think more clearly and make better decisions in our lives.",
