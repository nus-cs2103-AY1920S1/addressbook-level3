== Introduction

ORGANice is a desktop application for hospital administration staff +
to manage organ transplants.
With ORGANice, you can easily do the following:

* organise information about patients, doctors, and donors
* find matches between organ donors and patients


ORGANice is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) +
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, +
ORGANice can get your administration tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? +
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Below is a list of things to do to use the application:

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. +
If not, install it link:{javaURL}[here].
.  Download the latest `organice.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the jar file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The application should appear in a few seconds. The following screenshot +
is a sample of how the application looks like:

[[Features]]
== Features

The following section describes the list of features and commands
in this application. +
 +

The list below how the format of the commands should be interpreted:

====
*Command Format*

* The first word in a command is the command word. The rest of the words are parameters, which
are either compulsory or optional. +
e.g. in a command `add n/**NAME** p/**PHONE**`, `add` is the command word while `n/**NAME** p/**PHONE**`
are parameters.
* Words in bold are the parameters to be supplied by the user +
e.g. in `add **n/NAME**`, `**NAME**` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* `[attributes]` refer to all the attributes in the <<List of Attributes>>.
* Parameters can be in any order +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/**NAME** p/**PHONE**`, `p/**PHONE** n/**NAME**`
is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a patient, doctor, or donor to ORGANice with the attributes given, depending on what is specified.

There are two ways to add a person:

* Normal Add
* Add with system prompting

==== Normal Add

Normal add refers to specifying all the attributes in the command. To add, type in the following
commands to add a person:

Format for adding patients: `add t/patient n/**NAME** o/**ORGAN** b/**BLOOD TYPE** tt/**TISSUE TYPE**
p/**PHONE** pr/**PRIORITY** ic/**NRIC** d/**DOCTOR** a/**AGE**` +

Format for adding donors: `add t/donor n/**NAME** o/**ORGAN** b/**BLOOD TYPE** tt/**TISSUE TYPE**
p/**PHONE** ic/**NRIC** exp/**EXPIRY** a/**AGE**` +

Format for adding doctors: `add t/doctor n/**NAME** ic/**NRIC** p/**PHONE**`

After adding a person, ORGANice will display a form which contains the attributes of the person. Press
the Enter key to confirm the details.

[TIP]
View <<List of Attributes>> to find out what each attribute mean.

Examples:

* `add t/patient n/John Doe o/kidney b/A tt/1,2,3,4,5,6 p/98765432 pr/high ic/S9988330G
d/S2235456D a/29`
* `add t/donor n/Betsy Kim o/kidney b/AB tt/2,5,7,8,9,10 p/99998888 ic/S2345678H
exp/23-Nov-2020 a/21`
* `add t/doctor n/Lim Chu Kang p/91054444 ic/S5678908D`

==== Add with system prompting

In this mode, the user can add the person's attributes one by one.
After entering an attribute, the system will prompt the user input for another attribute.

Format: `add t/**TYPE**`

ORGANice will prompt the user to type in each attribute, one by one.

In the display box, there will be a form that reflects the attributes typed by the user.

After the inputs are added, ORGANice will display a template that shows what the user data will look like
if the changes are finalised. Press the Enter key to confirm the changes.



=== Listing persons : `list`

Shows a list of all doctors, donors, or patients in ORGANice, depending on the type of person specified.
Format: `list t/**TYPE**`

Examples:

* `list t/patient`
* `list t/doctor`
* `list t/donor`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits the information of the person with the specified NRIC to the attributes specified.
It is up to the user to specify which attributes should be updated. +

Format: `edit ic/**NRIC**`

Optional parameters: any parameter from the <<List of Attributes>>

After editing, ORGANice will display a form to show what information will be stored about
the person after confirming the changes. The user is free to edit the fields before
changes are confirmed.

Examples:

* `edit ic/S8732457G p/91234567` +
Edits the phone number of the specified patient to be `91234567`.
* `edit ic/S8732457G n/Betsy Crower b/A` +
Edits the name and blood type of the specified donor to be `Betsy Crower` and `A` respectively.

=== Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose attributes contain any of the given keywords.
A list of patient/donor/doctor's information whose attributes partially match the keywords
will be displayed. +

Format: `find`

Optional parameters: any parameter from <<List of Attributes>>


****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one attribute will be returned. +
e.g. `a/28 n/Hans Bo` will return people whose attributes are `n/Hans Gruber`, `n/Bo Yang`,
`a/28 n/Jane`

****

Examples:

* `find t/patient n/Lim` +
Returns any patient whose name contains 'Lim'


// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from ORGANice.
Match history of a deleted patient or donor with other patients/donors will be removed. +
Format: `delete ic/**NRIC**`

Example:

`delete ic/S98654322D` +

Deletes a person with the NRIC S98654322D in ORGANice.


// end::delete[]
=== Detecting matches: `match`

Currently, ORGANice only supports kidney matching. Refer to <<FAQ>> to know the
procedure for kidney matching.

This command displays a list of patient-donor pairs that passes both the blood type and tissue
typing tests. +

To get a list of patients and their number of matches, the format is: `match all/`

To get a list of potential matches a patient has with a donor, the format is: `match ic/**NRIC**`

Each match is accompanied by a success rate number,
which indicates the degree of compatibility
between the patient and donor. +
This is so that the doctors can schedule for cross matching between the patient-donor pair.

Matches can be sorted. Refer to <<Sorting matches>> for more information.

=== Sorting matches
Users can specify how they want the patient-donor pairs to be sorted. +
Sorting is done by passing in optional parameters to the `match` command. +

Matches can be sorted according to three categories:

1. Success rate of match
2. Priority of patient
3. Date of expiry of donors' organs

To return a sorted list of patient-donor pairs, include the `sort/` flag in the command. +
Format:
`match ic/**NRIC** sort/[rate/priority/expiry]`

Typing this command causes the application to display a list of matches sorted
according to the specified criteria. More than one sorting criteria can be included.

Examples:

* `match ic/S7778983D sort/rate`
* `match ic/S7778983D sort/rate, priority, expiry`


=== Processing potential matches: `processing`
//TODO: change to shorter term that captures the meaning

After finding a list of matches, the hospital is free to schedule a cross-matching test between
a specific donor and patient. +

After typing this command, the following changes occur:

* the patient and donor statuses will be set to 'under cross matching'
* the patient and donor will not be included in matching with other donor and patients until a status update.

Format: `processing icP/**PATIENT NRIC** icD/**DONOR NRIC**` +

Example:
`processing icP/S6764235G icD/S1234567D`


=== Mark as done : `done`

After the hospital has the results of the cross matching test, they can
update the results in ORGANice. Cross matching tests have two possible results: pass or fail.

Format: `done icP/**NRIC OF PATIENT** icD/**NRIC OF DONOR** res/[pass/fail]`

`icP/**NRIC OF PATIENT**` refers to the NRIC of the patient, while `icD/**NRIC OF DONOR**`
refers to the NRIC of the donor.

The following section outlines what happens based on the two results: +

If the result of the cross matching is a 'pass':

. It is up to the hospital staff to schedule an organ transplant surgery
between the patient and donor.
. Mark the patient and donor as 'done', based on the command format.
. After running the command, the system removes the patient and donor from the matching pool.
The patient and donor statuses will be marked to 'done'.


If the result of the cross matching is a 'fail': +

. Run the command based on the given format

. The patient and donor will be added back to the matching pool for
match detection with other patients and donors.

. The patient-donor pair will not be considered a potential match in future match detection.


Example:

* `done icP/S7896432A icD/S4578902G res/pass`
* `done icP/S7896432A icD/S4578902G res/fail`


=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Detecting duplicates

When adding a person, ORGANice will detect if the input is a duplicate of another person in the list.
A duplicate is defined as: Two persons of the same type who have the same NRIC.

When a duplicate is detected, ORGANice will indicate that there is such a person in ORGANice so the inputs
should be changed.

== Future improvements

This section describes features that can be added or improved in version 2.0.
It is further divided into two sub-sections: **Proposed New Features** and **Proposed Extensions**.

=== Proposed New Features

This section describes features that can be added to ORGANice in version 2.0.

==== Filtering persons: `filter`

Filters a patient/doctor/donor by specific attributes.

Format: `filter [patient/donor/doctor] [options]`

Returns a list of patients/doctors/doctors that has the specified attributes.

Examples:

* `filter t/patient g/M`
* `filter t/donor g/M n/Chua`

=== Proposed Extensions

This section describes features that can be improved on and its proposed improvements.

==== Mass addition of data

Add more than one patient/doctor/donor from data in a specified text file.

A duplicate is defined as: two persons of the same type having the same ID.
When a duplicate is detected, it prompts the user to change the data in the text file.

==== Supporting more types of transplants

Currently ORGANice has patient-donor matching for kidneys only. Future versions can include matching for +
more types of organs.

==== Processing a match: `process`

Emails the doctor in charge of a patient when an organ match for the patient is found.

Format: `process **NRIC**`

==== Advanced find

Finding in v2.0 is more advanced with the implementation of fuzzy search and partial matching of keywords.


== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file +
that contains the data of your previous ORGANice folder.

*Q*: What are the steps to find a patient-donor kidney match? +
*A*: There are three steps to finding a patient-donor match:

1. Do a blood test to determine donor and patient blood type.
2. Do a tissue typing test to determine the HLA antigens of the patient and the donor.
3. Do a cross match, which is a trial transfusion.
