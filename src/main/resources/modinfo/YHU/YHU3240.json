    "description": "This course offers an in-depth study of a significant global event of the C20th \u2013 the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5, primarily from the perspective of Japanese society at war. As the first modern war of the C20th, it acts moreover as a pre-figuring moment to World War I, where social and cultural norms of a modern society at war were shaped and negotiated. We examine a variety of translated source materials, ranging from official documents, personal letters and diaries, cultural materials (novels, Japanese prints, paintings, photographs, films), media sources (newspapers, magazines, newsreels, photographs, exhibitions), and material culture (buildings, monuments, objects).",
