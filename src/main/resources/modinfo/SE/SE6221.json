    "description": "The module examines issues of gender and sexuality in historical and contemporary Southeast Asia, and considers how key texts and theories in the field of gender and sexuality studies might be applied in the Southeast Asian context. It shows that categories of gender and sexuality have long been implicated in the formation of such dichotomous cultural paradigms as \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West,\u2019 modern and traditional, and religious and secular that continues to serve as constitutive sources of power, identity, and knowledge.",
