    "description": "Kant is widely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers, if not the greatest, and his Critique of Pure Reason is widely considered his greatest work. This course will delve into this work, entering into the intricate framework of Kant\u2019s Transcendental Idealism. Major topics include Space and Time, the Categories, the Analogies (focusing on causation) and the Antinomies (focusing on the issue of freedom). Although the course focuses primarily on Kant\u2019s metaphysics and epistemology, this grounding is expected to improve one\u2019s understanding of the basis of Kant\u2019s ethics, particularly when dealing with the Transcendental Dialectic.",
