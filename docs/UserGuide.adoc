== Introduction:

MyProject (MP) is for team leaders who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their projects.
MP is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
With MP it is a one-stop app to store and manage your projects and their relevant information,
this is especially useful if you are always managing multiple projects across different teams.
MP has unique functions such as sending emails to members within the app and financial tracking capabilities etc.
Currently our app is optimized  for students to use but we intend to expand further to working adults as well.

Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “QuickStart” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start:

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T17-1/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for MyProject.
. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
.. list : lists all contacts
.. exit : exits the app
. Refer to Section 3, “Features” for details of each command.

[WARNING]
Please do not modify the data file or corrupt it in any way. MyProject will not work as intended if you do!

== Features

[NOTE]
Parameters enclosed in square brackets[] are optional.

=== Basic Commands
Here are some basic commands to start and navigate around the app.

==== Viewing help: `help`

Provides a url to this user guide for a more comprehensive list and explanation for each command. +
Format: `help` +

==== Checkout a project: `checkout`

Checkout a project to begin working on the project immediately.

    Commands which require a project to be checked out first will be tagged using [Checkout].

Format: `checkout INDEX`

`INDEX` is the number used to identify the project in the project list.

Example:

* `checkout 1`


==== Return to previous: `back`

If you want to return to the previous view page of the app, simply type the command `back`.

Format: `back`

Example:

. `checkout 1`
. `back`

==== Exiting the app: `exit`

Once you're done with using the app, you can use this command to close the app.

Format: `exit`

=== Adding Items

This section deals with adding information to the application.

==== Add a project: `addProject`

Adds a new project into your list of projects. +
Format: `addProject n/PROJECT_TITLE s/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`

Example:

* `addProject n/CS2103 project s/Software engineering project`

==== Add a person: `add`

Adds a person to your contacts.
When you add a person to your contacts, it will automatically change to displaying your list of contacts. +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

==== Add a profile picture
Unlike other commands, we have implemented this feature to be one of the easies to use. Simply drag a picture over to the panel which the person is at, and the picture will shown as the person's profile picture in your contacts!

// tag::addMember[]
==== Add a new member: `addMember` [Checkout]

This command is similar to adding a person to your contacts shown previously, except that you have to be
checked out into a project, and the person will be added to the working project as well. +
Format: `addMember n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/address] [t/tag]...`

[TIP]
Adding a member only requires his/her name!

However it will be good to add as much information as possible.

Example:

* `addMember n/John Doe a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

* `addMember n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com t/friend`

To help you better understand how to use this command, here is a step-by-step guide, using the second example.

Step 1: You type in the `addMember` command, followed by all the information you want to store, which in this case
is her email and also her tag as a friend. With this, before you press enter your screen should look like this:

.`AddMemberCommand` user input
image::AddMemberCommandInput.png[]

If your screen looks like the picture above, just press enter and you're done! Adding a new member is just a simple
one step process.

After you press enter you will be able to see the member reflected in the project like this:

.`AddMemberCommand` success project overview display
image::ProjectOverviewAddMember.png[picture, 400]

And you will also be able to see her in your contacts like this:

.New Member displayed in your contacts as a new person added.
image::PersonListAddMember.png[picture, 400]

If you look closely at Figure 5. you will see that some of the information does not really seem right. That is because
you have not input it yet, but don't worry you can always do that later with our `edit` command which you will further down
the guide.
// end::addMember[]

// tag::addFromContacts[]


==== Add from your contacts: `addFromContacts` [Checkout]

This command helps to add a person you already saved in your contacts into your project, reducing the need
to type his information all over again. All you need to do is enter the index he is listed at. +
Format: `addFromContacts INDEX...`

`INDEX` is the number which the person is listed at, and it should be a positive integer eg. 1, 2, 3, ....

[TIP]
You can put multiple indexes to add multiple people to your project at once isn't that convenient! E.g. `addFromContacts 1 3 5`


Example:

* `addFromContacts 1`

To help you better understand how to use this command, here is a step-by-step guide.

Step 1. Find the person you want to add, and take note of the index which the person is listed at. Referring to the picture
below, let's say you want to add 'Bernice Yu' into your project. Notice her index is 2.

.Finding the person to add
image::AddFromContactsFindPerson.png[picture, 400]

Step 2. Type in the `addFomContacts` command with the index `2`

.`addFromContacts` command input.
image::AddFromContactsCommandInput.png[]

Step 3. Press enter and you're done! Refer to the picture below to see what your screen should look like.

image::AddFromContactsCommandSuccess.png[picutre, 400]

// end::addFromContacts[]

// tag::setTimetable[]
==== Set a timetable: `setTimetable`

Need to keep track of your team members' schedule? Use this command to record down their timetable easily!

[TIP]
Timetable set can be used to generate available meeting timeslots using the command `generate`

Format:

`setTimetable INDEX [n/NUSMODS_SHARE_URL] [f/FILEPATH_TO_TIMETABLE]`

****
* Assigns timetable to the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list using the command `list`.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Example:

* `setTimetable 3 f//home/john/Desktop/aliceTimetable.txt` +
Set Alice's timetable to Alice, who has index 3 in the list of persons.

[NOTE]
File should be formatted as a newline separated list of time ranges, e.g: +
MONDAY 1000 MONDAY 1200 +
MONDAY 1400 MONDAY 1600 +
TUESDAY 1100 TUESDAY 1500

* `setTimetable 2 n/https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-1/share?CS2100=LAB:05,TUT:02,LEC:1&CS2101=&CS2103T=LEC:G13&CS2105=TUT:03,LEC:1&CS3241=TUT:05,LEC:1&CS3243=TUT:01,LEC:1&GEQ1000=TUT:D27` +
Set timetable to the person with index 2 on the list of persons, by retrieving timetable data from NUSMods.

Below is a step-by-step instruction to guide you through the process of setting a timetable to Alex, through the use of NUSMods:

* Step 1: Type `list` and enter to view the list of persons. Identify the index of the person you wish to set the timetable to.

.List of person in the application
image::set-timetable/set-timetable-step-1.png[]

* Step 2: Type `setTimetable`, followed by the index of the person you wish to set the timetable to, and the URL of the share link.

.User enters timetable of team member

=== Sorting

The following section provides a set of commands which help with sorting the information inside the
application. MyProject makes it very easy and user-friendly by making all sort commands follow the same
format and index/order pairing as shown below!

****
All commands in this section follow this set of index/order pairing, where applicable:

. Alphabetical order
. Increasing order of time
. Whether tasks are done
. Whether tasks are done and then by increasing order of time
. Increasing price
****

[NOTE]
The default sorting order for the following lists is by increasing order of time(index 2). Whenever MyProject
is closed, the ordering will return to the default order.

==== Sort tasks: `sortTask` [Checkout]

This command sorts the tasks in the task list of the current working project. +
Format: `sortTask INDEX`

`INDEX` refers to the index of the list provided in the highlighted section above which corresponds to the type of sorting you wish to apply.
For example, index 1 corresponds to sorting by alphabetical order. For the case of sorting tasks, only numbers between 1 and 4 are applicable.

Example:

Let's say you have added many different tasks with different deadlines and progresses into MyProject. +

The default sorting order that MyProject offers is by increasing order of time(index 2). However you wish to group those tasks that are done in one group and those not done in another group and
then further sort each group by increasing order of time(index 4) to track the progress of your tasks. +

Simply type in the command `sortTask 4` and all the tasks in the list will immediately be sorted accordingly. +

In addition, whenever you add a new task(Section 3.2.4) or edit the details of an existing task(Section 3.3.2), MyProject will automatically insert
the newly added or edited task into the correct position based on this new sorting order so you don't have to continuously type this command whenever
you wish to add or edit tasks! +

Here is a step by step process on how to do this.

. Firstly, since this command is labeled with [Checkout] at the start, ensure that you `checkout` to a project first.
Notice how the tasks in the task list are currently at the default sorting order which is by increasing order of time.
image:sortTask1.png[]

. Next, enter the command `sortTask 4` into the command line and press enter. You can choose any index from 1-4 depending
on which type of sorting order you wish to sort by based on the specifications provided in the highlighted section above.
image:sortTask2.png[]

. The following success message will be displayed if the input was entered correctly. Check that the type of sorting
displayed in the success message is the one you actually wanted. +
The tasks in the task list will then be immediately sorted accordingly as shown in the white box.
image:sortTask3.png[]

. Now let's say the deadline for task 2(Do UG) is pushed forward by a week and you've just completed it. Type in the command
`editTask 2 d/ c/04/12/2019 0000`(check out section 3.3.2 for more details on the editTask command) into the command line and press enter. +
The task will be edited accordingly and immediately be sorted into the correct position as shown below.
image:sortTask4.png[]


==== Sort spending: `sortSpending` [Checkout]

Sorts the spending in the budget list of the current working project based on given specification. The implementation is
slightly different from sortTask. MyProject will not show you the list of spending immediately after entering
the command `sortSpending`. Enter the command `listBudget` to view the newly sorted list of spending. +
Format: `sortSpending INDEX`

`INDEX` refers to which type of sorting you want to do. In this case, only integers 1, 2 and 5 are applicable.(Refer to the highlighted section above)

Example:

* `sortSpending 5` (Sorts the spending by increasing prices)

==== Sort meeting: `sortMeeting` [Checkout]
Sorts the meetings in the meeting list of the current working project based on given specification. The implementation is
exactly the same as sortTask. Refer to the sortTask section for a more detailed explanation. +
Format: `sortMeeting INDEX`

`INDEX` refers to which type of sorting you want to do. In this case, only integers 1 and 2 are applicable.(Refer to the highlighted section above)

Example:

* `sortMeeting 1` (Sorts the meetings by alphabetical order)


=== Finance

Imagine today you just attended the Budget meeting
and your Organization is kind enough to provide you with
budgets for your event! How delightful! What’s better is
that you can record this information in MyProject!

==== Add budget: `addBudget` [Checkout]
Let's say the organization gave you budgets on equipment and
manpower, let's first add these budgets to the project.

Format: `addBudget [b/NAME_OF_BUDGET ex/AMOUNT_OF_BUDGET]`

image::addBudget.png[]

After adding the budgets, we will be able to see a summary of
them at project overview. Currently it only shows the amount
remaining which is the same as the amount you typed just now
because you haven't spent anything yet.

image::projectOverview.png[]

==== Add expense: `addExpense` [Checkout]

Format: `addExpense [INDEX_OF_BUDGET] [s/DESCRIPTION] [ex/AMOUNT SPEND] [c/dd/MM/yyyy HHmm]`

One month later...

Now you have gone through quite a few meetings with the planning
committee and made some orders online and receive some invoices,
what's next? To record all these expenses, simply use the command
addExpense to add it under the budget. In order to do that, you
need the index of the budgets which you may already forgot, but
you may simply type listBudgets to view them again.

<<<<<<< HEAD
image::addExpense.png[]

==== List budgets: `listBudget` [Checkout]

List information about the budgets. +
Format: `listBudget`

In the diagram below, you are seeing the pie chart representation of the budgets.
It will usually show all the expenses made and the amount remaining for this budget.
However, if you have already overshot the budget, the pie chart will show
overshot instead of remaining to remind you!

image::listBudget.png[]

After all that have been done, a breakdown of the budget situation
will be available at the project overview with a stacked bar graph
indicating the amount remaining and the amount spent.

image::projectOverviewFinal.png[]

==== Excel sheet storage

Keeping the planning committee updated regarding budget is always
a challenge isn't it? Fret not, MyProject is here to help! Every update on
the budget information will be recorded in an excel sheet located
in the budgets folder. It creates a sheet per project and display
the budgets and expenses under the budget in a table form. You
can easily send this comprehensible document to your team members
to update them!

image::excelSheet.001.jpeg[]

// tag::performanceTracking[]
=== Performance tracking
Knowing that it is hard to keep track of what every needs to do, or has done so far, MyProject gives you a simple
way of tracking the performance of each member as well. The following section will give you all the details you need
to know about this feature.

==== Assigning a task: `assignTask` [Checkout]
This command allows you to assign a task to one or more of your members in the project. +
Format: `assignTask TASK_INDEX PERSON_INDEX...`

`TASK_INDEX` refers to the index at which the task is displayed at.

`PERSON_INDEX` refers to the index at which the member is displayed at. (You can input more than 1 index)


Example:

* `assignTask 1 1`

[TIP]
You can assign a task to multiple people easily just by including all of their indexes E.g. `assignTask 1 1 3 5` this assigns task 1 to member 1,3 and 5.

To help you better understand how to use this command, here is a step-by-step guide.

Step 1. Find the task you want to assign and the members you want to assign the task to, and take note of their
indexes.

==== Unassigning a task: `unassignTask`
With the ability to assign task, naturally you should be able to unassign a task as well, and you can do that with this
command. +
Format: `unassignTask PERSON_INDEX TASK_INDEX...`

`PERSON_INDEX` refers to the index of the person as displayed in your contacts

`TASK_INDEX` refers to the indexes of the tasks as displayed under the specific person

Example:

* `unassignTask 1 1`

[TIP]
You can unassign one or more tasks at once from a person by specifying all the task indexes. E.g. `unassignTask 1 1 3 5`
this unassigns tasks 1, 3, and 5 from the first person.

To help you better understand how to use this command, here is a step-by-step guide.

Step 1. Identify the tasks you want to unassign and the person you want to unassign the tasks from, and take note
of their indexes.

.Finding the tasks to unassign, and the person to unassign the tasks from.

And you will no longer see the tasks reflected under the person.

==== Mark attendance: `markAttendance` [Checkout]
MyProject also allows you to mark the attendance of one or more members for a meeting. +
Format: `markAttendance MEETING_INDEX PERSON_INDEX...`

`MEETING_INDEX` refers to the index of the meeting as displayed in the project overview

`PERSON_INDEX` refers to the index of the person as displayed in the project overview

Example:

* `markAttendance 1 1`

[TIP]
You can mark the attendance of multiple people at once, just by specifying all the indexes of the persons E.g. `markAttendance 1 1 3 4`
this marks the attendance for meeting 1 for members 1, 3 and 4.

To help you better understand how to use this command, here is a step-by-step guide.

Step 1. Identify the meeting you want to mark attendance for, and the members who were present.

==== Viewing performance overview: `showPerformanceOverview`
After assigning the tasks and marking the attendance of members, you can use this command to give you a comprehensive
view of how each member is performing within the project isn't that convenient! +
Format: `showPerformanceOverview`

There are 4 attributes that we calculate for every member which constitutes their performance:

. Number of tasks completed
. Percentage of assigned tasks completed (Rate of task completion)
. Number of meetings attended
. Percentage of total number of meetings attended (Rate of attendance)

Refer to the pictures below to understand more about how we display this information in a organised manner to you.
