== Introduction

Weme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, Weme is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Weme can let you manage memes faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `weme.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Weme.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`tab memes`* : switches to the meme tab
* In the meme tab:
** *`list`* : lists all memes
** **`add`**`p/~/Downloads/meme.jpg d/Top meme` : adds a meme located at "~/Downloads/meme.jpg" with the description "Top meme"
** **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd meme shown in the meme tab
** *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `meme add p/PATH`, `PATH` is a parameter which can be used as `meme add p/~/Downloads/meme.jpg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `p/PATH [t/TAG]` can be used as `p//Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg t/cs2103` or as `p/Users/Me/Downloads/meme.jpg`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cs2103`, `t/soc t/funny` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `p/PATH d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION p/PATH` is also acceptable.
* Whenever INDEX is encountered, it refers to the index in the currently displayed list.

=== General Commands

==== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

==== Undo : `undo`

Undoes commands and tells you the command you just undid. +
Format: `undo` +
Example: `undo`

==== Redo : `redo`
Redoes previously undone commands and tells you the command you just redid. +
Format: `redo` +
Example: `redo`

****
`undo` and `redo` only supports commands that modify data in Weme. This means that commands that alter the UI (such as `find` and `list`), as well as commands that modify the staging / import list (such as `load`, `stage`) are not undoable. The following are the commands that are undoable in each tab: +
* Meme Tab: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `like`, `dislike`
* Template Tab: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `use`
* Create Tab: `add`, `abort`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`
* Import Tab: `import`

`undo` and `redo` are also global actions. This means that if you made a change in the meme tab, and changed to the template tab, when `undo` is entered, it will undo the change done in the meme tab.
