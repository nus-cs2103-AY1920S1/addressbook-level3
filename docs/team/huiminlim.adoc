== PROJECT: FlashCard Pro

== Overview

FlashCard Pro is an application designed for students of all fields who prefer to use a desktop app for managing flashcards, as well as teachers who would like to provide resources (in the form of custom flashcard decks) to support their students’ learning.

It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). The GUI is to support the user if he/she prefers using the GUI to interact with FlashCard Pro.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: expanded the *functionality and type of FlashCards*.

** Worked on parsing and validation of inputs for `create`, `add` (Front and Back flash card and Multiple Choice flash card), `edit` (Front and Back flash card and Multiple Choice flash card), `delete` CLI functionality.

** Allows the user to assign priorities to each flash card.

** Allows the creation of a random set of flash cards for the `test` function. The set of flash cards created for the test will have a proportion of high priority and low priority cards.

** Expanded the cards to support Multiple Choice cards on top of ordinary Front and Back flash cards.

** Added support for shuffling choices of Multiple Choice cards when displaying the Multiple Choice cards in `test` mode.

** Wrote JUnit tests for MultipleChoiceCard and FrontBackCard.

* Justification: This feature allows the user to explore multiple modes of learning using flash cards.

* Highlights:

** This enhancement allowed the user to have more flexibility in exploring various types of flash cards to support the usage of the `test` function.

** In addition, this feature is challenging because it requires in-depth analysis and design of the Regex parser to determine which card type (Front and Back card or Multiple Choice card) is created.
