    "description": "This course is designed to provide modern macroeconomic models which are essential in the study of economics at the graduate level. Three main parts of the course are growth theory, business cycle models, and the investigations of certain components in the aggregate demand. Topics under each part are wide-ranging: the Solow model, the infinite horizon model, overlapping generations model, and endogenous growth models are covered for the growth part. The business cycle models deal with real business cycles, the Lucas model, and New Keynesian models. Finally, consumption, consumption-based asset pricing models and investment are studied for the aggregate demand components.",
