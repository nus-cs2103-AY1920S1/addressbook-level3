    "description": "\"Comparative Business Cultures\" will approach the subject area from both the microeconomic level (organization theory and organizational sociology) and from a macro perspective: the societal settings, the legal and normative environment, and the macroeconomic and structural context within the North American, and the different European and Asian business cultures. At each step their compatibility with the concepts of globalization will be reviewed. The tutorial will deepen this study in analyzing pertinent corporate histories and biographies of important business leaders active in the different business cultures under review. The objective is to raise students' awareness of intercultural differences in business and organizational behaviour and communication at both practical and analytical level. This should be useful for future careers in globally operating corporations or international organizations. As the course is interdisciplinary in nature (covering economics, sociology, psychology and business administration), interested students from other faculties are encouraged to attend. Basic economic literacy, practical experience in business organizations and some overseas travel are a plus.",
