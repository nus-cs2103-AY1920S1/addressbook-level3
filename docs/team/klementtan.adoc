== PROJECT: TimeBook

---

== Overview

My team was tasked to work on a basic command line interface desktop AddressBook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph AddressBook to an application, *TimeBook* that makes scheduling team meetings a breeze for students.
Students can keep track of their various on-going projects and sync the schedule of their project members onto a single platform.
They can easily find common free time slot within a project group and we will suggest the closest location for everyone to meet.
With TimeBook, scheduling Project meetings will no longer be a hassle.

My role was to be the project manager and create an algorithm to compute the best location for a meeting based on the project members'
initial locations. This resolves the issue of students having to pick from the vast variety of options to choose the most suitable  venues
for project team meetings.The following sections illustrates this feature in detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my contribution to TimeBook. It includes the contribution to code base, documentation and other helpful contributions.

*Major Feature added*: I added a feature that helps project teams choose the closest location for everyone to meet. Below is a visual representation of the feature:

. *What it does*: The popup command will display a popup(Figure 2 above) with information on are the three best place
for everyone to meet during the school day. We define the best place to meet as the location that requires the least
average travelling distance. As seen above, the users will be given the top 3 location with the least average travelling
distance. They will know what the average travelling distance for each location and a picture of the location in Google
Maps.
. *Justification*: NUS is a large campus with over five-hundred different venues to conduct the project meeting.
Finding the best place to meet for a project can be a hassle as project teams the best location. This feature tackles
this issue by using Google Maps to compute an unbiased closest common location that will benefit the team as a whole.
. *Highlights*: This feature works closely with external data sources such as NUSMods API(Application Programming
Interface) to determine the initial location of the project members and Google Maps to compute the average traveling
distance. Additionally I had to apply graph theory concepts to develop an algorithm to compute the closest common location.
This feature is closely dependent on `Ui`, `Scheduling` and `NUSMods` component of TimeBook. I had to work closely
with the other group members to ensure the seamless integration of this feature into TimeBook.
. *Challenges*:
.. *Google Maps*:
... Google Maps APIs calls cost USD$10-USD$20/1000 calls. I had to minimise API calls by having a deep understanding of
Google Maps APIs and carefully designing this feature to optimise resources constraints.
... There were bugs in Google Maps API and I had to meticulously analyze the API to identify potential break points caused by them.
... Google Maps Distance Matrix API only allows for return 100 elements per call but the complete graph I had to construct
requires 10,000 elements. I had to carefully split the elements to blocks less than 100 and combine them together after the
API was called.
.. *NUS Mods*:
... Not all locations on NUS Mods were identifiable on Google Maps, I had to create a systematical approach to convert the locations
on NUS Mods to locations that are identifiable on Google Maps.
.. *Credits*: Utilized NUSMods and Google Maps API to get the necessary data for the feature.

*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub
*** Created https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE[`Issue`] and https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/blob/master/pull_request_template.md[`Pull Request`] templates for more standardization in the repository.
*** Introduced an agile planning board https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/projects/1[here]
*** Designed TimeBook https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/images/timebook_logo.png[logo] for additional branding.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote test cases for storage component and increased coverage by 4% (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/261[#261])

** Documentation:
*** Adopted https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[Open API Specification] style of documentation into the UG for
a clearer, more standardized and easier to read user guide.
**** Group each command into `tag` so that we can split explanation of the User logic into the tags explanation and the
detailed command logic into the command explanation.
*** Drew high level design diagram for `Storage` component.
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party API(Google Maps) to the project
*** Introduced Lucid Chart to the team for easy design of UML diagrams.
*** Integrated https://app.codacy.com/manual/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/dashboard[`Codacy`] into the repository.
