    "description": "When defining justice, whose perspective should be used or privileged? How are the concepts of innocence and guilt understood in different jurisprudential, political, social and religious traditions? This Junior Seminar engages these questions by considering how theoretical notions of justice interact with their practical manifestation in courts of law. Students will organize a \u2018Festival of Challenging Ideas\u2019 to work through the questions in dialogue with the broader community within and beyond Tembusu College. They will also undertake observational studies of everyday legal process in Singapore to deepen their understanding of the complexities, conundrums and constraints on justice systems.",
