    "description": "Cultural contacts between South Asia and Southeast Asia started around the 3rd c AD. Especially several South-Indian dynasties (as, e.g. the Pallavas and the Cholas), under which trade and the setting up of diplomatic ties flourished, were the main responsible forces for an early spread of Indian cultural and social concepts and values beyond South Asia \u2013 and especially to Southeast Asia. The module aims at looking at those early forms of contact between the two regions, and at providing an understanding of the concepts of 'kingship', society, religion and culture, that became shared as a consequence. We will explore how much about 'everyday life' in old times can be learned from inscriptions, and how temple-constructions and other pieces of Art can give insights into these concepts. We will also look into early trade-connections between South India and Southeast Asia (trading guilds) and into the impact of cultural influence \u2013 especially of the Chola dynasty \u2013 in the region.",
