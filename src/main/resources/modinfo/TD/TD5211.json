Product development is the key to increase the pace of product introduction to deal with shorter product lives. Concurrent engineering is explained and a practical approach to concurrent engineering is presented in the form of five principles. The influences of the product design and teams on the development cycle time are discussed. Short cycle product development processes cannot exist without proper learning loops and risk management. Finally, aspects of organizational change in implementing short cycle product development processes are discussed.",
