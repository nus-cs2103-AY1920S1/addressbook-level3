    "description": "This module offers an introduction to key issues in Korean politics. We cover the politics of both regimes on the Korean Peninsula, as well as inter-Korean relations. Although the module focuses on the domestic politics of Korea, the peninsula's politics cannot be understood without reference to the broader regional and international context. The module therefore bridges comparative polticics and international relations.",
