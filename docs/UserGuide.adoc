Excited to start using _TravEzy_? Read this section to find out how this document is structured, and what each symbol and special font style mean. We promise that this will help you to get started with using _TravEzy_ more quickly! 😊

=== Structure of this Document

There are *alot* of things that TravEzy can do. So, we have organised this document such that you can easily look for what *you* need.


We've split up this guide into the different features of our application, namely:

* Main
* Calendar

* Address Book
* Diary
* Achievements

In each of the above sections, you will be introduced to the *interface* of the feature and the *commands* that will do the menial tasks for you.

=== Reading this Document

Symbols and fanciful (okay, different) fonts are exciting, aren't they? Let's find out more about what they mean in this document!

.Symbols and fonts
[grid="rows", frame="none"]
|===
| Symbol/font | What does it mean?

| _italics_
| Italicised text indicates that the text has a definition that is specific to the application. Do look out for the definitions of these words along the way. If not, please look at the glossary in section 13).

| ``command``
| A grey highlight means that you can type the words into _TravEzy_ and it will start performing tasks to make travel easier for you

| ``MONTH``
| Uppercase letters that are highlighted in grey indicate that the word is a _parameter_.footnote:[A parameter is like a field in your regular form. Just replace it and fill it up with anything appropriate. 😊]

| ``m/MONTH``
| The slash and letter (or word) before the _parameter_ is a _prefix_. It is used to separate the current _parameter_ from other _parameters_.

| ``[m/MONTH]``
| Square brackets imply that the the stated _prefix_ and _parameter_ are optional. (This means less typing! 😆)

| 💡
| A light bulb indicates that the enclosed text is a tip.

| ⚠️
| A warning sign indicates that enclosed text is important.

Well, _TravEzy_ has got you covered. Simply inform _TravEzy_ of your schedule (your _commitments_, _school breaks_, public _holidays_ and _trips_) and _TravEzy_ will suggest periods of time when you can travel! Excited to find out more? Well... Read on!

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's calendar_ looks like:

image::calendarScreenshots/calendarInterfaceUG.png[Calendar interface,width=800]

{nbsp}

To help you easily differentiate between various types of _events_, _TravEzy_ has categorised the _events_ into four types: _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ and _trip_. Visually, _TravEzy_ also uses different _labels_ for the different types of _events_, as shown in the image above.

WARNING: The _labels_ indicate the *type* of _event_ you have for that particular day. It does not indicate the number of _events_.

=== Adding an event to your calendar: ``add``

Whew! After reading so much, it is time to find out how you can add your _event_ so that _TravEzy_ can start suggesting when you can travel! 😊

Step 3. When you click at a region outside of the pop-up, the pop-up will disappear. How neat is that?

=== Checking your availability for a trip: ``check``

Do you need to find out whether you are available to go for a trip? You can get _TravEzy_ to find that out for you (i.e. when you happen to have a _school break_/_holiday_ *and* do not have any _commitment_/_trip_).

Let's find out how!

*Format:* +
``check d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To check whether you are available on 9 December 2019,

    check d/9 m/Dec y/2019

* To check whether you are available from 9 to 20 December 2019,

****

*Step by step:*

image::calendarScreenshots/check2.png[Check result,width=600]


=== Suggesting a suitable time for a trip: ``suggest``

The end of the semester is near. It is time to look for some cheap flights🛫! However, before deciding which flight to book, you need to find out when you can travel. Need some help with that? No worries! _TravEzy_ has got you covered. 😊

How so? Just ask _TravEzy_ to suggest a suitable time!

*Format:* +
``suggest d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR] [p/PERIOD]``

*Examples:*
****
* To find out when you can travel between 9 and 20 December 2019,

    suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019

* To find out when you can travel for at least 5 days between 9 and 20 December 2019,

****

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019`` in the _command box_ and press _Enter_. +

image::calendarScreenshots/suggest2.png[Suggest result,width=600]

== Itinerary

Now that you have booked your flight, it's time to start planning your trip using _TravEzy's_ Itinerary.

In _TravEzy_, we have broken down your events into 6 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date_, _Time_, _Location_,
_Description_ and _Tag_.

For example, here is an Itinerary entry about our trip to Japan

. _Title_ -> Visit Tokyo DisneySea
. _Date_ -> 12122019
. _Time_ -> 1000
. _Location_ -> DisneySea
. _Description_ -> Remember to take pictures with the Disney Mascots!
. _Tag_ -> Priority: Critical

In the Itinerary, you will be able to add, delete, edit, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special
tasks that you can do with your Itinerary. Read on to find out more! 😊

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary looks like:

image::ItineraryInterface.png[width=800]

=== Auto-completion feature

Don't you wish there's a way to quickly type all your commands. Well _TravEzy's_ Itinerary got you covered! _TravEzy's_
Itinerary _command box_ has auto-completion function which offers suggestions based on your input.

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary auto-complete looks like:

image::ItineraryAuto.png[width=600]

1. _Auto-complete dropdown bar_. Provides suggestions to complete your command base on your current input typed in the
_command box_.

[WARNING]
The _auto-complete dropdown bar_ requires some time to sync with the input typed in the command box. Hence, give some time for
it to read the input before hitting _Enter_

=== Adding an event: ``add``

Planning to visit DisneySea tomorrow? Add some rides that you plan to take then! 🎢

*Format:*

``add title/TITLE date/DATE time/TIME [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION]``

*Example:*

    add title/Ride DisneySea Electric Railway date/12122019 time/1500 l/DisneySea

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``add title/Ride DisneySea Electric Railway date/12122019 time/1500 l/DisneySea`` in the _command box_.

Step 2. Remember to prioritize your events using the _Priority dropdown box_, to one of the 5 different priorities:

. Priority: None
. Priority: Low
. Priority: Medium
. Priority: High
. Priority: Critical

After selecting the priority for the event, press _Enter_.

image::ItineraryAdd1.png[width=600]

Step 3. The _result box_ will display the message "Processing...
Done!
Your event has been successfully added! HAND, TravEzy! :D"

image::ItineraryDelete2.png[width=600]

=== Editing an event: ``edit``

Rather than deleting an event when you have a change of plans, why not edit the details of the event instead?

*Format:*

``edit INDEX [title/TITLE] [date/DATE] [time/TIME] [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION] [tag/]``

[TIP]
If you wish to edit the tag field in the event, indicate it with the prefix ``tag/`` and use the _Priority Dropdown Box_
to select the new priority.

    edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/`` in the _command box_.

Step 2. If you indicate a change of the priority in the edit command using ``tag/``, do remember to select the new priority using
the _Priority Dropdown Box_.

image::ItineraryEdit1.png[width=600]

Step 3. The _result box_ will display the message "Updated successfully! :D
HAND, TrazEzy~"

Step 4. _TravEzy's_ Itinerary will showcase the new _event list_ with the edited event.

image::ItineraryEdit2.png[width=600]
