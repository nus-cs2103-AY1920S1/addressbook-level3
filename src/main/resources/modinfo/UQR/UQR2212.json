    "description": "Linguistics is the scientific study of language. Linguists study the range of possible human languages, how languages differ, and what they have in common, and formulate explicit and consistent theories of linguistic structures and relations. The data of linguistics are all around us, on every written page and in every conversational interaction. How do linguists who are interested in the grammar of languages collect and analyse linguistic data, and how do linguists use these data to build theories of human language? This module focuses on the theory of grammar, and examines the broader goals of linguistics and the methodology of grammatical theory by means of hands-on exploration of these processes.",
