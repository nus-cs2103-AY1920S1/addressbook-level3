    "description": "As the knowledge economy and globalization intensifies, the field of knowledge management is becoming crucial to corporate competitiveness. Knowledge Management (KM) is a relatively new subject area which is in this course conceptualized as a strategy for improving organizational performance through a set of processes, tools and incentives designed to help people create, share, and integrate knowledge. The main idea is that knowledge can be purposefully managed in order to improve knowledge transfer, its re-use, adaptation to rapidly changing environments, and the creation of innovative new products and services. Module covers: (i) basic concepts of the nature of knowledge and its creation; (ii) organizational culture and learning organisations (iii) explicit and tacit knowledge as well as knowledge artifacts; (iv) technology and its role in knowledge creation, sharing, and management; (v) the information professional and ethical considerations.",
