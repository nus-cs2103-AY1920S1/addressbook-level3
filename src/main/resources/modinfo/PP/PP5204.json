    "description": "Writing in The New York Times, Thomas Friedman encouraged policymakers to emulate the prevailing attitude in Singapore of \u2018taking governing seriously and thinking strategically\u2019. This module is a critical exploration of the basis and implications of such a claim, focusing on features of governance in Singapore that may be viewed as unique. To achieve this, such features \u2013 particularly Singapore\u2019s systematic attempt to manage risks and complexity \u2013 are discussed in the context of influential theories and models of governance. To bridge theory and practice, the module is team-taught by a top civil servant and a political scientist, both Singaporean.",
