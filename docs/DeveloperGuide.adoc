[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Statistics,*`Statistics`*>>: Generate statistics and charts. (The use of this module is covered in the Statistic Section)

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-c 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete-c 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
// tag::UiUG[]
.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabPanel` , `StatusBarFooter` etc.
`TabPanel` consists of `CustomerListPanel` , `OrderListPanel`, `PhoneListPanel` , `CalendarListPanel`
and `ArchivedOrderListPanel`
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Different changes in each tab or panel is controlled via the enum `UiChange`

// end::UiUG[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

// tag::logicDiagram[]

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

// end::logicDiagram[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

// tag::logicsequencediagram[]

.  `Logic` uses the `SellerManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer/phone/order/schedule).
.  The result of the command execution, a `String` message and `UiChange` enum is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `UiChange` enum in the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the respective panels or help/statistics window.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-c 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-c 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// end::logicsequencediagram[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `CalendarDate` object that stores date shown on the calendar panel.
* stores `Customer`, `Phone`, `Order` and `Schedule` data in a `DataBook` each.
* a `DataBook` is backed by an underlying `UniqueList` which stores subclasses of `Identifiable`
* the `Identifiable` interfaces exposes an `isSameAs` method which is used to determine if two objects have the same identity
* exposes 4 unmodifiable `ObservableList<Identifiable>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other four components.


[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `UniqueList<Tag>` in `Seller Manager`, which `Customer` / `Phone` / `Order` / `Schedule`  can reference.
This would allow `Seller Manager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each object needing their own `Tag`.
An example of how such `UniqueList<Tag>` and `UniqueList<Customer>` interacts is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Customer Book data, Phone Book data, Order Book data and Schedule Book data in json format and read them
 back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::statisticsCommand[]

=== Statistics Calculation and Chart generation feature

==== Implementation

This statistic calculation and chart generation feature extends `Seller Manager Lite` which allows seller to quickly
generate total statistics from their `DataBooks`, through the use of a `statistic`
module that handles this calculation. There is three type of statistic to be calculated and only on `completed orders`:

* `Profit`  `Cost` `Revenue`

It implements the following mode of operations:

* default mode with no date input: generates on all completed order total `profit` , `cost` or `revenue`
** The command enter by the user will be e.g for profit type `generate-s s/PROFIT`

* mode with date input from user: The statistic command takes in 2 `dates`, `starting date` and `ending date`
and generates the `profit`, `cost` or `revenue`  each `month` between this 2 dates.
** command entered by user will be e.g for profit type`generate-s s/PROFIT s1/YYYY.MM.DD s2/YYYY.MM.DD`

Here is the sequence of steps taken by SMLJ when it receives a `StatCommand`:

image::StatisticsCalculationAcitvityDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Statistics]]
===== Statistic Module
The statistic module exposes the calculation operations in the `Statistics` interface.
analogous to the output mode, there are 2 types of methods in this module, one that returns a
`String` and the other and `XYChart.Series<String,Number>`

* Methods that return a `String`:
** `calculateTotalProfitOnCompleted(...)`
** `calculateTotalRevenueOnCompleted(...)`
** `calculateTotalCostOnCompleted(...)`

* Methods that return a `XYChart.Series<String,Number>`:
** `calculateTotalProfitOnCompletedGraph(...)`
** `calculateTotalRevenueOnCompletedGraph(...)`
** `calculateTotalCostOnCompletedGraph(...)`

All methods were written using java8 Stream() feature. This is such that there are no loops in the code to make it
more readable and maintainable.

`org.apache.commons.math3.stat.StatUtils` library is used to calculate the raw data inside a `double[]`  (primitive double array).
While the current `v1.4` only use `sum` to calculate the exact `profit` , `revenue` and `cost` , `v2.0` implementation
will make use of the `linear regression` / `average` methods inside the library to generate more advanced statistics.

===== Design Considerations / Alternative designs considered

Given that the number of orders in a seller database might be scaled to be very large in the future
the main focus of this feature was to *calculate statistics only when needed*.

* Alternative design :
** To implement statistics, maintain a few running statistic
counter upon loading of the main app, update these counters/values when calculation is needed
and then display it. This implementation would have been easy to implement within the existing AB3 code
since it meant extending the `Model` class with a statistic model, than having the `UI` class to read from
this value.
*** Pros: Easy to implement on top of AB3
*** cons: Seller will be unable to obtain an instance of past statistics at each point without storing the history of the statistics somewhere, since any change in the database / models will cause the values to change

* Alternative Design (current design) :
** `Statistics` module will exist outside of the current packages and be standalone. `Logic` will handle communication with
this module from `UI`. Respective Statistics will then be obtained from `Logic` to be displayed by the `StatsWindow`.
*** Pros: Ensure that the respective tasks are properly abstracted, adhering to Single Responsibility Principle.
*** Pros: Being standalone means the way of calculating the statistics can be changed without affecting the rest of the codebase
*** Cons: `Logic` will have to handle more calls and increases its responsibilities

====== Design Decision 1:

Given that consideration, we decided that it will be the `UI` to trigger this call to `Logic` for calculation
and then display the result of that call. Thus when Statistics need to be shown, the `UI` module will query the
`Logic` for the respective data One of the motivation for this approach was to,
as much as possible, maintain the architecture that is already in place in AB3.
Furthermore, given that this feature requires date input from the user, we will need to find a way to get `UI` to send
the data to make that query to logic. For the old AB3 implementation, `CommandResult` only contains a feedback to user
with the actual changes on data done with a call to model during `execute(model)`.


====== Design Decision 2:

We decided to extend this command pattern by creating a `statsPayload` object. This object will hold the user
queries for the statistic calculation (if there is any) and be bundled along with the `CommandResult` class to the
`UI` to use in its query to logic. When the Ui executes the command to logic, the `CommandResult` is returned with
this object, which the `UI` will then use to communicate to `Logic`.The resulting change
is that the `commandResult` type will have a slightly different behaviour.

*All `commands` that
are not `statsCommand` will call the default constructor of the `commandResult` class, where there is  an
`Optional.empty()` in place of the `StatsPayload`* .

All `statsCommand` type will have call the constructor of `commandResult` class and pass the `StatsPayload` object in.
The key motivation behind this idea of a payload was to be able to encapsulate details about the calculation inside a
single object, passed it to the appropriate place to be "unwrapped" when needed. This unwrapping is done by the
`mainWindow` class in the application and subsequently the data is passed to the  `statistic` module.

A high level view of the packages working together:

image::statsOverallClassDiagram.png[width="300", align="center"]

==== Current Implementation

===== Step-by-step breakdown

Below is a more in-depth explanation at each step.

*Note that this breakdown is for the mode with date input.
For the default mode with no date, the steps are almost the same, except that
 `DefaultStatisticsWindow` is called in place of `StatisticsWindow`*

Step 1: User inputs a stats command e.g `generate-s s/REVENUE d1/2018.12.13 d2/2019.11.13`.

The commandBox executes it and the `MainWindow` runs its `executeCommand(commandText)` method.
Referring to the sequence diagram below, this results in `logic.execute(commandText)` being called and
the `statsCommandParser` parses the input from the user, returning a
`Command` object

Seen here is the sequence diagram of the first step

image::StatsCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="400", align="center"]

Step 2: the logic then calls `command.execute(command)`

When this happens, the `StatsCommand` execute triggering a call to create the new `StatsPayload`. Then this is used to
create a new `CommandResult` object and returns that to `Logic` , completing the execution of the user input command.
Seen here is the sequence diagram of the second step

image::StatsCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[width="400", align="center"]

Shown below is a quick summary of step 1-2 (Full complete diagram):

image::StatsCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="600", align="center"]

Step 3: After the logic component completes it execution and return a `CommandResult`, the `UI` will call
`performUiChanges` that handles the specific `UI` change.This then results in the `statsPayload` class being
passed to `Logic` class and subsequently the `statistics` module,
where the appropriate calculation will take place.


Step 4: `Statistic Manager` calculates the date

Depending on the input, the `Statistic Manager` will calculate the value and return that, either in the form of
a `String` or a `XYChart.Series<String, Number>`.

Step 5: with this output from logic, `Statistic Window` will then handle the diplaying of the statistic, be it in chart
form or string form. With this the feature has finished executing! Attached below is the summary for step 3-5:

image::StatisticsCalculationUI.png[width="400", align="center"]


==== Current Version `v1.4`:

Here is a screenshot of the current product:

image::StatsExampleGraph.png[width="300" align="center"]]


==== Limitations / note to developers:

Developers working on adding features to this module should take note of these limitations that we have put in place for `v1.4` of SMLJ:


* Date range starts from 1970 onwards
** Date of year input starts from 1970 onwards.
This is enough to fit our use case.
Anything lower will be rejected.

* Extension of additional Calculation methods
** To easily extend the behaviour with additional
methods to calculate, reference the current
implementation in `StatisticsManager`;
There are utility methods to help you with
extracting the relevant information from your data.

* UI Changes
** Any additional Ui Changes should be handled by the controllers for the UI classes `StatisticWindow` and `DefaultStatisticWindow`
class.

// end::statisticsCommand[]

=== Autocomplete feature

image::AutoCompleteClassDiagram.png[]

==== Current Implementation

This feature is visible in the UI as a dropdown menu when the user enters input into the command box.

===== How the UI works

The command box uses a custom `AutoCompleteTextField` which extends from JavaFX's `TextField`, which adds an additional listener for changes in the input text.
This listener reads the entire input text on each character change and performs comparisons with a predefined set of strings.
For all predefined strings that matches the input text, they are sorted according to their "closeness", and a maximum of 5 is displayed.

===== The underlying data structures

This feature was designed to display values that are currently in the `Model`.

For example, the input text `add-c n/` would display a list of `CustomerName` that already exists in the `Customer` `DataBook`.

In order to achieve this, the underlying data structure used is a directed `Graph` with every `Node` storing a reference to a set of values,
and a `Map<String, Node>` to represent outgoing edges. The keys of this map represent the possible prefixes for the next argument of the input text, such as `c/` or `e/`.

===== Design Considerations

* Dynamically updated: By storing references to a set of values that can be backed by `ObservableList` in the `Model`, whenever the user alters any data, it will be reflected in the displayed values.

* Supports optional arguments: By storing the possible prefixes as "edge weights", it is possible to represent an optional argument by having an edge to the `Node` containing its values, as well as an edge to the next `Node`.

* Infinite structure: By having a `TagNode` store a reference to itself, it is possible to endlessly display `t/` as a possible argument at the end of the input text,
which is consistent with the unlimited number of `Tag` a `Customer` can hold.


// tag::schedule[]

=== Calendar / Schedule feature
==== Implementation

===== Overview
We decided to incorporate a third party library, _JFXtras's Agenda_, to represent our schedules on a calendar for easy viewing by our users. +
The full documentation for `Agenda` can be found http://jfxtras.org/doc/8.0/jfxtras-agenda/index.html[here].

===== Calendar Panel
`CalendarPanel` is a wrapper class designed to contain `Agenda` for rendering events as a calendar. +
Here is the class diagram for `CalendarPanel`:

image::CalendarPanelClassDiagram.png[]

===== Integration with SML
- On instantiation of `CalendarPanel`, all the schedules in scheduleList will be converted to `Appointments` and then added to `Agenda` via `populateAgenda()`.
- To set the display information of the `Schedule` object, we will find its `Order` in the orderList and retrieve its index.
- Date shown on the calendar will be today's date by default.
- Adds a listener to `scheduleList`.
- Adds a listener to `calendarDate`.

===== Complementing CRUD commands
SML supports a few main `Schedule` commands:

* Add -- adds a new schedule into SML, command will be in this format: `add-s ORDER_INDEX cd/DATE ct/TIME v/VENUE [t/TAGS] [-allow]`
* Edit -- edits an existing schedule in SML, command will be in this format: `edit-s ORDER_INDEX [cd/DATE] [ct/TIME] [v/VENUE] [t/TAGS] [-allow]`
* Delete -- deletes an existing schedule in SML, command will be in this format: `delete-s ORDER_INDEX`
* Schedule -- switches the view on the panel to the week containing the date entered, command will be in this format: `schedule cd/DATE`

===== How the display works
The schedules and date in the calendar panel shows is automatically updated depending on the commands executed by the users.
For example:

* If the user adds/edits/deletes a schedule -- calendar panel will display the week with the date of the schedule.
* If the user uses the switch-s command -- calendar panel will display the week with today's date.
* If the user uses the schedule command -- calendar panel will display the week with the date requested by the user.

Changes to the schedules are made in the `Model` by editing its own scheduleList.
`CalendarPanel` listens to the changes and calls `populateAgenda()` to generate the updated list of `Schedules` into `Appointments` to add to `Agenda`.

The current date shown on the calendar panel is encapsulated in a `CalendarDate` object.
The `CalendarDate` class uses `SimpleObjectProperty` to keep track of the Calendar (date) to be displayed.

When any of the schedule commands are executed, model will edit `CalendarDate` with the updated Calendar (date).
`CalendarPanel` listens to the changes and calls `setAgendaView()` to set the new `Calendar` in `CalendarDate` accordingly.

Here is an example of what happens when a user adds a schedule (AddScheduleCommand):

image::ScheduleCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Basically, after the `setCalendarDate()` method in `Model` is executed, `CalendarPanel` listens to it and make the necessary changes to the agenda view by calling its `setAgendaView()` method.

==== Design Considerations / Alternative designs considered

* Whether schedules should be kept as `Appointment` objects instead of `Schedule` objects.
** We felt that the existence of our own `Schedule` object ensures that we can design it the way we want.
** We decided to not keep a list of `Appointment` in `CalendarPanel` as `Appointment` is only used for `Agenda` while the rest of our code uses `Schedule`.
** Instead, we have decided to only convert `Schedule` into `Appointment` when needed - during the creation of `CalendarPanel` or when there are changes made to the `UniqueList<Schedule>` variable.
Not keeping a list of `Appointment` ensures that we do not keep duplicate information.

* Where to store and change the date shown on Calendar Panel.
** The changes to `CalendarDate` was initially done in the `CalendarPanel` itself.
So, `CommandResult` was made to have one more variable `Optional<Calendar>`.
In that case, every time a schedule command was executed, a specific `Calendar` (if any) will be placed inside the constructor while creating the `CommandResult` object.
Else, Optional.Empty() will be placed inside.
** When the `MainWindow` executes the method performUiChanges(CommandResult), it will call the handleSchedule method with `Calendar` (from CommandResult) as an argument.
If `Optional<Calendar>` in `CommandResult` is empty, today's date and time will be used instead.
Then, `CalendarPanel` will be called in handleSchedule() to set the agenda view.
** This implementation was however changed because we thought that the date shown on the panel should be updated automatically.
Hence, we decided to use a listener instead.
`CalendarDate` is then placed in `Model` so that it can be edited immediately when `Model` executes any schedule related commands.
Also, this ensures that `CommandResult` remains unchanged and kept as simple as possible.

// end::schedule[]

// tag::find[]

=== Find Customer/Phone/Order feature
The find feature allows the user to find the customer/phone/order with matching keywords.
We wanted to implement an AND search and so long as the customer/phone/order contained the keyword
in its data, it would be shown to the user.
For simplicity's sake, we will only focus on Customer in this section.


The command that we wanted to implement is:

* e.g. `find-c Alice` -- would allow the user to find the customer with any data field that matches "Alice".

==== Current Implementation
In order to implement this feature, we decided to introduce a new predicate, `CustomerContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
Similar to AddressBook3's `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, the customer predicate tests that all keyword matches at least 1 data field of Customer.


image::dg-diagram/CustomerPredicateClassDiagram.png[]

Below is a diagram to show you how `find-c Alice` runs in the program.

image::dg-diagram/FindCustomerCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[]



==== Design Considerations / Alternative designs considered

Alternative 2: The other alternative that we considered in implementing the find feature was allowing the user to specify which field to check for.
First, we create a `FindCustomerDescriptor` that would store all the strings that were to be searched under the various data fields.
e.g. The `a/` prefix would mean to search for all the data fields of Customer. The `n/` prefix would mean to search for the name of Customers only.
The `FindCustomerCommandParser` would store the relevant key-phrases in the FindCustomerDescriptor and generate a different predicate,
`CustomerContainsKeyPhrasesPredicate`, using the FindCustomerDescriptor and pass it to `FindCustomerCommand`. `FindCustomerCommand` would then be executed.

However, the predicate `CustomerContainsKeyPhrasesPredicate` would do the heavy lifting by doing further parsing of the keywords
and test whether Customer contains the relevant keywords.

We did not implement this as `CustomerContainsKeyPhrasesPredicate` violated the Single-Responsibility Principle.
It had to do further parsing of the keywords instead of simply testing whether the Customer contains the keywords.
Also, if there was a change to the `Customer` class, it would be less intuitive to modify `CustomerContainsKeywordsPredicate`
as one would need to understand the parsing.



* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `CustomerContainsKeywordsPredicate`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Cannot search based on the exact data field.
* **Alternative 2:** `CustomerContainsKeyPhrasesPredicate`
** Pros: Less code written in total.
** Cons: Harder to maintain.

// end::find[]

=== Export feature
==== Implementation

The export mechanism is allows user to export current saved Json files into csv files available for import into MSExcel.
We made use of `FileReader` to read the Json saved data files. The data is used to create `JsonObjects` and stored into `JsonArray` and then CSV formatted string using comma delimiters.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ExportCommand#getCSVString()` -- Returns CSV formatted string containing the customer data, phone data, order data and schedule data.

===== How it works.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

The user executes `export filename` command to export current data into a CSV file.
`UserPrefs` is created and used to get the file path of the data files (i.e. customerbook.json).
The method getCSVString is executed to create `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` to read the data files from each of the path.
The string is then used to create `JsonObject` and then converted to CSV formatted string data representation.
At the end, the strings are appended to get the full CSV file containing the various data.


==== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Converting Json formatted string into CSV formatted string.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Customisation to design CSV layout requires re-formatting of the string.
* **Alternative 2:** Creating CSV formatted string straight from the Model.
** Pros: Easier to implement on the fly the decided layout of created CSV file.
** Cons: Harder to maintain. Had to code for the various cases in different data.

// end::export[]


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `UndoRedoStack`.

`UndoRedoStack` contains 2 stacks, `undoStack` and `redoStack`.
`undoStack` and `redoStack` contains commands that are of type `UndoableCommand`.
`UndoableCommand` extends Command and has the following attributes and methods.


image::dg-diagram/UndoableCommandClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

When an UndoableCommand is being executed, the methods `saveCustomerBookSnapshot(Model model)`, `savePhoneBookSnapshot(Model model)`, `saveOrderBookSnapshot(Model model)`, `saveScheduleBookSnapshot(Model model)`
and `saveArchivedOrderBookSnapshot(Model model)` will be called. This ensures that the states of all 5 books are being stored.

After a command is executed, `LogicManager` will add it into the `UndoRedoStack`.
This will be explained in the activity diagram below.

image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackPushActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

Next, when `UndoCommand` is being performed, `UndoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `RedoStack`.
It will then call `UndoableCommand#undo()` of the command that is removed.
The `undo()` method will then set the model to the previous snapshots of CustomerBook, PhoneBook, OrderBook, ScheduleBook and ArchivedOrderBook.
Afterwhich, it will save the original state of the model (e.g. before Undo took place) by calling `UndoableCommand#save(Model model)`.

Likewise, when `RedoCommand` is being performed, `RedoStack` will remove the first command in its stack and add it to `UndoStack`.
It will then call `UndoableCommand#redo()` of the command that is removed.
The `redo()` method will then set the model to the previous snapshots of CustomerBook, PhoneBook, OrderBook, ScheduleBook and ArchivedOrderBook.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.



Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UndoRedoStack` will be initialized.

image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackObjectDiagram0.png[[width="450"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete-c 5` command to delete the 5th customer. The `delete-c 5` command will be pushed into the `UndoRedoStack`.

image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackObjectDiagram1.png[[width="450"]

Step 3. The user executes `add-c n/David ...` to add a new customer. The `add-c` command will save all states of CustomerBook, PhoneBook, OrderBook, ScheduleBook and ArchivedOrderBook.

image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackObjectDiagram2.png[[width="450"]

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.


image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackObjectDiagram3.png[[width="450"]

[NOTE]
UndoCommand will check whether if there is any command to be undone by calling the `UndoRedoStack#canUndo()` method.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::dg-diagram/UndoSequenceDiagram.png[[width="450"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

NOTE: XYZ here refers to Customer, Phone, Order, Schedule and ArchivedOrder.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `UndoableCommand#redo()`.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list-c`. Commands that do not modify the 5 books (Customer, Phone, Order, Schedule and Archived Order), such as `list-c`, do not extend UndoableCommand.

image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackObjectDiagram4.png[[width="450"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear-c`.

image::dg-diagram/UndoRedoStackObjectDiagram5.png[[width="450"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire mdodel.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-c`, just save the customer being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
// end::undoredo[]

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use 2 stacks to store the history of the Models.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a command is undone, we must remember to save the previous model state to the command.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Open your command line prompt / terminal, navigate and input `java -jar [filename]` to run the file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample data. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app the same way you launched the application previously. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Adding a phone

. Adding a phone while all phones are listed

.. Test case: `add-p i/543407158585522 s/A123bcfe29 n/iPhone 11 b/Apple cp/128 cl/Purple $/$900 t/NEW t/Cool` +
   Expected: Phone with the above details is added the list. Details of the phone shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `add-p i/543407158585522 s/A123bcfe29 n/iPhone 11 b/Apple cp/128 cl/Purple t/NEW t/Cool` +
   Expected: No phone is added. Error details shown in the status message. Missing fields.
.. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add-c n/Steve Jobs c/12345678`, where the email field is missing. +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Deleting a customer

. Deleting a customer while all customers are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all customers using the `list-c` command. Multiple customers in the list.
.. Test case: `delete-c 1` +
   Expected: First customer is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted customer shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `delete-c 0` +
   Expected: No customer is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete-p`, `delete-p x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Editing an order

. Edit an order while all orders are listed.

.. Prerequisites: List all customers using the `list-o` command. There must be at least 1 order in the list.
.. Test case: `edit-o 1 $/$1000` +
   Expected: Price of the first order is edited. Details of the edited order is shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `edit-o 1` +
   Expected: Nothing is edited. Error details shown in the status message. No fields to be edited.
.. Other incorrect edit commands to try: `edit-c 1 c/abc`, c/ is the prefix for contact number but alphabets are entered instead +
   Expected: Error message shown due to erroneous input.

=== Saving data

. Data is automatically saved after every command.

.. When the application is relaunched, it will check for the validity of the data.
Any corrupted data in any of the data files (customer, phone, order, schedule, archived order) will cause SML to start with an empty data book for that particular corrupted type of data.



=== Testing Statistics

. Display statistics between 2 dates

.. Prerequisites: Ensure that archive order panel has suitable `Completed` and `scheduled` orders. Only these orders
will show up in the calculation
.. Test case: `generate-s s/revenue d1/2018.12.13 d2/2019.11.13`
    Expeected: Chart is displayed in popup window
