== Introduction

DukeCooks is a revolutionary lifestyle application, specially designed for health-conscious students. Targeting busy
students that are long-time users of the Command-Line Interface (CLI), DukeCooks offers such users a CLI healthy
lifestyle application. This means, expert-CLI student users will be able to execute different commands, all within a single line.
They will be able to manage various aspects of their lifestyle, from their diet, to exercises and health records.

They can use DukeCooks to manage all their lifestyle needs, all within one single app.

With DukeCooks, being healthy has never been easier!

=== Purpose

This developer guide aims to provide you with both the technical and non-technical aspects of DukeCooks. It also provides
insight into the future direction of DukeCooks. After reading this document, you should be able to understand the design,
architecture and goals of DukeCooks.

=== Understanding the document

TIP: Pro tips which you may find useful.

NOTE: Information that you should take note of.

WARNING: Information that you should be careful with.

[horizontal]

`Model`:: Text with orange highlight (also known as mark-up) indicates a class / package name.

`__Model.java__`:: Italic text with mark-up indicates a file name / github link.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `dukecooks.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the DukeCooks branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-2/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based while AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, DukeCooks's architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/Main.java[`_Main_`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/MainApp.java[`_MainApp_`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.


.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Interaction of architecture components

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete recipe 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/ui/Ui.java[`_Ui.java_`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

[NOTE]
====
XYZListPanel refers to the 6 different individual components in our application.
The 6 different components are:

* Dashboard
* Recipe Book
* Meal Plan
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/ui/MainWindow.java[`_MainWindow_`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`_MainWindow.fxml_`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/logic/Logic.java[`_Logic.java_`]

.  `Logic` uses the `DukeCooksParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for simplified interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete recipe 1")` API call.

.Simplified Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete recipe 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/model/Model.java[`_Model.java_`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Duke Cooks data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* BlackBox refers to the model diagram of the individual components of DukeCooks.

[NOTE]
====
XYZ refers to the 5 different individual components in our application.
The 5 different components are:

* Dashboard
* Recipe Book
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/storage/Storage.java[`_Storage.java_`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the DukeCooks data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `dukecooks.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Commands and Parser
All command variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`, `AddExerciseCommand`) extends from `AddCommand`,
instead of the abstract `Command` class.
This applies to other type of commands as well, such as `DeleteCommand` and `EditCommand`.

The diagram below shows a simplified class diagram for Commands and Parser.

.Structure of Commands and Parser
image::CommandImplementation.png[]

==== Design Considerations
[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Implementing commands and parser
|Command variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`, `AddExerciseCommand`) extend from `AddCommand`.

*Pros* +
Easier scalability as subsequent variants of `AddCommand` can simply extend from it.

*Cons* +
Complex implementation and increases the amount of code within repository as for each command variant added, a
corresponding variant parser needs to be added.

*Our Choice* +
This choice was chosen for DukeCooks which comprises of different components with the same variants of commands (i.e Add, Edit, Delete etc.)
This reduces the amount of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser` and makes testing more manageable.

|Command variants extend from `Command` class

*Pros* +
Relatively easier to implement.

*Cons* +
Greatly increase number of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser` and this could increase the difficulty of debugging as it becomes
harder to locate bugs. Furthermore, this implementation exposes all underlying command variants to `DukeCooksParser`.
|===

// tag::dashboard[]
=== Dashboard feature

In DukeCooks, a `Dashboard` object represents an event a user needs to attend to, a task. A `Dashboard` is made up of
a `DashboardName`, `TaskDate` and `TaskStatus`. Below is a class diagram (Figure 10) that illustrates how `Dashboard` interacts with other classes.

.Dashboard Class Diagram
image::DashboardClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Implementation
The functions add/delete/edit/find/list/done task, are found under the Dashboard. +
The Dashboard in `DukeCooks` serves as a homepage which displays a list of tasks set out
by the user. The tasks are sorted accordingly by earliest date; using a custom sorting algorithm.
Here, a task is represented by a Dashboard object.

The operations are as followed:

* `add task` -- Adds and saves the task into `DukeCooks`.
* `delete task` -- Removes the specified task from `DukeCooks`.
* `edit task` -- Edits the specified with a new task name and/or date.
* `done task` -- Marks a task as complete.
* `find task` -- Finds a list of task with a given keyword.
* `list taskincomlete` -- Lists all the incomplete tasks.
* `list taskcomlete` -- Lists all the completed tasks.
* `goto dashboard` -- Directs user to the dashboard window.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `addDashboard()`,
`deleteDashboard()`, `setDashboard()`, `Model#hasDashboard()` , `doneDashboard` and
`getDashboardRecords()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete/edit/find/done/dashboard
mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user is currently at a another part of DukeCooks and wants to go to the Dashboard. The
user executes the `goto dashboard` command. The `goto dashboard` command calls `getDashboardRecords()`,
which returns the `ReadOnlyDashboard` that returns the `UniqueDashboardList`, iterating over all the task and displaying it on the
homepage.

Step 2. The user executes `add task tn/bake a cake td/12/12/2019` command to add a new
task into DukeCooks. The `add` command calls `addDashboard()`, causing the task to
be added into `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls`add()` which will call `sortDashboard()`.
At this stage, the list of task is sorted by date. After which, the `add` command also calls `saveDashboard()` to be
saved the `goto dashboard` into the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 3. The user executes `delete task 3` command to delete the 3rd task in the
dashboard. The `delete` command calls `deleteDashboard()` causing the specified task
to be removed from `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`remove()` which will call `sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. Also, it calls `saveDashboard()`,
after the `delete task 3` command executes
to be saved in the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 4. The user executes `edit task...` command to edit a field in a task. The `edit`
command calls `setDashboard()` causing the edited task to be updated in
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `setDashboard()`
which will call `sortDashboard()`. At this stage, the list of task is
sorted by date. Also, it calls `saveDashboard()`, after the `edit task...` command executes to be saved into the `UniqueDashboardList`

Step 5. The user executes `find task...` command to find a list of task given a keyword.
The `find` command calls `hasDashboard()`, which searches through the
`UniqueDashboardList` for tasks containing the particular keyword.

Step 6. The user executes `done task 1` command to mark the first task in the list as complete. The `done task`
command calls `doneDashboard()`, which will cause the task to be marked as complete in the
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `done()`, which adds
the newly created `Dashboard` object and adds it into the list. After which, `sortDashboard()`
is called to sort the list by date and reflect the newly made changes.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 11) shows how the done operation works:

==== Making Decisions

[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|*Aspect* |*Option 1 (Chosen)*|*Option 2*

|Storing a task's status
|A custom class, `TaskStatus`, is created to keep track of the task's status.

*Pros* +
Additional statuses can be introduced in easily in the future. +

*Cons* +
Because a `String` is used to create a `TaskStatus`, typos could be made when adding test cases. +

*Our Choice* +
This choice was chosen as it does not limit us to only having tasks marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".
Since choice 1 was used, additional status, "RECENTLY COMPLETED" could be added with ease.

|Use a boolean to check if a task is complete.

*Pros* +
Easy to implement.

*Cons* +
 Limits expansion since a task can only be marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".

|Sorting tasks by date

|Every time the `add`, `delete`, `edit` task command is called, a `sort` is executed.

*Pros* +
 Easy to implement. Because `sort` is implemented regardless if the list is in-order or not,
there is lesser chance for errors.

*Cons* +
 Because `sort` is executed every time, this might slow down the performance.

*Our Choice* +
This choice was chosen as it reduces the chance of errors making it a safer option.

|Keep an instance of the earliest and latest date. If dates fall out of range from the two dates, sorting does not happen.

*Pros* +
Faster runtime.

*Cons* +
Additional lines of code needed to check if the date falls out of range. Higher chance of making mistakes during implementation.
|===
// end::dashboard[]

=== Recipe Book feature
The current implementation of Recipe Book consists of the following:

* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `RecipeName`
* Each `Recipe` contains an Set of `Ingredient`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Calories`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Carbohydrates`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Fats`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Protein`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Recipe` class.

.Recipe Class Diagram
image::RecipeClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of recipe book commands

`Recipe` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddRecipeCommand` - Adds a `Recipe` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteRecipeCommand` - Deletes a `Recipe` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditRecipeCommand` - Edits the specified `Recipe`
* `FindRecipeCommand` - Finds all `Recipe` whose `RecipeName` contains user-specified keywords

All the above recipe commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddRecipeCommandParser`,
`DeleteRecipeCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteRecipeCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteRecipeCommand`.
The input provided is `delete recipe 1`.

.DeleteRecipeCommand Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

After a successful execution, the recipe with the specified index will be deleted from the recipe book.

The DeleteRecipeCommand will also delete the recipe from all meal plans that by filtering through all saved meal plans,
checking for the existence of the recipe it is about to delete, and replace that meal plan with a new one. This is done
using MealPlan#removeRecipe.

==== Design Considerations
[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Updating of recipe components in meal plans upon recipe modifications
| Dynamic updates upon recipe modification

*Pros* +
Allows for a better user experience, less reliance on the user to ensure that all displayed information is updated.

*Cons* +
Harder to implement, requires for checks on meal plans upon every recipe modification, reducing performance of modification operations.

*Our Choice* +
We chose to have the updating of the recipes within meal plans to be done whenever a relevant recipe operation occurs,
namely recipe deletion and edition. This provides a better user experience as the user will never need to remember that
they have to run an update every single time they modify their recipes. This is favourable as we wish for DukeCooks to
be as easy to use as possible.


| Manual updates at any point in time

*Pros* +
Simplest implementation and most novice programmers are familiar with it.

*Cons* +
Relies on user to remember they need to update the meal plans upon recipe modification. Could result in confusion on the
user's end. Also unintuitive from the user's standpoint, and makes recipe modification a hassle.
|===

=== Meal Plan feature
The current implementation of Meal Plan consists of the following:

* Each `Meal Plan` consists of a unique `MealPlanName`
* Each `Meal Plan` contains 7 Lists of `RecipeName`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Meal Plan` class.

.Meal Plan Class Diagram
image::MealPlanClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of meal plan commands

`MealPlan` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddMealPlanCommand` - Adds a `MealPlan` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteMealPlanCommand` - Deletes a `MealPlan` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditMealPlanCommand` - Edits the specified `MealPlan`
* `FindMealPlanCommand` - Finds all `MealPlan` whose `MealPlanName` contains user-specified keywords
* `FindMealPlanWithCommand` Finds all `MealPlan` whose days contain user-specified `RecipeName`.

All the above meal plan commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddMealPlanCommandParser`,
`DeleteMealPlanCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddMealPlanCommand`,
`DeleteMealPlanCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteMealPlanCommand`.
The input provided is `delete mealplan 1`.

.DeleteRecipeCommand Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteMealPlanSequenceDiagram.png[]

After a successful execution, the meal plan with the specified index will be deleted from the meal plan book.

==== Design Considerations
[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Amount of recipe information to be saved in a meal plan
| Saving only the recipe name

*Pros* +
Less memory required to save meal plan as it only keeps track of recipe names. Easier to maintain dynamic updates upon recipe
modification.

*Cons* +
Requires that meal plans make a query to obtain the rest of a recipe's information using that recipe's name whenever the user
views that meal plan.

*Our Choice* +
We decided to only capture recipe name information within the meal plan, as we concluded that the meal plan need not know
of a recipe's nutritional value, difficulty, preparation time, or image location until the meal plan is viewed by the user.
This allows for smaller storage of meal plans as each meal plan does not need to hold that much information about the recipes
that it contains. Only when the meal plan is viewed will it use the recipe name data it has to query for the rest of that
recipe's information. Additionally, only storing the recipe name makes the implementation of dynamic updating between meal
plans and recipes much easier.


| Saving the entire recipe

*Pros* +
Easier to implement view command as the meal plan does not need to query for the recipe's other information whenever it needs to.

*Cons* +
Requires more memory to save each meal plan as recipe ingredients can be very extensive. Also requires more checks to be done
upon recipe modification to allow for dynamic updates, which is harder to implement.
|===

=== Workout Planner feature

The workout feature allows users to create their own custom workouts with `add Workout` command and adding their own
custom exercises to it with `push exercise`. With these custom workouts, they can then choose to run them through
`run workout` and monitor their progress and workout history with `view workout`.

==== Implementation

{nbsp} +
*Workout Management*

Every workout comprises of the following information:

* `WorkoutName` representing the name of the workout
* `Average Intensity` representing the average demands of the exercises in the workout
* A set of `MuscleType` which represents all the muscles trained by the workout
* An ArrayList of `ExerciseName` of exercises that would be carried out in the workout
* `WorkoutHistory` containing information on all the previous runs of the workout as well as some statistics

The Workout Class also contains the function `updateHistory(WorkoutRun run)` which adds the `WorkoutRun` into the
WorkoutHistory and updates all the relevant fields accordingly, returning a new Workout instance with updated `WorkoutHistory`.
The class also utilises `pushExercise(Exercise exercise, Set<ExerciseDetail> details)` function to add new `Exercise` and
return a new Workout with update fields. There is also an option to push an exercise without the details with the overloaded
method which instead opts to use the pre-built Set of `ExerciseDetails` in the `Exercise` itself.

The Workout Class is represented by the class diagram below.

.Workout Class Diagram
image::WorkoutClassDiagram.png[]

The Workout Class is managed by the following commands:

* `AddWorkoutCommand` - Adds a new empty `Workout` into `WorkoutPlanner`
* `DeleteWorkoutCommand` - Deletes a `Workout` specified by an `Index` from `WorkoutPlanner`
* `PushExerciseCommand` - Pushes an `Exercise` specified by an `Index` into an existing `Workout`


{nbsp} +
*Exercise Management*

In order to run a `Workout`, users will have to add `Exercises` into the `Workout` as an empty workout cannot be ran.
Users can use existing exercises or create their own custom exercises. Every exercise contains the following information:

* `ExerciseName` representing the name of the exercise
* `MusclesTrained` comprising of the primary `MuscleType` as well as an ArrayList of secondary `MuscleType` trained
* `Intensity` or how demanding the exercise is
* A set of `ExerciseDetails` which are optional additional information of the exercise such as `ExerciseWeight`,
`Distance`, `Sets` and `Repetitions`
* `ExerciseHistory` containing information on all the previous `ExerciseRun` of the exercise

Like `Workout`, `Exercise` also has the method `updateHistory` which returns an updated Exercise with a new
`ExerciseRun` accounted for.

The Exercise class is represented by the following class diagram below.

.Exercise Class Diagram
image::ExerciseClassDiagram.png[]

The `Exercise` class is managed by the following commands :

* `AddExerciseCommand` - Adds a new `Exercise` into `WorkoutPlanner`
* `ClearExerciseCommand` - Clears all the `Exercise` objects in `WorkoutPlanner`
* `DeleteExerciseCommand` - Deletes an `Exercise` specified by an `Index` from `WorkoutPlanner`
* `EditExerciseCommand` - Edits the specified `Exercise` with newly specified information
* `FindExerciseByIntensityCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects with the `Intensity` specified
* `FindExerciseByMuscleCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects which trains the `MuscleType` specified
* 'FindExerciseCommand' - Lists all `Exercise` objects with `ExerciseName` that contains the string specified
* 'ListExercise' - Lists all 'Exercise' objects in `WorkoutPlanner`

All the exercise and workout commands above are parsed in `DukeCooksParser`, invoking the respective Command Parsers
(Add, Delete, Edit etc.). The `Exercise`/`Workout` variant of the parser will then be instantiated
(i.e `AddExerciseCommandParser`,`DeleteWorkoutCommandParser` etc) to create the actual command objects
(i.e AddExerciseCommand, DeleteWorkoutCommand etc). These Command Objects will then execute the necessary steps
to fulfill their functionality.

{nbsp} +
*Running of Workouts*

The core functionality of the WorkoutPlanner is to run a `Workout` and have it automatically tracking your progress
by making records in its history. This is done through the `Run Workout Command`. The following sequence diagrams show
what happens when the command is invoked.

.Sequence Diagram of RunWorkoutCommand
image::RunWorkoutSequenceDiagram.png[]

As seen in the diagram above, when the command is invoked, the `RunWorkoutParser` is initialised to parse the argument String
to initialise `RunWorkoutCommand`. The Command object will then run its execute method, which calls upon get method of
UniqueWorkoutList to obtain the target `Workout`. The target workout and message will then be passed back to the Ui through
the CommandResult object. The Ui will then boot a new `RunWorkoutWindow` with the targeted workout.

.Activity Diagram of RunWorkoutWindow
image::RunWorkoutActivityDiagram.png[]

The user will then run each set of each exercise until the workout is complete. The full loop is demonstrated in the
activity diagram in Figure 17.

.Sequence Diagram of UpdateWorkoutCommand
image::RunWorkoutSequenceDiagram1.png[]

Upon completion of the workout, the Ui will immediately generate a new `UpdateWorkoutCommand` containing the `Workout`
that has been ran and a newly instantiated `WorkoutRun` with the details of the run. `UpdateWorkoutCommand` will then
be executed and the following will occur:

. New Workout will be generated. +
Using Workout's `updateHistory` method, a new updated `Workout` will be created.
. The outdated Workout will be replaced by the new Workout. +
Using `UniqueWorkoutList` 's `setWorkout` method, the old workout will be removed and the updated one will be placed in
its stead
. CommandResult is generated and passed back to Ui. +
A new CommandResult will be returned containing a congratulatory message to the Ui signalling the successful completion
of the workout.

*Design Considerations*

[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Storing an Exercise/Workout's intensity
|Intensity was stored as an Enumeration instead of a class

*Pros* +
Intensity can be limited only a specific amount of values

*Cons* +
Intensity will only be an estimate instead of a specific value given the value limits +

*Our Choice* +
This option was chosen in the end to simplify the classification of exercise so that users can more easily filter by
intensity. Furthermore, this allows for more Ui diversification by having different images for each intensity.

|Setting Intensity as a Class

*Pros* +
Easy to implement.

*Cons* +
Makes filtering by intensity a more tedious affair for both developers and users.

|Storing MuscleTypes

|Have MuscleType be a class on its own

*Pros* +
Muscles are referred to by various names and allowing the user to set their own muscle names allow for more
familiarity

*Cons* +
MuscleType class will require stricter validation to ensure that users do not mess up the programme with unintended
inputs.

*Our Choice* +
This option was chosen to allow for greater flexibility of naming for the muscle types but at the same time still limited
to prevent the users from going wild.

|Store MuscleType as an enumeration

*Pros* +
There are limited muscles in the body, allowing for a proper limit +

*Cons* +
Muscles may have multiple names that are not accounted for by the enum.

|Storage of Exercises in Workout
|Workouts only store a list of ExerciseName and not the full exercise

*Pros* +
Exercises only have to be edited once upon execution of edit command - more cost effective. It also avoids
unnecessarily large storage files.

*Cons* +
Each time an exercise of workout has to be referenced, the entire storage of exercise has to be scoured

*Our Choice*
In the end we decided to choose this option as we foresee that the edit command will be utilised more often than calling
an exercise from a workout. Furthermore, to improve timing, we kept a sorted storage for exercise to allow for the quicker
binary search.

| Workouts store whole Exercises

*Pros* +
Exercises can be extracted quickly

*Cons* +
Huge storage space is required. Also complicates editing of exercises.

// tag::healthRecords[]
[[HealthRecordsTag]]
=== Health Records feature
The Health Records feature allows user to track their health progress using the commands
`add health`, as well as making changes to their records with `edit health`, `delete health` and `clear health`.

Additionally, users can create and personalize their own profile with the commands `add profile`,
`edit profile` and `delete profile`.

In a nut shell, the Health Records feature supports the following operations:

* Storing of the health data recorded by the user
* Present the data with graph representation that shows the health progress of the user
* Personalizing user profile

==== Implementation

A `Record` consist of four key components: `Type`, `Timestamp`, `Value`, `Remark`.
Refer to the diagram below to understand the structure of `Record`.

.Structure of the Record Component
image::HealthRecordsClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of Health Records commands

`Record` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddRecordCommand` - Adds a `Record` into DukeCooks
* `DeleteRecordCommand` - Deletes a `Record` from DukeCooks
* `EditRecordCommand` - Edits the specified `Record` with a new changes made
* `ListHealthCommand` - Lists all available records to user
* `ListHealthByTypeCommand` - Lists all available records of the corresponding record type to user
* `ClearHealthCommand` - Clears all available records

`Person` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddProfileCommand` - Adds a new `Person` into DukeCooks
* `DeleteProfileCommand` - Deletes the `Person` into DukeCooks
* `EditProfileCommand` - Edits various fields of the specified `Person`

[IMPORTANT]
====
User Profile consist of one `person` object.
Dukecooks will only allow one user profile to exist.
====

==== Execution of AddRecordCommand

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of an `AddRecordCommand`.

.AddHealthCommand Sequence Diagram
image::AddHealthSequenceDiagram.png[]

The command will first be parsed in 'DukeCooksParser' and be handled to its corresponding parsers (i.e. `AddRecordCommandParser`) based on its variant word
(i.e. `Add`).

After the parsing has been executed successfully, the string argument will be converted to `Type`, `Value`, `Timestamp`,
`Remark` attributes. These attributes will then be passed into the `Model` component for its underlying validity checks.

Once all checks have passed successfully, a new `Record` will be created according to those attributes
and added to health records with the command `Model#addRecord`.

[NOTE]
====
The illustration of the above execution only applies to all record types except for **Weight** and **Height**.
Refer to the next section for more details.
====

==== Syncing record data with profile

To illustrate why the simple model of `AddRecordCommand` will not suffice for *Weight* and *Height* record types,
below depicts the class diagram of the `Person` class

.Structure of the Person Component
image::PersonClassDiagram.png[]

It can be observed that `Person` share similar attributes to `Record`, both *Weight* and *Height*.
However, the implementation of the two types are distinctly different among `Record` and `Person`. `Record` have
structured *Weight* and *Height* to be attributes of its `Type` enum class while `Person` has defined
them separately to be classes of their own.

The Sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of `AddRecordCommand` with additional component introduced to
help sync data between the `Record` and `Person`.

.Reconstructed AddRecordCommand
image::LinkHealthToProfileSequenceDiagram.png[]

Once `Model#addRecord` has been executed, `AddRecordCommand` will check the type of
the newly added record. If it is a *Weight* or *Height* record, `LinkProfile#updateProfile`
will be called. The `LinkProfile` helps `AddRecordCommand` to invoke `EditProfileCommand` by
calling for changes to be made for profile.

A simplified activity diagram of the problem can be shown below.

.Activity Diagram of adding a new Weight record
image::LinkProfileActivityDiagram.png[]

Once profile have been successfully updated, person's weight/ height is expected to be
in sync with health records.

// end::healthRecords[]

==== Design Considerations

[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Data Structure used to store Record Type
|`Enum` class is used to store record types.

*Pros* +
Type safe and more static control over the record types.

*Cons* +
Limiting health record types as no dynamic additions can be made.

This choice was chosen as it is easier to maintain for our model. Additionally, the extension of having user defined health
types would mean more validity checks and maintenance needed.

|A `HashMap` is used to store record types.

*Pros* +
Increase flexibility and have the possible extension of allowing user defined health types.

*Cons* +
More error prone compared to enums.

|===

// tag::diary[]
[[DiaryTag]]
=== Diary feature
==== Implementation
The current implementation of Diary consists of the following:

* Each `Diary` consists of a unique `DiaryName`
* Each `Diary` contains an array list of `Page`
* Each `Page` is identified by a unique `Title`, `PageType`, `Page Description` and `Page Image`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Diary` class.

.Diary Class Diagram
image::DiaryClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of diary commands

`Diary` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddDiaryCommand` - Adds a `Diary` into DukeCooks
* `DeleteDiaryCommand` - Deletes a `Diary` from DukeCooks
* `EditDiaryCommand` - Edits the specified `Diary` with a new `DiaryName`
* `ViewDiaryCommand` - Views the specified `Diary` using the provided index
* `FindDiaryCommand` - Finds the specified `Diary` using the provided keyword
* `ListDiaryCommand` - Lists all available diaries to user
* `AddPageCommand` - Adds a new `Page` to the specified `Diary`
* `DeletePageCommand` - Deletes the `Page` in the specified `Diary`
* `EditPageCommand` - Edits various fields of the specified `Page`

All the above commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` first and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddDiaryCommandParser`,
`DeleteDiaryCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddDiaryCommand`,
`DeleteDiaryCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteDiaryCommand`.

.Sequence Diagram of DeleteDiaryCommand
image::DeleteDiarySequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +
After a successful execution, the specified diary will be removed.

==== Implementation of Images

All images used in DukeCooks are copied into an internal data folder and all subsequent loading of images is done from
within this internal folder. The following activity diagram explains how an image is created in DukeCooks:

.Activity diagram of adding images
image::ImageActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
[cols="20%,40%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Data structures used to store `Page`
| `Page` objects are stored using an ArrayList

*Pros* +
Simplest implementation and most novice programmers are familiar with it.

*Cons* +
List operations tend to run slower as compared to other data structures such as sets.

*Our Choice* +
This choice was chosen as we require the `Page` objects to be ordered, which is a functionality only provided in lists.
In addition, the ordered `Page` objects greatly simplify the implementation of other commands such as `DeletePageCommand`
as an page index can simply be provided to execute the command.


| `Page` objects are stored using Sets

*Pros* +
Faster runtime.

*Cons* +
Sets do not provide an order to the `Page` objects.

| Loading of images

| Defensively copies images into our internal data folder and all subsequent loading of images is done from this folder.

*Pros* +
Less prone to user errors when loading images. (i.e when user deletes image from their local directory)

*Cons* +
 Increased memory usage as each image needs to be saved internally.

*Our Choice* +
This choice was chosen as it is less-prone to user errors and is safer.

| Load images directly from user's directory

*Pros* +
Easy to implement.

*Cons* +
 May lead to unexpected errors when loading images. (i.e when user deletes image from their local directory)

// end::diary[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc provides greater flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

You may refer to <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> and learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Editing Diagrams

You may refer to <<UsingPlantUml#, UsingPlantUml.adoc>> and learn how to create and update UML diagrams in the Developer Guide.

=== Publishing Documentation

You may refer to <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> and learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`_build.gradle_`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
====

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

[NOTE]
You may refer to <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more information on how to run tests using Gradle.

=== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `dukecooks.StringUtilTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `dukecooks.storage.StorageManagerTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `dukecooks.LogicManagerTest`

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

You may refer to <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> and learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. Refer to <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. Refer to <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews

When a pull request make changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. Refer to <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`_MainApp.java_`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, DukeCooks depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

. Include third-party libraries in the repository (This bloats the repository size)
. Require developers to download third-party libraries manually (Requires extra work from developers)


[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* health conscious individuals
* prefers to have a complete health monitoring all in one app
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: +
DukeCooks monitors all aspects of the user's lifestyle in one single application. This provides the user with the added
benefit of having to only manage a single application, instead of managing different applications. This is particularly
useful for busy individuals who do not have time to manage different applications.
