Marketing effort, far from being a homogeneous input, is a combination of the 4ps, namely 1) pricing and price promotion, 2) promotional activities such as advertising, personal selling and public relation, 3) distribution and channel activities related to the availability of goods and servicing of orders, and 4) product- development and product-improvement activities. In this course, we will study the strategic interactions within the 4Ps and discuss the latest issues.",
