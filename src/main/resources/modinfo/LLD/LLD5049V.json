    "description": "The subject of conflict of laws addresses three questions: Which country should hear the case? What law should be applied? What is the effect of its adjudication in another country? This course includes an outline of jurisdiction and judgments techniques, but will focus on problems in choice of law, and issues in the exclusion of foreign law. Coverage includes problems in contract and torts, and other areas may be selected from time to time. This course is complementary to International Commercial Litigation, but it stands on its own as an introduction to theories and methodologies in the conflict of laws.",
