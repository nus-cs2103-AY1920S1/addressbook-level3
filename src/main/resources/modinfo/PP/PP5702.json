    "description": "This module introduces the key concepts relating to the theory and practice of public administration. The module is organised around four themes: foundations (key concepts and contexts of public administration); core functions (different types of public organisation); key processes; values; and challenges. The module uses both a comparative approach and case studies from Asia to link theory to real-world practice of public administration. Upon completion of the module, students will be familiar with the key issues in public administration and will be able in better position to relate the various components of their degree programme.",
