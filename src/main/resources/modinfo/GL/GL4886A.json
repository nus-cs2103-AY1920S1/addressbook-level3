    "description": "This module critically examines the various contested definitions, practices, policies and laws of citizenship found around the world. It explores how historical legacies, levels of economic development, regime transformations, political geographies, technological changes, and social forces shape who belongs (and who does not) to a particular political community or nation\u2010state. The module systematically applies key concepts to case studies from around the world to highlight how and why actors bestow, deny, and contest citizenship as well as the policy and normative implications that flow from these processes.",
