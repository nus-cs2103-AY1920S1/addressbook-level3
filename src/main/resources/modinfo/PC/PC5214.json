    "description": "The ability to setup high-quality experiments and measurements is fundamental to innovation in many areas of sciences and engineering, including materials and devices. Therefore a good understanding of, and practical training, in experimental physics techniques is essential to a lot of research and development work in both academia and industry. This course equips students with the essential knowledge and practical skills in a broad range of modern experimental physics techniques, including: mechanical design and materials selection; vacuum technology, cyostats, and thin-film deposition techniques; Gaussian beam laser optics; photodetectors; stepper motors and piezoelectric actuators; feedback and control loops; techniques in analog, digital and pulse signal processing; weak-signal detection and lock-in amplifiers; fast-signal detection and transmission lines. The practical skills will be taught in laboratory classes, which are part of this course.",
