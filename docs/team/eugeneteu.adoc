== PROJECT: Seller Manager Lite Junior
== Overview

Seller Manager Lite is a desktop application used for managing a business operational and logistical needs.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has >10 kLoC.
It was written over the span of 2 months and morphed from the original Address-book 3 application

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *ability to generate statistics*
** What it does: allows the user to query total `Revenue`, `Cost` and `profit` on all past orders. Contains 2 types of input mode:
*** No date input: This mode is to give users a quick way of obtaining the numbers
*** Date input: This mode is to produce a monthly chart view of the statistics

** Justification: Being business owners, this feature should be very essential for the owners to be able to track their statistics and numbers while running their day to day operations. This allows them to more easily plan and monitor their business while using these numbers.
** Highlights: This feature cut across several layers in the entire project e.g logic, UI, model and hence designing it in such a way that it was able to work with the existing Model View Controller architecture was a very important albeit tedious step.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. This design choice is elaborated below in the developer guide writeup.
*** The implementation was also challenging as I made very sure no to violate any of the SOLID principles. At the same time, we were also still deciding how to implement the rest of the architecture for the other features.
*** A total of 4 attempts of refactoring was needed for me to reach the current version of the main feature.

** Credits: The https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/[apache commons math libraries] was used in the actual calculation. The main difficulty of this feature  come from extracting the correct and appropiate data needed and in the appropiate manner.

* *Other Major enhancement*:
** My other contributions to the codebase is as follows:
*** Complete overhaul of User Interface. This includes generating the FXML files, creating the controller files, importing and GUI tests.
*** UI commands. This includes the command that is directly related to switching of UI e.g `switch-o` which allows the user to switch their their focused tab panel with a command

* *Code contributed*:

* contributed total almost 7k LOC:
** 3k+ functional & 3k+ test code: https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=eugeneteu&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=false[code]
