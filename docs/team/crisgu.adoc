== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added and implemented the entire *Finance* section of the project which includes major GUI implementations
and 2 Finance related commands.
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.

** What does it do: The *Finance* section was implemented to allow users to get the detail of all employees in a easy manner.
The tab shows three finance related details which are 'Total Salary' 'Pending To Pay' 'Salary Paid'. Two commands were
implemented which are 'pay' and 'undo_pay', allow user to make the payment or undo the payment for the employee.

** Justification: In the HR department, *Finance* is a very big issue to handle because after every event there are
too many payslips. Having a dedicated *Finance* tab, along with the 'pay' and 'undo_pay' commands will increase the efficiency
of the HR staff greatly.

** Highlights: The Finance section required a deep understanding of the Employee class as several fields of an Employee object are modified upon the execution of Finance commands. Understanding of the relevant Parser classes were also essential as arithmetic calculations depended on static methods within those Parser classes.
* *Minor enhancement*: Implement Employee class, and all relevant new fields in the class that did not exist in AB3.
