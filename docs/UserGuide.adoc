Our team is still working on the User Guide. Keep a look out for more cool and exciting features coming soon!

== Introduction

Thank you for checking out TimeBook! TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3). TimeBook is a scheduler application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends. It also can find the common free time and venues among the user and his or her friends. TimeBook will have the following features:

.  A graphical user interface (GUI) but most of the interactions with the application would happen using command line interface (CLI).
.  Allows users to add the schedules of his or her friends and organise them into groups.
.  Deconflict different schedules of different people and different groups to find the common free time among them.
.  Integration with NUSmods API to allow users to enter their NUSmods timetable link to add it to their schedule.
.  Integration with Google Maps API to allow the application to evaluate the best venue for the group to meet up during the free time in their schedules.

== Understanding this guide
=== Basic Information
This guide is a explains how you can use *TimeBook* to the fullest extent to assist you to plan for your group's meeting.

You can find the steps needed to start scheduling group activities with your friends or loved ones in the quick start and general
*lifecycle* usage of our application. If you happen to stumble upon some difficulties, our *Frequently Asked Questions* (FAQ) is
here to address that. If you are an experienced *Command Line Interface (CLI)* user, you can hope right into using the application by
looking at our *Command Summary*. Otherwise, take a look at the *Unexperienced CLI user* section to obtain more information on how

== Unexperienced CLI user

Unlike most applications, where you use your mouse to interact with the application such as scrolling and clicking, our application
mostly use the *Command Line Interface*. Most of the time, you would be interacting with the application through typing commands in the
command box of the application.

You can play around with the commands in the *Command Summary* to get yourself warmed up.
