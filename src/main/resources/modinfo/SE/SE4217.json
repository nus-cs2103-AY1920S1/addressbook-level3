    "description": "Southeast Asia has been linked to the rest of the world through various channels: historically through colonisation, geographically by land, water and air, economically through trade, financial capital, technology and foreign aid, politically through regional and international organisations, and culturally through human mobility. This module examines these linkages and the various factors that have influenced them particularly in terms of the national, regional and international policies.",
