    "description": "Career Catalyst will establish an important first touch point as part of a three/four-year roadmap to engage and prepare students in creating multiple pathways for themselves. Students will be equipped with essential skills and knowledge to make informed decisions on specialisations, develop soft skills as well as gain overseas exposure and real-world industry experience. This module consists of four lectures and two e-seminars spread across the first six weeks of the freshmen academic year, aimed to provide an early introduction to the concepts of career planning, personal branding and industry awareness. Students will learn to develop a strategy to maximise their time and resources while in University, be confident in mapping out a career plan and work towards strengthening their fit to achieve their career aspirations.",
