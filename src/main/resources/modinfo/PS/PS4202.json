    "description": "This module covers political parties and electoral systems in both established and new democracies. In the West, political party systems reflect highly institutionalised electoral systems and are relatively stable. In much of the world, however, political parties are less institutionalized and more responsive to volatile electorates than those in the West, and many new democracies have failed to develop even minimally stable party systems. The aim of the module is to provide students with a good grasp of the issues and current research on political parties and elections in the West, in Asia, and around the world.",
