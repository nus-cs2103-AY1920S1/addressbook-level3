A powerlifting competition consists of 3 lifts, the Squat, Bench, and Deadlift.
With 3 attempts, athletes will try to outdo and challenge themselves and lift as heavy as they can. +

The *Powerlifting Competition Coordinator* (PCC) is for powerlifting competitions organisers.
The desktop application will help event organisers keep a record of past competitions and competitors.
It can also facilitate the competition during the actual session,
by continuously updating records of the athletes attempts on their lifts.
Finally, PCC will keep its leader board up to date,
to keep spectators and athletes hyped up and to find out who is the strongest lifter. +

To support the ease of data-entry, we have provided a Command Line Interface (CLI) that is augmented with a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help them better administer such powerlifting competitions. +
