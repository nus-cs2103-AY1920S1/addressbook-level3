    "description": "The field of emotion contributes too many subdisciplines within psychology including cognitive, social, clinical, and health psychology. This module aims to provide students with a solid foundation in emotion by introducing them to relevant research done internationally and within the Department of Psychology. Topics to be covered will include, but not limited to, emotion theories, the interplay between cognition and emotion, the physiological underpinnings of emotion and its associated outcomes. A range of formats, including lectures, student presentations, and guest seminars, will be used to engage students on these topics.",
