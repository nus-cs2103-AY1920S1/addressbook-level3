    "description": "Modern public policy experts need a solid grounding in economics to be able to craft policies that take into account the economic factors that affect nearly all aspects of policy making. The first half of this course introduces the principles of microeconomics and applications are introduced via cases on externalities, taxation and public goods, regulation and competition policy, and trade policy. The second half deals with the tools of macroeconomic policy. Topics include macroeconomic indicators, exchange rate determination, inflation, policies for economic growth and stabilization. Cases cover topical issues such as current account imbalances, exchange rate dynamics, and financial crises.",
