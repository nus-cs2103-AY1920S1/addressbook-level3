== About the Project
This Project Portfolio is intended to document and detail my personal contributions to my software engineering project
for the module CS2103T Software Engineering. In this module, me and my team of four other software engineering
coursemates were tasked with morphing a given codebase for a desktop app that primarily made use of typed input to
receive instructions. We decided to morph the app into an all-in-one study aid application named *StudyBuddyPro*,
targeted specifically at NUS Computer Science students who preferred visual learning. Our app supports the use of
flashcards and notes, provides a timetrial and reminder feature for flashcards, and includes an automatic
cheatsheet-generation tool.

The image below displays the current Graphical User Interface (GUI) of StudyBuddyPro:

My role in this project was to write the code for Notes, implement their basic functions, and implement the ability
to add tags within the content of notes. Additionally, I was tasked with completing the test cases, user guide, and
developer guide portions for the entire Notes feature, and any other relevant documentation. This Project Portfolio
thus details how I implemented these changes.

== Summary of Contributions

As mentioned earlier, these are my contributions to my software engineering project:

* *Major Contribution 1*: Implemented *Notes*, along with their basic features.
** *What*: Notes are pieces of information that contain a title, some content, and some tags. They can be added,
deleted, viewed, and filtered.
** *Why*: Notes can be used by students to store information. They form one of the two main sources of information for
cheatsheet creation in StudyBuddyPro, and are therefore essential to the studying process.

* *Major Contribution 2*: Implemented the *Add Tags Within Notes* feature.
** *What*: This feature allows the user to use a pre-defined syntax to tag specific portions of a note with tags (these
tags are henceforth referred to as 'note fragment tags'). Note fragment tags are independent of the note's original
tags, and can be filtered just like normal notes can be.
** *Why*: This feature can be used by students to add information to cheatsheets much more precisely. It can also be
used to highlight specific important parts of a note. This would be very helpful for students to revise more
efficiently.

* *Minor Contribution 1*: Implemented the `view` and `viewraw` commands for Notes.
** *What*: Both commands view a given note, but the `view` command also cleans up the syntax of the note
to remove the leftover syntax from the addition of note fragment tags.
** *Why*: Users will not want the GUI of the app to be cluttered up by note fragment tag syntax. It will be more
aesthetically pleasing to have the option to not view the syntax when viewing a note.

* *Code Contributed*: This link contains the code that I wrote for this project: https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=sam-limyr&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Sam-limyr&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[My code]

== Contributions to User Guide

In this project, I was tasked with writing all portions of the User Guide related to Notes (specifically Section 6 of
the User Guide). The sections below hence document my contributions to the User Guide of StudyBuddyPro. In the
following 3 pages, I will describe how you can add and view notes from StudyBuddyPro, in an easy-to-follow manner.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All the operations in this section assume that you are in the _notes_ mode. To be sure
you are in the _notes_ mode, please ensure that you have used the `switch notes` command before this.

== Contributions to Developer Guide

In this project, I was tasked with writing all portions of the Developer Guide related to Notes (specifically
Sections 3.4 and 4.7 of the Developer Guide). The sections below hence document my contributions to the Developer
Guide of StudyBuddyPro. In the following 5 pages, I will detail out how I decided on and created my feature. I will
also describe the architecture of my feature using various types of diagrams, so that you can more clearly understand
how the feature works.

=== Implementation of Notes

`Notes` contain a `Title` and a `Content`, with optional `Tags` and `NoteFragments`, as shown in the class diagram
below:

.An overview of the Note class and its associated classes
image::samDiagrams/NoteModelClassDiagram.png[pdfwidth=50vw]

[NOTE]
====
As is standard in this Developer Guide, red classes are part of the `Model` package, and blue classes are part of
the `Logic` package.
====

=== Implementation of the Add Tags Within Notes feature

In the following section, I will describe in general how I implemented the Add Tags Within Notes feature, which
allows users to store specific sections of their notes with tags.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=notesImplementationIntro]

.A detailed view of the Note, NoteFragment, and NoteFeatureUtil classes
image::samDiagrams/NoteModelDetailedClassDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70vw]

As shown in the diagram above, `NoteFragments` contain:

** A `Title` that is the same as their parent `Note`
** A `Content` that is a substring of their parent `Note`
** Any indicated `Tags` that are independent of their parent `Note`

=== Implementation of NoteFragment creation

In the following section, I will describe how I implemented the creation of `NoteFragments`. While `Notes`
themselves are quite useful, I felt that implementing `NoteFragments` would allow users to gain even more value out
of the automatic cheatsheet-generation feature in StudyBuddyPro.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=notesImplementationNoteFeatureUtil1]

A `Note` has been added with the `Content` of 'Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if
needed.', and a note fragment tag with `Content` 'highlighted' and two `Tags` 'cs2100' and 'important'. The `Note`
itself is instead tagged with the `Tag` 'about'.

[NOTE]
====
You can refer to the earlier pages of this Portfolio to recall the specific syntax used in note fragment tags.
====

The following sequence diagram elaborates upon the creation process of `Notes` and `NoteFragments`:

.Illustration of how Notes and NoteFragments are created
image::samDiagrams/AddNoteSequenceDiagramZoomedIn.png[pdfwidth=50vw]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=notesImplementationNoteFeatureUtil2]

=== Implementation of ViewNoteCommand

In the following section, I will describe how I implemented `ViewNoteCommand`. I chose to implement this command
because users might not want to see complicated syntax when they are viewing notes.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=notesImplementationView1]

.Difference between ViewNoteCommand and ViewRawNoteCommand
image::samDiagrams/ViewVersusViewRawActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth=50vw]

As can be seen in the diagram above, the method `Note#getContentCleanedFromTags()` is used to obtain a copy of the
`Content` of the `Note`, and reformat it by replacing its note fragment tags with blank spaces. This is further
elaborated on by the object diagram below:

.A possible instance of a use of ViewNoteCommand
image::samDiagrams/NoteCleanedContentObjectDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70vw]

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=notesImplementationView2]

=== Design Considerations of the Add Tags Within Notes feature and ViewNoteCommand

In the following section, I will describe two of the decisions that I had to make while creating my feature, and will
elaborate on the pros and cons of each choice.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the architectural components mentioned in these alternatives (e.g. `UniqueNoteList`) are not mentioned in
this Portfolio. Should you wish to read up more about them, you can refer to the full Developer Guide https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[here].
