== Introduction

_Billboard_ is for those who prefer to use desktop applications to manage and keep track of their expenses.
_Billboard_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still enjoying all the benefits of having a fully fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, _Billboard_ can help you manage your expenses faster than traditional
GUI apps!

_Billboard's_ basic functionality involves the adding, editing and delete of expenses, which are saved locally in your computer
in a simple, human readable format (.JSON). In top of that, _Billboard_ provides a host of additional features designed to
simplify, enhance, improve, and make convenient your management of expenses. These features will be further detailed below.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your machine.
. Download the latest version of _Billboard_ https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-4/main/releases/tag/v1.1[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the Home folder for _Billboard_
. Double-click the file to open the application
. Refer to <<Features>> for the details of each command

[[Features]]
== Features

{nbsp} +
====
*Command Format*

* Parameters in the format `prefix/[SQUARE BRACKETS]` are _mandatory parameters_ to be supplied by the user
e.g. in `add n/[NAME] a/[AMOUNT]`, `NAME` and `AMOUNT` are mandatory parameters which should be supplied, as in: `add n/buy a book a/10.00`.
* The mandatory parameters can be in any order.
* Some commands may have _optional parameters_. These are denoted by using `prefix/<ANGULAR BRACKETS>`,
e.g When you see `a/<AMOUNT>`, the command can be either `edit 2 n/lunch a/10` or `edit 2 n/lunch`.
* Default values can be specified in the angular brackets, e.g `prefix/<NUM_ENTRIES = 10>`. If the user does not
provide a value for that parameter, it will default to the default value stated.
* Optional parameters can be in any order.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times e.g. `t/<TAG>...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/bills` or even `t/bills t/fees` etc.
* Additional information on the parameters can be detailed in a section labelled `INFO` under the format if necessary.

// tag::archive[]
=== Archiving past expenses: `archive`
This feature allows you to archive expenses. An expense is archived when you want remove it from
the current list of expenses, but still want to keep a record of it and retrieve it again in the future
for accounting purposes.

Archiving expenses allows you to de-clutter your current list of expenses after a long period of time.
This feature offers greater flexibility in terms of expense organisation as it allows you to create *multiple archives* with
the archive name of your choice so that you would be able to appropriately group your archived expenses.

NOTE: *Archived expenses cannot be edited.* +
Archived expenses are not considered current and "active" expenses so you are unable to edit them. +
You would need to unarchive an expense first before you would be able to perform expense editing commands on it such as
`edit`, `tag add` and `tag remove` commands.

Although this section of the user guide provides comprehensive information on the usage of `archive` commands,
you could also view the list of all supported archive commands within the application by typing the command word `archive`
into the command box and pressing `Enter`:

.The result box will display the list of supported `archive` commands. You can scroll down to view the full list.
image::archiveCommandMessage.png[]

The following are all the archive commands, descriptions of how they work and their usage.

Note the formatting of command parameters used in this section:

* [INDEX]: The list index of the expense involved in the command.
* `arc/`: Prefix to indicate that the text appended to it is the specified archive name.
* [ARCHIVE NAME]: Specified name of archive involved in the command. Archive name is case-sensitive and must be non-empty. Names with symbols and multiple words are accepted as well.

==== _Adding an expense to an archive: ``archive add``_ +
This command allows you to transfer the expense at the specified index to your specified archive. +

* 2a. *There is no existing archive called "_movies_"* +
A new archive called "_movies_" is created before "_joker movie tickets_" is added to it. +
The result box will display the message to indicate the archive creation and transfer of the expense:
+
image::archiveAddArchiveCreatedMessage.png[]

* 2b. *There is an existing archive called "_movies_"* +
"_joker movie tickets_" is simply added to the existing "_movies_" archive. +
The result box will display the message to indicate the transfer of the expense:
+

This command allows you to view the list of expenses of your specified archive. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 archive list [ARCHIVE NAME]

NOTE: You do not need to prepend the archive prefix `arc/` to the archive name as there are no other
arguments (like [INDEX]) to be entered for this command.

Example:

Suppose you want to view all the expenses you have spend on movies this year. As you have kept all movie expenses in an archive called
"_movies_", you can execute this command to bring up the expense list in "_movies_":

{nbsp} +
Usage:

 archive delete [INDEX] arc/[ARCHIVE NAME]

Example:

Suppose you want to delete the expense "_Avengers Endgame_" from the "_movies_" archive as you know you will never need to retrieve again for future reference. +
To delete "_Avengers Endgame_" from its archive:

1. Enter the `archive list movies` command to display the expense list of the "_movies_" archive. Refer to the `archive list` section above for the diagram to execute this step.
2. With the expense list of "_movies_" displayed, type `archive delete 1 arc/movies` and press `Enter`:
+
."Avengers Endgame" expense has an index of 1 in its archive list.
image::archiveDeleteEnterCommand.png[]

3. The next step can be split into two scenarios:
* 3a. *"_Avengers Endgame_" is the only expense in the "_movies_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted so the "_movies_" archive is now empty, and will thus be deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the deletion of "_Avengers Endgame_" and "_movies_", and the list displayed will switch back to the main expense list:
+
.Since the archive is deleted, the list displayed switches back to the main expense list.
image::archiveDeleteEmptyArchive.png[]

* 3b. *"_Avengers Endgame_" is not the only expense in the "_movies_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted. As there are other expenses still in the "_movies_" archive, the archive is not deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the deletion of "_Avengers Endgame_", and the archive list displayed updates with the removal of "_Avengers Endgame_":
+
."_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted and this change is immediately reflected in the archive list displayed.
image::archiveDeleteNonEmptyArchive.png[]

{nbsp} +

==== _Reverting an archived expense: archive revert_ +
This command allows you to revert/unarchive the expense at the specified index from your specified archive, transferring it back to your current list of expenses. +

{nbsp} +
Usage:

 archive revert [INDEX] arc/[ARCHIVE NAME]

Example: +
Suppose you have an expense "_Airpod Pro_" archived into "_gadgets_", but you changed your mind and decided that it should not be archived yet. +
To unarchive/revert the "_Airpod Pro_" expense:

1. Enter the `archive list gadgets` command to display the expense list of the "_gadgets_" archive. Refer to the `archive list` section above for the diagram to execute this step.
2. With the expense list of "_gadgets_" displayed, type `archive revert 2 arc/gadgets` and press `Enter`:
+
."Airpod Pro" expense has an index of 2 in its archive list.
image::archiveRevertEnterCommand.png[]

3. The next step can be split into two scenarios:
* 3a. *"_Airpod Pro_" is the only expense in the "_gadgets_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Airpod Pro_" is removed from the "_gadgets_" archive, so the archive is now empty, and will thus be deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the transfer of "_Airpod Pro_" and the deletion of "_gadgets_", and the list displayed will switch back to the main expense list:
+
.Since the archive is deleted, the list displayed switches back to the main expense list and "_Airpod Pro_" can be observed to be back in the main expense list.
image::archiveRevertEmptyArchive.png[]

* 3b. *"_Airpod Pro_" is not the only expense in the "_gadgets_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Airpod Pro_" is removed from the "_gadgets_" archive. As there are other expenses still in the "_gadgets_" archive, the archive is not deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the transfer of "_Airpod Pro_", and the archive list displayed updates with the removal of "_Airpod Pro_":
+
."_Airpod Pro_" is unarchived and this change is immediately reflected in the archive list displayed.

// tag::statistics[]

=== Displaying of statistics: `display-stats`

image::statisticsIntro.png[]

{nbsp} +

Billboard has a powerful statistics display system! While trying out other features, you may have realized that the highlighted chart changes from time to time.
That is because Billboard has a _fully responsive_ statistics display with charts that dynamically update themselves. You can simply enter any command that changes the displayed
list of expenses, such as `add n/automatic stats displays are cool a/50.00`, and watch as the chart updates automatically.

.Live statistics display in action upon adding an expense.
image::live-statistics-demo.gif[]
{nbsp} +


Should you want to view different types of statistics and customize the information you get, Billboard also supports various different types of
charts, with a plethora of different customization options. Read the documentation on individual commands below to find out more.

[NOTE]
The options available are tailored to each specific chart type and thus, not all charts may support the same options. The individual sections
for each command goes into further detail about the supported options for that command.


With this, it becomes effortless for you to perform advanced queries on specific types of statistics! For example,
if you want to track the weekly total spending of all your expenses that contain the word "food" over a specific month, simply type `display-stats timeline interval/week`
followed by `find d/food sd/01/01/2019 ed/01/02/2019`. (Unsure about this command? Refer to <<Find>> for more information). +
{nbsp} +


==== _Display timeline overview of expenses: display-stats timeline_ +

.Timeline of all expenses
image::display-timeline-example-normal.png[]
{nbsp} +

You can view one or more timelines that are based on your currently displayed expenses. Upon entering the command, the statistic chart will automatically update to display a timeline configured with the options you have provided.
The expenses over a specified time period are aggregated and added as data points on the timeline, allowing you to easily keep track of your relative spending. You can customize the date interval used, as well as the groupings used to split your expenses into each individual timeline. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 display-stats timeline interval/<DATE INTERVAL = MONTH> groupby/<GROUPING = NONE>


INFO:

* `DATE_INTERVAL`: Specifies the date interval to be used to aggregate the expenses by. Supported date intervals include 'day', 'week', 'month' and 'year'.
The start date of each interval will always be the "logical" start, ie. the start date for "week" will always be a Monday and the start date for "month" will always be the 1st of that month.

* `GROUPING`: Specifies the grouping to use to group the expenses into each separate timeline. Supported groupings include "none", "tag", "month" and "day-of-week".

{nbsp} +

Example: +
`display-stats timeline interval/month groupby/tag` +
Displays timelines based on the displayed expenses. First, the expenses are divided based on tag, forming one timeline for every tag. Next, for each timeline, the total amount spent each week, starting from Monday and ending on Sunday, is totalled to form each data point. The chart may look something like this: +

.Chart after executing the above command
image::display-timeline-example-tag.png[]
{nbsp} +

[NOTE]
The options for this command, and for all other `display-stats` commands, are case-sensitive, ie. "Week" is not a valid substitute for "week".
{nbsp} +


==== _Display breakdown of expenses: display-stats breakdown_ +

.Breakdown of expenses grouped by month.
image::display-breakdown-example-month.png[]
{nbsp} +

You can break the displayed expenses down into smaller groups and view that breakdown as a pie chart, allowing you to compare your spending between groups. Upon entering the command, the statistic chart will automatically update to display a breakdown chart configured with the options you have provided. The total
expenses per category are totalled and displayed as each slice in the pie chart. You can customize the criteria used to split the expenses into groups. +

{nbsp} +
Usage:

 display-stats breakdown groupby/<GROUPING = TAG>

{nbsp} +
INFO:

* `GROUPING`: Specifies the grouping to use to group the expenses into each separate slice in the pie chart.
Supported groupings include "none", "tag", "month" and "day-of-week". Note that the default value for `GROUPING` for this command is not "none", but "tag". (The "none" option has limited use). +
{nbsp} +


Example: +
`display-stats breakdown groupby/MONTH` +

Shows a pie chart breakdown by month of all currently displayed expenses. Within each grouping, the total expenses in that grouping are summed up, and the
total amount determines the size of its slice of the pie chart.
{nbsp} +


==== _Display heatmap of expenses: display-stats heatmap_ +

.Heatmap of all expenses grouped by tags.
image::display-heatmap-example-tag.png[]
{nbsp} +

You can view a heatmap of total expenses per day for the currently displayed expenses, limited to the past year. The y-axis represents the day of the week the expense was made, while
the x-axis represents the week of the year the expense was made, with each bubble representing the expenses made on that particular day. The larger the bubble for the particular day, the higher the total expenses on that day.
This allows you to get an overall impression of your spending behaviours over the past year. +

{nbsp} +
Usage:

 display-stats heatmap groupby/<GROUPING = NONE>

INFO:

* GROUPING: Specifies the grouping to use to calculate the heatmap. Expenses from different groups that occur on the same day will not be totalled, and will instead form two separate bubbles of different colors.
Accepted values include: "none", "tag", "month", "day-of-week'.

{nbsp} +
Example: +
`display-stats heatmap groupby/none` +
Shows a heatmap of all currently displayed expenses, limited to a year. Since "none" grouping was specified, the expenses are not grouped and are all categorized under "All Expenses".
The displayed chart may look something like this: +
