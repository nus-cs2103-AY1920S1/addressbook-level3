Key topics will include the structure, juridical nature and obligational content of the aforementioned instruments; the nature of the harmonised regimes and their interaction with domestic law; the principle of strict compliance and its relaxation; documentary and non-documentary forms of recourse; the autonomy principle and its exceptions; and the conflict of laws principles applicable to autonomous payment undertakings.
