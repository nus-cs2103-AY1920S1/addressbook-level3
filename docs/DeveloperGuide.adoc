== Introduction
Welcome to ORGA__Nice__! ORGA__Nice__ is an organ transplant manager desktop application
specifically designed for hospital administration staff who prefer typing.

Do note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

NOTE: This section contains important information.

TIP: This section contains a helpful tip!

`find` A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command box
and executed by the application.

=== Purpose
This guide documents the software design and considerations
made during the development of ORGA__Nice__.

=== Intended audience
This guide is meant for developers who would like to further develop ORGA__Nice__.

== Setting up
To set up the developer tools needed to develop ORGA__Nice__, refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section provides a high-level overview of ORGA__Nice__'s codebase.
It is divided into 6 subsections:

* Architecture
* UI component
* Logic component
* Model component
* Storage component
* Common classes

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The Architecture section is meant to explain the high-level design of ORGA__Nice__.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The `main` folder contains two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for performing the following tasks:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. For example,
the `LogsCenter` class is in the `Commons` collection because it is used by many classes
to write log messages to the ORGA__Nice__'s log file.

The rest of ORGA__Nice__ consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario when a user
issues the command `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim`.

.Component interactions for `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section explains the design of the UI component. +
Figure 4 below depicts the classes in the UI component and their relationships with one another.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section explains the design of the Logic component. +
Figure 5 below depicts the classes in the Logic component and their relationships with one  another.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit ic/S5678908D n/Mr Lim")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim` Command
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// tag::modeldiagram[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width=630]
// end::modeldiagram[]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `ORGA__Nice__.commons` package.

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how features in ORGA__Nice__ are implemented.

// tag::list[]
=== List feature
This section describes how the list feature is implemented.

The list feature is implemented using the `ListCommand(Type type)`. When the list command is executed,
the method `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` takes in a predicate
to decide what type of `Person` to show on the `filteredPersons` list.

Therefore, in addition to the existing `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` predicate, three other predicates are introduced
in the `Model` interface to update the list.

The code snippet below shows what these predicates are:

``` java
    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS = unused -> true;

    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true if person is a doctor */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DOCTORS = person -> person.getType().isDoctor();

    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true  if person is a donor */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DONORS = person -> person.getType().isDonor();

    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true if person is a patient */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PATIENTS = person -> person.getType().isPatient();

```


The activity diagram below illustrates what happens when a user uses the list command.

.Activity Diagram of a List Command
image::ListActivityDiagram.png[width=450]

When the user enters a list command, the result differs depending on the parameter of the command.
If there is no parameter after 'list', ORGA__Nice__ will simply list all existing doctors, patients, and donors on the list.
If there is a parameter, ORGA__Nice__ will check if it is a valid `TYPE` parameter and display the correct list of persons
that corresponds to this type.
If the parameter is not valid, an error message will be displayed to indicate that the command is invalid.
// end::list[]


// tag::matching[]


=== Matching feature
This section explains the current implementation and design considerations of the matching feature.

Matching is facilitated by the `MatchCommand` class, which extends the `Command` class.
It implements the `MatchCommand#match(Person donor, Patient patient)` operation, which checks if the given patient and
donor have compatible blood and tissue types. For the context of this application, a patient and donor
pair with compatible blood and tissue types is considered as a potential match.


The following operations in `ModelManager` accesses the `match` method:

* `ModelManager#matchDonors(Patient patient)` -- Matches all donors in ORGA__Nice__ with the specified patient.
For each donor that potentially matches the patient, a `MatchedDonor` object is created to store
the compatibility rate of the donor with the patient.
* `ModelManager#matchPatients()` -- Matches all donors with all patients. For every patient in ORGA__Nice__,
a `MatchedPatient` object is created to store the number of donors that are potential matches with that patient.

`MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects are stored in an `ObservableList` called
`listOfMatches`. Contents of `listOfMatches` are copied to `displayedPersons`, which is another
`ObservableList` that can be accessed by `Logic` and is displayed by the `UI`
component.

Each time a user invokes the match feature, the contents of `listOfMatches` are deleted.
New `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects are created and stored in the list again.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the match feature works at each step:

Step 1. The user opens up the application with an existing list of patients and donors.
As seen in the diagram below, there are 2 `Patient` and 2 `Donor` objects in ORGANice,
and no objects in `listOfMatches`.

.Object diagram of initial state of ORGANice
image::MatchState0.png[]

Step 2. The user types in the command `match ic/all`. Each patient will be matched with
all donors via the `MatchCommand#match` operation. A `MatchedPatient` object is created
for each patient, which stores the number of potential donors the patient has. The figure below
illustrates this with the addition of `mp1` and `mp2`, which are `MatchedPatient` objects of
`p1` and `p2` respectively.

.State of ORGANice after matching all patients
image::MatchState1.png[]

Step 3. The user types in the command `match ic/**PATIENT NRIC**`, where **PATIENT NRIC** is the NRIC of a patient in
ORGA__Nice__.
Existing objects in the `listOfMatches` are removed.
For each potential donor of the specified patient, a `MatchedDonor`object is created,
accompanied with the compatibility rate.
As seen in the figure below, `mp1` and `mp2` are removed from `listOfMatches`.
MatchedDonor objects `md1` and `md2` are created to represent `d1` and `d2` respectively.
All `MatchedDonor` objects are then added to the `listOfMatches`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the match feature:

.Activity diagram of the match command
image::MatchActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design considerations
This section will explain some aspects that were considered when designing the match feature.

===== Aspect 1: Storage of match results
This section explores several choices of storing match results of patients and donors.

* **Choice 1 (current choice)**: Delete `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects
created in previous `MatchCommand` executions when there is a new `MatchCommand` executed.
** Pros: No need to write extra code to store match results in the hard disk. Previous match results are overriden with new results
from the latest match command.
A scenario in which this would be important is if a user matches a patient again after editing
the patient's information. The matching would be based on the updated patient's information.
** Cons: Redundant matching occurs in a scenario where the user
executes a match command with the same parameters twice.

* **Choice 2:** For each patient, keep a list of match results. After every `MatchCommand` is executed, save
the match results to the hard disk.
** Pros: A history of match results is stored, thus reducing redundant matching.
** Cons: More code to needs to be written to store match results to the hard disk.

==== Aspect 2: Display of match results
This section explains some considerations for displaying match results,
which are stored in `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects.

* **Choice 1 (current choice):**: Display `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects in `PersonListPanel`
** Pros: Easy to implement because additional code is added to `PersonListPanel`, which is a UI component already existing in
AddressBook 3.
The constructor of `PersonListPanel` takes in an `ObservableList<Person>` object and creates
a list of `PersonListViewCell` objects to be displayed.
** Cons: The `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` classes need to inherit from the `Person` class, even though they represent
match results, not people.
* **Choice 2:** Create a new list panel called `MatchListPanel`, which displays objects of the `Match` class.
`MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` classes extend from the `Match` class.
** Pros: `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` classes do not inherit unwanted methods from `Person` class.
The `Match` class can contain methods more specific to matching.
** Cons: There would be two types of list panels. Upon executing each command, the correct list panel must be selected
and displayed.


// end::matching[]

// tag::formmode[]
=== Form mode feature
This section explains the implementation of the form mode feature.

==== Implementation

The form mode mechanism is facilitated by `FormUiManager`.
It modifies the `CommandBox` as well as `PersonPanelListPlaceholder` each time you input a specific attribute.
The following object diagram models the relationship and dependencies between `FormUiManager` and other objects:

.Object Diagram for the `FormUiManager` object
image::FormUiManagerObjectDiagram.png[width="300"]

`FormUiManager` will need an object of class `Type` in order to determine what type of form(patient, doctor, or donor) will be displayed to you.

Additionally, `FormUiManager` implements the following operations:

* `FormUiManager#getPersonDetails()` -- Modifies `CommandBox` and prompts the user to input the attributes required.
* `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` -- Sets the value for all required attributes of a specific type of person.
* `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()` -- Adds a doctor to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()` -- Adds a patient to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` -- Adds a donor to the person list.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface when the specific command is invoked by you.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the form mode mechanism behaves at each step so that you can better understand how the different classes interact with each other:

Step 1. A user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add t/doctor` command to add a doctor in the form mode. The `add` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` that will return a new `AddCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` executes the command and notice that the `CommandResult` having a boolean value `isForm` and thus will create a new `FormUiManager` instance. The code snippet below demonstrates how the `FormUiManager` is created.

```
if (commandResult.isForm()) {
    resultDisplayPlaceholder.setMinHeight(100);
    FormAnimation.fadingAnimation(this);
    Type formType = commandResult.getFormType();
    FormUiManager formUiManager = new FormUiManager(this, formType, model, logger);
    personListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().clear();
    if (formType.isDoctor()) {
        form = new DoctorForm();
        personListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(((DoctorForm) form).getRoot());
    } else if (formType.isDonor()) {
        form = new DonorForm();
        personListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(((DonorForm) form).getRoot());
    } else if (formType.isPatient()) {
        form = new PatientForm(this);
                    personListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(((PatientForm) form).getRoot());
                }
                formUiManager.getPersonDetails();
                return commandResult;
            }
```

Step 4. The `FormUiManager` changes the display of the application based on the type of the person specified in Step 1 by modifying the content of the `PersonListPanelPlaceholder` as well as the `CommandExecutor` in the `CommandBox` object by calling `FormUiManager#getPersonDetails()`.

Step 5. The user inputs the attribute that is prompted until all the required attributes are specified.

Step 6. The user confirms the details of the person and `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` will be called and depending on the type of the person specified, calling `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` respectively.

Step 7. `FormUiManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to add the person and save it in the `Storage` interface.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component when a user typed in `add t/doctor`

.Sequential Diagram for the form mode feature
image::AddFormSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when you execute the `add t/**TYPE**` command:

image::Form.png[width="300", height="300"]

==== Design Considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: How form mode feature executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same `add` command to do the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Easy to implement. This is the reason why this alternative is chosen as it does not take too much time to implement.
** Cons: May not be the best approach since one command will have two different modes.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new command for the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Will be less confusing for the user since there is a separate command for `Form` mode
** Cons: We must creates a new parser and command classes just to deal with another `add` functionality.
// end::formmode[]




// tag::sort[]

=== Sort feature
This section describes how the sort feature is implemented.

Sorting is done by using `Comparators` in the `Logic` component and makes use of the `SortCommand`.
This command only works after a `MatchCommand` is called by the user, because it takes in `listOfMatches` returned
from calling a `MatchCommand`. Importantly, this `listOfMatches` is an `ObservableList`, which cannot be modified.
Therefore, it makes use of `SortedList` to wrap around the `ObservableList` so that the list can be modified by sorting.
Thus far, the sort command can only take in one `String` parameter, but more methods can be added in the future for more sorting options.

Three methods of sorting are implemented to sort based on the following categories:

* Sorting based on donor's organ expiry date with `sort expiry`
+
* Sorting based on priority with `sort priority`
+
* Sorting based on compatibility rate of the match with `sort rate`

These three methods' implementation will be further elaborated upon below.

==== Sort by Expiry
Sorting by Expiry sorts a list of `MatchedDonor` with the `ModelManager#sortByOrganExpiryDate()` method.

In this method, the `ExpiryComparator` is used to compare two matched donors' organ expiry dates, and this requires
the `OrganExpiryDate` of the donors to be parsed into a data format that can be compared.

==== Sort by Compatibility Rate
Sorting by Compatibility Rate sorts a list of `MatchedPatient` using the `ModelManager#sortBySuccessRate()` method.

The `CompatibilityRateComparator` is created to compare two matched patients' rate of compatibility for the match.

Given below is a Sequence Diagram to show the interactions with the `Logic` component when executing the `execute(sort rate)` method,
assuming the user has entered a valid `match ic/**NRIC**` command before this.

.Sequential Diagram of the `sort rate` command
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width=600]

After the command is given by the user, it would be parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.
The `SortCommandParser` then parses the parameter `rate` and a `SortCommand` is created.
The `LogicManager` will then execute the command and call the `sortByCompatibilityRate()` method from the `ModelManager`.
The list of `MatchedPatient` will then be sorted based on their match's compatibility rate.

==== Sort by Priority
Sorting by Expiry sorts a list of `MatchedPatient` using the `ModelManager#sortByPriority()` method.

In this method, there are two other comparators created in addition to the `Priority Comparator`,
namely the `NameComparator` and the `NumOfMatchesComparator`. These two comparators serve as tie-breakers in cases where
patients have the same priority. In other words, for patients of the same priority, those with more matched donors will be displayed first.
If these two factors are the same for a group of patients, they will be displayed according to their names in alphabetical order.

Under the `sortByPriority()` method, the order of applying the comparators to the list of patients
is, firstly, the 'NameComparator', followed by `NumOfMatchesComparator`, and lastly, the `PriorityComparator`.
This means that the patients are first sorted by names in alphabetical order, followed by the number of matched donors they have
in descending order (highest to lowest), and then their priority level in descending order (from high, to medium, to low).

All three comparators makes use of the `compareTo` method under the `Comparable` class, which can sort in lexical order for String,
and numeric order for Sorting integers.
In particular, the `PriorityComparator` makes use of the `compareTo` method implemented in the `Priority` class.
A code snippet of this method is shown below.

``` java
@Override
public int compareTo(Priority priority) {
Integer thisPriorityNumber = 0;
Integer otherPriorityNumber = 0;

        if (this.isHighPriority()) {
            thisPriorityNumber = 3;
        } else if (this.isMediumPriority()) {
            thisPriorityNumber = 2;
        } else if (this.isLowPriority()) {
            thisPriorityNumber = 1;
        }
        if (priority.isHighPriority()) {
            otherPriorityNumber = 3;
        } else if (priority.isMediumPriority()) {
            otherPriorityNumber = 2;
        } else if (priority.isLowPriority()) {
            otherPriorityNumber = 1;
        }
        return thisPriorityNumber.compareTo(otherPriorityNumber);
    }
```

This implementation is the result of using `String` to represent the different priorities in the `Priority` class.
Therefore, they are converted into `Integer` for easier comparison. An alternative solution would be to make use of
`Enum` class to define each priority so that this `compareTo` method implementation can be simplified.

==== Design considerations
This section will explain two aspects considered in designing the sort feature.

===== Aspect: Method of storing the sorted result
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `SortedList`.
** Pros: Fast iteration time of O(n * log n), which is important for ORGA__Nice__ to load and display the sorted result, and more harmonious
with current implementations (able to wrap `ObservableList` and sort the content).
** Cons: Not the most efficient algorithm for insertions or deletions, but ORGA__Nice__ does not require them.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `ArrayList`.
** Pros: Fast index-based access and works on any `Collection` class.
** Cons: Slower than `SortedList` as it takes O(n) time to iterate and display the results.

===== Aspect: Method of sorting
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Comparator` and `Comparable`.
** Pros: Simpler implementation as able to make use of existing methods in ORGA__Nice__ such as `setComparator`.
** Cons: More coding involved.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Collections.sort()`.
** Pros: Has a time complexity of O(n*log(n)) which is relatively fast.
** Cons: Cannot make use of existing methods in ORGA__Nice__ that work for Comparator.
// end::sort[]

// tag::processingDG[]

=== Processing feature
This section describes how the processing feature is implemented.

Processing is facilitated by the `ProcessingCommand` class, which extends the `Command` class.

Processing is done by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`,
then creating a `ProcessingList` which acts like ArrayList to store the tasks which needs to be done.

It implements the `ProcessingCommand#isValidDonorPatientPair(Nric firstNric, Nric secondNric, Model model)` boolean operation. +
This method will first determine which Nric belongs to a patient and which Nric belongs to a donor
since the input allows user to give two Nric in no particular order. +
It will also get the `Donor` and `Patient` objects with the NRIC given. +
Then, it will check if the donor have a `ProcessingList` generated before. +
If the donor have an empty `ProcessingList`, it means that the donor is newly processed. +
Hence, it will mean that the donor may be able to pair with the given patient. +
If the donor already have a `ProcessingList`, it means that the donor is already being processed with a patient. +
Then, this method will check if the patient given by the user is the same patient being processed together with this donor. +
This is done by checking the `Patient` attribute that is tagged to the `ProcessingList` of the donor. +
Finally, the method will check if the patient and donor given by the user is valid by checking if
they are able to be matched or not and if they exist in ORGA__Nice__. +
A code snippet of the method is shown below: This code aims to get the `Donor` and `Patient` from the given Nrics given by the user. +
This method is necessary since user is able to give the Nrics input in no particular order.
```
if (model.hasDonor(firstNric)) {
    donorNric = firstNric;
    donor = model.getDonor(donorNric);

    patientNric = secondNric;
    patient = model.getPatient(patientNric);
} else {
    patientNric = firstNric;
    patient = model.getPatient(patientNric);

    donorNric = secondNric;
    donor = model.getDonor(donorNric);
}
```

`Status` class is also  created and it is one of the attributes of `Patient` and `Donor`.
However, this cannot be edited or added by users. +
The status of the 'Patient' and 'Donor' will change when Processing command is executed on that pair of patient and donor.

* When a new `Patient` or `Donor` object is created, the `Status` of the new object will be set to `not processing`.

* When the `Processing` command is being executed, `Status` of the `Patient` and the `Donor` will be changed to `processing`,
provided that the `Patient` and `Donor` are valid.

* When the `Done` command is being executed, `Status` of the `Patient` and the `Donor` will be changed to `done`,
provided that the `Patient` and `Donor` are valid.

If the donor and patient have never been processed before, a default `ProcessingList` will be generated and it will belong to the patient and donor pair uniquely.

If the user makes any changes to the `ProcessingList`, the list will be saved to the donor as one of its attribute which takes in a parameter of the patient's NRIC.

When the user executes the processing feature, the method, `ProcessingCommand#isValidDonorPatientPair(Nric firstNric, Nric secondNric, Model model)` will be called
to determine if the user give a valid patient and donor input. +
It will then check if there is a need to generate a new default task list or the donor already have a list tagged to itself. +
Then, the `Status` of the patient and donor will be set to `processing`.
It will then display the list out.

Following is an activity diagram to show the processing feature.

.Activity Diagram of the Processing Command
image::ProcessingActivity.png[]

//Todo: additional feature such as add, edit and delete tasks

// end::processingDG[]

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Method of storing the `ProcessingList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a new class, `TaskList` that works like ArrayList.
** Pros: Able to implement more specific methods for the ProcessingList.
** Cons: More methods and test cases needed which are harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Use ArrayList to store the tasks.
** Pros: Easy to implement as the default methods are already created.
** Cons: Future extension on this will be difficult as the `ProcessingList` is unique to this feature.

===== Aspect: Using specific prefixes for Nric inputs
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Nrics of patient and donor can be inputted in no particular order.
** Pros: More user friendly as users do not need to make sure the Nric must be in correct order. (For example, patient's Nric must come before donor's Nric)
** Cons: It is harder to implement and more exceptions need to be taken care of.
* **Alternative 2:** Using specific prefixes for Nric input to differentiate the Nrics of donor and patient.
** Pros: It is easier to implement as `icP/PATIENT NRIC` and `icD/DONOR NRIC` will be easier to parse to the Command method.
** Cons: It is less user friendly as users need to remember more prefixes for this entire application.

// tag::processingMarkDoneDG[]

=== ProcessingMarkDone feature
This section describes how the processingMarkDone feature is implemented.

ProcessingMarkDone is facilitated by the `ProcessingMarkDoneCommand` class, which extends the `Command` class.

ProcessingMarkDone is done by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`,
then, it will get the `ProcessingList` from the `Donor` and then marking a task as done.

It implements the `ProcessingMarkDoneCommand#isValidDonorPatientPair(Nric firstNric, Nric secondNric, Model model)` boolean operation. +
This method works similar to `ProcessingCommand#isValidDonorPatientPair(Nric firstNric, Nric secondNric, Model model)` method but with a slight difference. +
This method just need to check the `Status` of the `Donor` and `Patient` object and make sure it is `processing`. +
However, this method still need to determine which Nric belongs to a patient and which Nric belongs to a donor
since the input allows user to give two Nric in no particular order. +
A code snippet of the method is shown below: This part of the method is different from the `ProcessingCommand#isValidDonorPatientPair(Nric firstNric, Nric secondNric, Model model)` method.

```
if (model.hasPatient(patientNric) && model.hasDonor(donorNric)
        && patient.getStatus().isProcessing() && donor.getStatus().isProcessing()
        && match(donor, patient)) {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}
```

When the user execute the processingMarkDone feature, the method, `ProcessingMarkDoneCommand#isValidDonorPatientPair(Nric firstNric, Nric secondNric, Model model)` will be called
to determine if the user give a valid patient and donor input. +
It will also check if the task number given is valid. +
Then, it will call `Donor#markTaskAsDone(int taskNumber)` to mark the task on the `ProcessingList` of that donor.
It will then display the list out.

=== Done feature
This section describes how the done feature is implemented.

Done is facilitated by the `DoneCommand` class, which extends the `Command` class.

Done is executed by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`,
then determine if the patient and donor can match each other or not.

It implements the `DoneCommand#isPass(String result)` boolean operation. +
This method checks whether the result of the cross-matching test. +

If the patient and donor did a cross-matching test and the result of the test is a fail,
then the patient and donor needs to be sent back to find new matches and they
should not be able to match each other anymore. +
`Donor` will have an ArrayList `patientsMatchedBefore` which stores all the patients' Nric which fails to match with it.
Then, the patient and donor will have their `Status` set to `not processing` so that they can find another match and be considered in future matching results.

If the patient and donor did a cross-matching test and the result of the test is a pass,
then the patient and donor can be removed from ORGA__Nice__ already.

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having an aspect.

===== Aspect:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** To remove the patient and donor details if they pass the cross-matching test.
** Pros: It is easier to implement given the short amount of time we have to complete this project.
** Cons: It will be harder for users to do data analysis regarding the past successful matches.
* **Alternative 2:** Archive the details of patient and donor.
** Pros: The data can be accessed for analysis.
** Cons: It is harder to implement and space taken may increase exponentially.

// tag::find[]
=== Finding feature
This section explains the implementation of the find persons by attributes feature.

==== Current Implementation
The find feature is facilitated by `PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate` and `FindCommand`. +

===== PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate
`PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate` implements `Predicate` and is used to test whether a person's attributes
match exactly with at least one of the input keywords in each attribute category.

===== FindCommand
`FindCommand` extends `Command` with a `predicate` that is used to determine whether a given
`person` should be displayed. It implements `Command#execute(Model model)` which replaces the
`predicate` of the current `model.filteredPersons` with the input predicate of `ExactFindCommand`.
This triggers a change in the displayed persons to the list of filtered persons.

===== Execution Behaviour
The behaviour of `FindCommand` is consistent with that of other commands as described in <<Design-Logic>>.
Therefore, this section will gloss over higher-level details and instead zoom-in to the behaviour of
`FindCommand#execute`.

====== FindCommand Execution
Given below is a step by step description of the behaviour of `FindCommand#execute`:

Step 1: The full list of all persons in ORGA__Nice__ is retrieved and stored as `allPersons`.

Step 2: A list of exact matches is obtained by filtering `allPersons` using
`PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate`.

Step 3: A list containing all persons except exact matches is obtained and fuzzy matching is performed on it.

Step 4: Fuzzy matching uses `StringUtil#calculateLevenshteinDistance` to filter out possible matches. The matches
are then sorted in ascending order of similarity to input keywords.

Step 5: `#setDisplayedPersonList` is called.

The following sequence diagram illustrates steps 1 to 5: +

image::ExactFindSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The above diagram heavily simplifies the execution of `#fuzzyMatch` as it is further explained in the
section below.

====== Fuzzy Matching
`FindCommand#execute` performs fuzzy matching between input keywords and person attributes to detect possible
matches. This behaviour is facilitated by
`FindCommand#fuzzyMatch(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap, List<Person> inputList)`. The behaviour of
`#fuzzyMatch` is detailed in the below activity diagram:

image::FuzzyMatchActivityDiagram.png[]

As seen from the above diagram, `#fuzzyMatch` traverses the `inputList` of persons and tags each person with a
calculated minimum `combinedLevenshteinDistance`(LD). In the event that no keywords are present, all persons are
tagged with an LD higher than the acceptable threshold. Once all persons have been tagged, those persons whose LD
exceeds the threshold are removed from the list. The final list is then sorted in ascending order of LD.

==== Design Considerations
This section will explain the main aspect considered in designing the find by prefix feature.

===== Aspect: Method of calculating similarity of keywords
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate Levenshtein Distance.
** Pros: Able to detect most typos effectively.
** Cons: Creation of requisite `costMatrix` is computationally expensive and may affect performance for long
keywords.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Natural Language Processing Libraries.
** Pros: Will be able to detect typos more effectively.
** Cons: Will take up more system resources.

=== Logging
We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
