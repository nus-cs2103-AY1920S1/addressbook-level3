    "description": "This module introduces students to a range of issues, approaches and working procedures in applied linguistics, partly to familiarize students with relevant research, and more especially to engage students actively in typical processes of enquiry. Applied linguistics has evolved into a dynamically diversified, multi-disciplinary field of academic and professional activity. It is characterized by theoretically and empirically informed initiatives to identify and represent clearly, investigate appropriately, and address pragmatically and critically those issues and problems in human communicative affairs that prominently involve language, language learning or language use.",
