    "description": "Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules used to manipulate them. Throughout the history of mathematics, algebraic methods have been developed to solve equations using simple, but important, properties of numbers that make meaningful calculations possible. Those properties arise in a variety of other settings, however, allowing us to make algebraic arguments in a significantly broader context. This course introduces modern algebra \u2014 specifically the mathematical objects called groups and rings \u2014 through a rigorous exploration of familiar notions, including permutations, symmetries, polynomials, and matrices, resulting in a cohesive, unifying theory with far-reaching applications throughout the natural sciences.",
