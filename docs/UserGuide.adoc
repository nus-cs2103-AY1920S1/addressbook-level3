== Introduction

FinSec is a Financial Planner that helps the finance secretaries of any department in National University of Singapore,
preferably from the School of Computing so that they would be more likely to like the idea of having a Command Line Interface (CLI) app.
The app focuses on the tracking of claims that will help the While FinSec has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), its main form of input is CLI based,
thus favoring people who can type fast. +

We are the solution to all of your organisation's financial needs.

What are you waiting for? Download the app now and enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `finsec.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
<<Ui>> shows the UI of the application upon booting up.
[[Ui]]
[reftext="Figure 2.1"]
[caption="Figure 2.1: "]
.Finsec's UI when you open up the application
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add_contact`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/john@example.com` : adds a contact named John Doe to FinSec.
* **`delete_contact`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

 `NAME`, `DESCRIPTION`, `CASH AMOUNT`, `DATE`, `PHONE NUMBER` are parameters that the user has to type in.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

// tag::shortcutfeature[]

=== Creating a shortcut

Accidentally typed a command that is not in FinSec? Don't worry! FinSec will recognise that it is an unknown command and is smart enough to make that unknown entry into a shortcut!

Upon entering an unknown command, FinSec will prompt you as to whether you would like that as a new shortcut or if it was just a mistake.

*Choice 1 :* You can enter the keyword `n` to continue as per usual.

*Choice 2 :* You can enter any `existing commands` to map your previous entry to it!

If you have made a mistake and entered the wrong command,  *Choice 1* would allow you to continue.

==== Example of *Choice 1* :

****
User : add_conagtact

FinSec: Create shortcut? To which command? If no, type "n"

User : n
****

Result:

No shortcut is created. Continue using FinSec as per normal!

<<UG-NoShortcutexample1>>, <<UG-NoShortcutExample2>> and <<UG-NoShortcutResult>> shows what you can expect to see after typing in the example: `add_conagtact`.

==== Example of *Choice 2* :

****
User : ai

FinSec: Create shortcut? To which command? If no, type "n"

User: add_income

FinSec: New shortcut created! ai to add_income
****

Result:

A new shortcut is created for you! From now on, `ai` can be used as a substitute for `add_income`!

[source, java]
The 3 features below are made to be used in conjunction with each other. They are `goto`, `check` and `sort`/`reverse` respectively. They are an implementation of the other objects created in this application. You will be able to use these 3 features smoothly once you have input objects like `claim`, `income` into FinSec. You would then be able to switch between the different "tabs" that we call as `View`. Once you are in the specific `View` that displays the list of objects you created. You can`sort` or `reverse` this list. The list will then be sorted into a more organised manner for you. Once you have sorted the list, you can then use the `check` feature in the `contact` or `claim` View to sieve out a specific contact or claim that interests you. Now that you have gotten a clearer picture of how these 3 features will work together, read on to know more specific details about each feature.
// end::introduction[]

// tag::gotofeature[]
=== Changing Views : `goto`

This command changes the displayed list to show Contacts, Claims or Incomes. Such a command allows you to switch
between the 3 lists easily. This feature has also been enhanced with the addition of tabs below the Command Result panel.
These tabs give the same functionality as this goto feature so that you can choose to type or click on the tabs. +

<<UG-GotoExample>> shows the command result panel after the `goto contacts` command has been entered
as well as the tabs that are below this panel.

=== Checking a Contact or Claim : `check`

This feature allows you to check an individual `Contact` or `Claim` in either lists. This will give you a clearer view of the 2 different objects
that you need. This function in the contacts list will give you a pop-up of the contact and show you the basic details of this
contact and most importantly, the claims that are under this contact. +

As for the check in the claims list, it will show you the details of the claim in a pop-up too. There is however a difference that
you should take note of:

* The index used in this check in claims list is actually referring to the claimID of the `claim`.
* From the contacts page, you can check the claimIDs that belong to a certain contact that you want to check.
* You can then go to the claims list and enter `check CLAIMID` with this `CLAIMID` parameter as the specific claim
that you want to see in clearer view.

Keyword: `check`

Format: `check INDEX`

Examples:

*Checking of a contact in the contacts page:* +
*Step 1:* Type `check 1` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it

[[UG-CheckExample1]]
image::UG-CheckExample1.png[width="400"]

*Step 2:* The result box will display "Contact Shown"

[[UG-CheckExample2]]

able to see the claims that belong to this contact
[[UG-CheckExample3]]
image::UG-CheckExample3.png[width="400"]


*Checking of a claim in the claims page:* +
*Step 1:* Type `check 2` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. This index 2 represents the claimID
of each individual claim card.

=== Making a mistake : `<any invalid entry>`

Prompts user on whether he or she would want to create a shortcut as FinSec does not recognise the command.

If the user wishes to create a shortcut with this entry, he would then proceed to type in which commands he would want
to create the shortcut for.

If the user does not want to create a shortcut and it is just a typo error, he can enter `"n"` to continue with his
commands.

Example:

* `AC` (FinSec does not recognise the command)
* `add_contact` (User chooses to create the shortcut for the command `add_contact`)
* The shortcut `AC` is created for the command `add_contact`

****
* Creates an alternative keyword for the command `add_contact`
* Now `AC` can be used as a replacement to add a contact
