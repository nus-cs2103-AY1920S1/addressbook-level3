    "description": "This module will examine the Biblical, Confucian, Socratic, and Modern or Machiavellian conceptions of the virtuous leader. The module is aimed at exposing students to the most representative texts of each tradition in order to gain depth of understanding of the competing conceptions of leadership, and their underlying assumptions about the nature of human beings. Students will also be expected to interrogate each tradition with a view to discovering its relevance to contemporary life.",
