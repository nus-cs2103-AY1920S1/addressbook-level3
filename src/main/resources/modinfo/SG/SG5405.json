    "description": "The projects provide students with the opportunity to practice their newly acquired skills as part of a team working on a large-scale real-life IT project as a software architect. The projects would usually take the form of a design and consulting engagement for a sponsoring organisation (typically the employer of the candidate). These projects will enable students to apply the tools, techniques and methods they have learned, and also allow sponsoring organisations to experience and assess new technologies, techniques and methods. ISS instructors and supervisors from external organizations will be involved to assess the student deliverables.",
