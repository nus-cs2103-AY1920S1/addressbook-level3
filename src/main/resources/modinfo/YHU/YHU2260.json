    "description": "This course introduces students to the work of Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. It will involve close and systematic readings of a selection of their main texts, which are widely regarded as some of the most influential works to emerge from France. It will also seek to locate the distinctive approach of both Derrida and Deleuze respectively with respect to the way that their work has been taken up and used more broadly, and to address disputes about the meaning and adequacy of their views.",
