    "description": "This module is designed to help students achieve better self-awareness through the understanding of basic psychological concepts such as self-esteem, social comparison, self-perception and self-handicapping. Students learn about how they acquire knowledge about themselves, how low self-esteem came about, and what psychologists learned about happiness. The module consists of two lectures and two tutorials. After each lecture, students will meet in small groups to share their own experience in relation to the concepts covered during lecture. By responding to a set of questionnaires, students will also have the opportunity during small group discussion to achieve a better understanding of themselves.",
