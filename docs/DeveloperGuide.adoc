=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

Refer to <<Design-Logic, 2.3 Logic Component>> to view the Class Diagram of the Logic Component.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ABCBookParser` class to parse the user command, depending on the current mode of the App.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a note).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteNoteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the CardBook, FileBook, PasswordBook and NoteBook data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>`, `ObservableList<File>`,`ObservableList<Password>` and `ObservableList<Note>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SecureIT data in json format and read it back, including Password Book, File Book, Note Book and Card Book.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


=== Password Management
==== Model
The `Password` model is created to support the password management feature of our application.
It stores the information of all the passwords created by the user. The class diagram of the `Password` model is as follows:

image::PasswordClassDiagram.png[]

The `Password` model consists of a `Password` class which has its attributes implemented as
separate classes to follow *Single Responsibility Principle*. The attributes are as follows:

`Username`: The username of the password model

`PasswordValue`: The actual password value of the password model

`PasswordDescription`: The description of the password model.

`Website`: The website where the password is being used for.

`PasswordModifiedAt`: The local date when the password is last modified.

`PasswordExpiredAt`: The local date 1 year after the password is last modified.

`ExpiryMode`: It has 3 modes: `HEALTHY`, `EXPIRING`, `EXPIRED`, depending on how close local time is when compared to the expiry date of the password.

The `Password` are stored in a `UniquePasswordList` in the `PasswordBook` and the existing model manager is extended to
add the functionality managing passwords into the application. Minimal functionality are added to adhere to the *YAGNI* principle.

==== Design Considerations:
===== Aspect: Model Manager for Password.
This would be similar for all other models including `File` model, `Card` model, `Note` model and `Password` model.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The current model manager is extended to handle the filtered lists of all the models.
** Pros: Adheres to *DRY* design principle as it extends the functionality of the model manager without repeating.
** Cons: It might increase coupling in the model manager.

* **Alternative 2:** Create another `Model` interface and another `Model Manager` class.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Does not adhere to *DRY* design principle, where additional `Model Manager` class are created.

==== Logic
In this feature, you are able to `add`, `read`, `edit`, `find`, `list`, `delete` and `copy`. Additional `Parser` and `Command`
classes are included to enhance the functionality. The class diagram for all `Command` classes available for `Password` model is as follows:

image::CopyCommand.png[]


===== Aspect: Logic Manager for Password model.
This would be similar for all other models such as the `File` model, `Card` model, `Note` model and `Password` model.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The current logic manager is extended to handle the model parsers. The logic manager
checks for the current mode of the system and decides which model parser class to use.
** Pros: This adheres to the Open-closed principle in SOLID. Same command words can be used in different modes and it does not increase coupling in the application.
** Cons: Hard to implement. Requires another command to switch modes. Similar command classes will need to be implemented in different model such as `AddPasswordCommand`, `AddNoteCommand`, `AddCardCommand`.
However, all the fields in the command classes are different and separating them into different classes reduces coupling.
* **Alternative 2:** Extending one parser class to handle all the different commands. Different command will have different `add` command words.

** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: User will have to remember different command words for the same `add` command for different modes. This will decrease the usability of the application.

==== Copy Command:
===== Current Implementation:
`CopyPasswordValueCommand` class, `CopyWebsiteCommand` class and `CopyUsernameCommand` class extends `CopyPasswordCommand` class.

These three classes are implemented together with `CopyCommandParser` class to create the functionality of copying the required details onto clipboard using CLI.
Since this is a command that would be used frequently, command alias are added to increase the efficiency for the user.
The activity diagram below describes the flow of the `CopyPasswordCommand`:

image::CopyPasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram describes the detailed interactions between any `CopyPasswordCommand` and the architecture:

==== Design Considerations:
===== Aspect: Implementation of `CopyPasswordCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `CopyPasswordCommand` class extends `Command` class. `CopyPasswordValueCommand` class, `CopyWebsiteCommand` class and `CopyUsernameCommand` class extend `CopyPasswordCommand`.
** Pros: This follows closely to *Polymorphism* and *Inheritance* concepts as all three commands share the similar functionality.
The common functionality is abstracted out and placed inside the `CopyPasswordCommand`.
** Cons: Any further enhancement of the child commands will have to follow `Liskov Substitution Principle` and it needs to be more restrictive than the parent command.

* **Alternative 2:** `CopyPasswordValueCommand`, `CopyWebsiteCommand` , `CopyUsernameCommand` will extend `Command` class.
** Pros: Easy to implement. `PasswordBookParser` can directly check for the command word instead of splitting into 2 command words.
** Cons: Violates *DRY* design principle.

// tag::generate[]

=== Generate Password

This section provides implementation details on the password generation feature.

==== Overview
The purpose of password generation is to provide users with a hassle-free way to generate random, secure passwords.

By default, the password generation feature will generate a random password that:

* is 10 letters long

* includes lower case alphabets

* includes upper case alphabets

* includes numerals

* includes Special characters

However, users can alternatively choose to customise any of the aforementioned fields as per their needs through their input.

The generation of truly random passwords is made possible through the use of the `java.security.SecureRandom` API.
It provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) that will be used in the password generation.

The intricacies will be further reviewed in the **Implementation** section below.

==== Implementation

The following activity diagram summarises the general steps taken during password generation:


.Summary flow of actions during password generation.
image::GeneratePasswordActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

The steps below outline explicity the generation of passwords :

*  The user input is `#parse()` by the `GeneratePasswordCommandParser`.

* Based on the user input, a `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` is instantiated.
** If the user input includes optional prefixes to customise configuration, we modify the attributes of the `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` through various setter methods.

** Else, the default `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` instantiated through the static method `GeneratePasswordDescriptor#getDefaultConfiguration()`.


[NOTE]
The `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` is an object that encapsulates the settings of the **configuration** used for password generation.

* Upon `GeneratePasswordCommand` is instantiated with the given configuration.

* Upon `#execute()`, the static method `GeneratorUtil#generateRandomPassword()` is invoked:

** Based on the configuration, the relevant character sets (lower-case alphabets, upper case alphabets, numerals, special characters) are added into a list.

** The `GeneratorUtil` class uses the method `java.security.SecureRandom.nextInt()` to choose a random characters set, followed by a random character within the set to be used in the new password.

** This process of choosing a character to include in the password is repeated for the length of the password.

* The generated password is then checked to see if it includes all the user requirements (ie. whether it includes all the character sets specified by the user.)

* This process of generating a password is repeated until the user requirements are met.

The activity diagram below depicts the way in which a password is generated by the method `GeneratorUtil#generateRandomPassword()`:

.Summary flow of actions during the invokation of #generateRandomassword().
image::GenerateMethodActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Design considerations

These are the considerations we came across when implementing the generate feature:

===== Aspect: How to generate a random password
|===
|**Alternative 1 (Current choice)**|**Alternative 2**
How to generate a truly random password
| **Randomly choose a character set, followed by a character within the set to include in password**: +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Randomness is achieved because there is no predictability in the way a character set, or character is chosen.


[underline]_Cons:_ +
Efficiency is compromised. Generating a password this way may produce a password that does not meet user configuration
(e.g. random password does not include special characters, although it was supposed to).
As such, program needs to keep producing new random password until all the user configuration are met.
|**Ensuring all user configurations are met by hard coding a pattern in the way character sets are included** +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Efficiency is achieved. We are guaranteed to generate a password that matches users' configuration everytime (e.g. lower case -> upper case -> numeral -> special case patter) +

[underline]_Cons:_ +
Randomness is compromised. Generating passwords in such a pattern makes the password style very predictable, hence compromising randomness and security.

2+|**Why did we choose Alternative 1:** +
Although less time efficient, the password generated is more random, and thus more secure. Generating a secure password is inline with our use case, and so is a more important factor.

// end::generate[]

// tag::analyse[]

=== Analyse Password

This section provides implementation details on the analyse password feature.

==== Overview

The purpose of analysing passwords is to provide users with information on the level of security of their passwords.

The user can either :

1. View a summary table of results of all password by inputting `"analyse"` OR

2. View a detailed review of a specific password by inputting `"analyse strong/INDEX"`

SecureIT analyses 6 core components of every `Password`, using various `Analysers`. The following table summarises the functionality of each `Analyser`:

|===
||**Purpose / Checks for**
|**UniqueAnalyser **: +
| Checks that every password is unique.
|**StrengthAnalyser **: +
| Checks the complexity of every password.
|**SimilarityAnalyser **: +
| Checks that no two accounts share a password that is at least 70% similar.

|**DictionaryAnalyser **: +
| Checks that password does not contain any commonly-used passwords. (e.g. "password")

|**SequenceAnalyser **: +
| Checks that password does not contain any commonly-used sequences. (e.g. "ABC")
|**KeyboardAnalyser **: +
| Checks that password does not contain any commonly-used keyboard patterns. (e.g. "qwerty")

|===

The following class diagram is the current structure of the `Analyser` component.

.Class diagram depicting the structure of the Analyser component.
image::AnalyserClassDiagram.png[]

In summary,

1. The analysis of passwords is initiated upon `#execute()` of the `AnalysePasswordCommand`.

2. Each `Analyser` analyses every password in the password book.

3. The analysis of each password produces the respective `Result` for that password.

4. These `Results` are compiled and written into a `AnalysisReport`, which is then shown to the user in the form of a summary table.

5. Users can opt to view a detailed report for a specific password to get more information on the respective `Result`.


==== Implementation

On `#execute()`, AnalysePasswordCommand retrieves the current list of passwords via `Model#getFilteredPasswordList()`.
It also retrieves the required analysers via `#getRequiredAnalysers()`.

Each `Analyser` has it's own implementation of `#analyse()`, which will subsequently be invoked by the `AnalysePasswordCommand` given the current list of passwords.

The following sequence diagram breaks down the general flows of events stated above, and in the context of a `DictionaryAnalyser`:

[NOTE]
The other `Analysers` are instantiated in a similar fashion in `#getRequiredAnalsyers()` and hence omitted to the make the diagram less congested.

.Sequence diagram depicting the flow of analysing the list of passwords, in the context of DictionaryAnalyser.
image::AnalysePasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

In the following discussion, we will be reviewing how `Results` are produced for each password, in the context of the `DictionaryAnalyser`.

In the case of the `DictionaryAnalyser#analyse()`, every password is checked to see if it contains any subsequence that is listed as a commonly used password in the instantiated `Dictionary`. This is done in the internal method `#getAllMatches(password)` within `#analyse()`.

[NOTE]
The `Dictionary` is an object that maps commonly used passwords to their ranking in terms of how commonly used they are. (e.g. "123456" is mapped to rank 1 in the Dictionary because it is  the most commonly used password)

If there exists a subsequence that tests positive when looked up against the `Dictionary` , a `DictionaryMatch` is created to note down the details of the subsequence.

[NOTE]
A `Match` is an object that is created to encapsulate the details of any matches found when analysing a given password. Each `Analyser` will create it's respective `Match` when needed.

Thus, we see that the method `#getAllMatches(password)` will return a list of all `DictionaryMatch` found for a given password.

As long as a `DictionaryMatch` is found, then the password has failed the analysis. A `DictionaryResult` with the attribute `ResultOutcome.FAIL` will be created for that password. This process is repeated for every password. Following, the list of `DictionaryResult` are returned to be compiled and written by the `AnalysisReport`.

The following sequence diagram depicts the flow of events mentioned above:

.Sequence diagram depicting the flow of getting all Match objects for a given password.
image::GetAllMatchesSequence.png[width="500"]

It is also worth mentioning that `DictionaryAnalyser` is capable of identifying commonly used passwords even in leet-ed variations (e.g. p@5sw0rd).

This is made possible because of the method `#LeetUtil.translateLeet()`, which is a recursive algorithm designed to return all possible un-leet variations, given a leet-ed password. The details of the algorithm can be found here:

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How analyse/analyse strong executes
|===
|**Alternative 1 (Current choice)**|**Alternative 2**

| **Always analyse the entire list of Password objects for every "analyse" command,
even if the list of Passwords was unchanged.** +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Easy to implement, not required to check state if the current list of Passwords has been modified.
 +

[underline]_Cons:_ +
May have performance issues in terms of speed of the programme.
|**Save in memory the result produced by the Analyser objects, and update result upon modification of
list of Passwords (e.g. new passwords added/ passwords deleted.)** +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Performance of programme will be a lot faster and efficient. +

[underline]_Cons:_ +
Hard to implement. Have to keep track of state of the list of Password objects and check if the list has been modified
from the last time they were analysed.

2+|**Why did we choose Alternative 1:** +
From a more practical point of view, users are not expected to constantly want to keep analysing their passwords, so it may be a waste of memory to constantly save the results, as per Alternative 2.

Also, considering the fact that each password is capped at a length of 25, time performance will not be affected significantly when analysing each password.


|===

// end::analyse[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== General Data Encryption

==== Initialization and Validation

We encrypt all the data files of SecureIT with a master password set by the user. The initialization and validation of the master password are handled by `*TestStorage*`.

The following diagram shows how the master password is initialized when the user uses the app for the first time and validated for subsequent uses of the app.

image::InitPasswordActivityDiagram.png[]

Note that to protect users' data, the main components of the app (`*Storage*`, `*Ui*`, `*Logic*`, `*Model*`) can only be initialised with a correct master password.

Also, the app does not store the master password itself. Instead, during initialization, the app encrypts a magic word using the password and stores it in the file system. For validation, the app tries to decrypt the stored magic word using the password given and checks if the original word is obtained. If the password given is correct, the original magic word should be obtained.

==== Encryption Method

The following sequence diagram explains how the `*EncryptionUtil*` class encrypts an input byte array using a password.

image::EncryptionUtilSequenceDiagram.png[]

The process of encrypting a byte array is outlined as follows:

Step 1. A key (`*SecretKey key*`) is generated from the password string (`*pwd*`) and a specified encryption method (`*PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES*`) via a utility class (`*SecretKeyFactory*`).

Step 2. A set of parameter specification (`*PBEParameterSpec paramSpec*`) is generated with hardcoded parameters (`*SALT*`, `*ITERATION*`). Hardcoded parameters ensure that the same password can always be correctly validated at different times.

Step 3. A `*Cipher*` class is constructed with the same encryption method specified above (`*PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES*`) and initialised with the key and the set of parameter specifications.

Step 4. The `*doFinal*` method conducts the actual encryption on the input array and returns the encrypted byte array.

The decryption process is similar to the encryption process, except that the `*ENCRYPT_MODE*` is changed to `*DECRYPT_MODE*`. The same password is necessary to decrypt an encrypted byte array to its original content.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::fileencryption[]
=== File Management
SecureIT does not store users' encrypted files directly. Instead, it reads the files' data, carries out the encryption, and replaces the original files with encrypted ones in users' file system. Meanwhile, it also maintains records of files that it encrypts, represented by `*EncryptedFile*` class, in an internal data structure, `*FileBook*`.

The following diagram illustrates how the record of an encrypted file is represented internally.

image::FileModelClassDiagram.png[Diagram, 700]

The `*FileBook*`, managed by the app's `*ModelManager*`, keeps a `*UniqueFileList*`. The list encapsulates an internal mechanism to prevent file duplication. Each entry in the list represents a record of an encrypted file.

An `*EncryptedFile*` must have the following attributes:  a `*FileName*`, a `*FilePath*`, and a `*FileStatus*`. While the first two attributes allow the app to locate the file, the file status provides users with an indication of the current state of the file. It defaults to `*ACTIVE*` for newly encrypted/added files.

Two timestamps, `*EncryptedAt*` and `*ModifiedAt*`, provide users with more details about the file. These two attributes may not always be available. For example, encrypted files added with `add` command do not contain this information.

Lastly, while a `*ViewableFile*` contains the file's content for preview. It is a generic class which is extendable to accommodate even more file types in future. The `*FilePreviewPanel*`, which is a `*UI*` component, depends on `*ViewableFile*` to render the preview.

==== Logic

The user can perform the following operations: `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `add`, `remove`, `move`, `rename`, and `preview`. There are two differences between the commands of the file manager and those of the address book. First, some file commands require a password for execution. Second, most file commands involve interaction with the external file system.

The solution to the first difference is a `*FileCommandParser*` class which is similar to the `*Parser*` class, but it packages the password within the commands during parsing. It is illustrated in the class diagram below:

image::FileCommandParserClassDiagram.png[]

To address the second difference, we separate the access to the file system from the parser. For example, during encryption, at the parsing stage, an `*EncryptedFile toAdd*` is created without the knowledge of the actual file. Both the validation and encryption are carried out only at the execution stage. This is illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

image::EncryptSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Below is a summary of my considerations and analysis while developing the file manager:

. When to do file validation with the file system
+
*Alternative 1*: When a command is parsed +
*Pros*: There is no need to construct `*EncryptedFile*` objects for invalid files. +
*Cons*: Both the command parsing and execution require interaction with the file system. `*Parser*` violates the single responsibility principle.
+
*Alternative 2*: When a command is executed +
*Pros*: Interaction with the file system only occurs during execution. Easier to debug. +
*Cons*: Need to construct `*EncryptedFile*` when file information is not yet available. Cannot initialise `*ModifiedAt*` in the constructor.
+
We choose alternative 2 because according to single responsibility principle, `*Parser*` should only convert user input to correct command format, without the knowledge of files.

. How to implement the file preview feature
+
*Alternative 1*: UI components read file content +
*Pros*: There is no need to create extra classes in `*Model*`, such as `*ViewableFile*`. +
*Cons*: UI components have to interact directly with the file system.
+
*Alternative 2*: Read file content during command execution +
*Pros*: File system access is limited to command execution time only. +
*Cons*: Need to pass the file content to the UI components via `*CommandResult*`.
+
We choose alternative 2 because it is better to keep all access to file system in one place.

// end::fileencryption[]

=== Notes Feature
==== Open Note

The user is able to open a note in the note book in a separate panel to easily read and edit its contents.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the note is retrieved and edited through the UI via the `open` command.

image::OpenNoteSequenceDiagram.png[]

Below is the sub-diagram for retrieving the note through the `open` command.

image::OpenNoteSequenceDiagramRef.png[]

****
* Note that the sequence diagram for the `edit` command is similar to the `open` command shown above, hence is omitted.
****

Given below is an example usage of scenario of the `open` command in notes, where a user intends to open a note to read
or edit its contents.

*Step 1.* Through the `goto note` command, the user arrives at the notes component of the app. The user then executes the command
`open 1`.

*Step 2.* The app recognises that it is an `open` command and proceeds to check if the index `1` given is a valid index using
the `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` method.

*Step 3.* If the index given by the user is valid, the corresponding note will be retrieved. This note is shown to the user in a panel on the right
within the app.

*Step 4.* The user proceeds to edit the `Title`, `Description` and `Content` field of the note through this panel and saves his
edits using the save button. This executes the `Logic#EditNoteCommand()` which edits the note in the note book.

*Step 5.* The note book is now updated with the note edited by the user.


==== Undo/Redo
===== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the VersionedNoteBook, which extends NoteBook with a undo/redo history.
This history is stored in two stacks - the undo stack and the redo stack. The undo stack stores the states of NoteBooks
before the current state and the redo stack which stores the states of NoteBooks after the current state.
The key operations that support this mechanisms are:

`VersionedNoteBook#commit()` — Saves the current NoteBook state and its corresponding command in the undo stack.

`VersionedNoteBook#undo()` — Restores the previous note book state from the undo stack and returns its corresponding command
to inform the user what command is undone. It also stores the current state of the note book into the redo stack.

`VersionedNoteBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone note book state from the redo stack and returns its corresponding
command to inform the user what command is redone. It also stores the current state of the note book into the undo stack.

Below is a comprehensive activity diagram to illustrate how the undo & redo mechanism works.

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

Not all commands are undo-able. Undo-able commands are those that modifies the note book which includes: `add`, `delete`,
`clear`, `edit` and `open`.

====
* The `open` command is considered undo-able because it updates the number of access
to the note that is opened.
====

Below is an example run through of how the undo command is executed:

. User executes `undo` command which calls the `VersionedNoteBook#undo()`.
. This method call first checks if the undo stack is empty.
.. The undo stack will be empty if no undo-able command were called prior
to calling the `undo` command.
.. The undo mechanism will only proceed only if the undo stack is not empty,
else an `InvalidUndoException` will be thrown.
. The current state of the note book is then checked against the previous state of the note book.
.. In the event that they are the same, the
previous note book state is popped from the undo stack and the `undo` command is called recursively (starting from step 2).
This recursive call is performed until either the current and previous note book state are different or until the undo stack is empty.
.. In the event that they are different, proceed on to step 4.

. The current state of the note book is first stored in the redo stack.
. The note book is then reverted to the previous note book state. This same previous note book state is removed from
the undo stack.
. Undo command is complete.

====
* Step 3 is to prevent users from being able to perform `undo` actions when there is no change to be undone.
====


===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the entire note book.
** Pros: Less complex and easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* Alternative 2: Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Makes use of lesser memory.
** Cons: More complex to implement and more prone to bugs as each individual command must be correct to work correctly.

*The reason why we chose alternative 1:*
By adopting a simpler implementation, we aim to introduce less bugs into system. Furthermore, this implementation better
supports future extensions as undoable commands can be added much easier.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use two stacks to store the history of note book states - one for undo, one for redo.
** Pros: Very easy to implement.
** Cons: Using two data structures may incur additional overhead in terms of memory.

* Alternative 2: Use a single linked list to store the history of note book states which supports both undo and redo.
** Pros: May incur less overhead in terms of memory usage as only one data structure is used.
** Cons: More complex to implement.

*The reason why we chose alternative 1:*
It is less complex to implement and the code is much cleaner for better readability which also helps in future extensions.

==== Sort Note feature

Sorting of notes is handled by the MultipleSortByCond class, which allows the notes in the NoteBook to be sorted in
three different ways - by date modified, date added or number of access.

Below is a
class diagram to illustrate how the NoteBook class and MultipleSortByCond class interact with one another.

image::SortNoteClassDiagram.png[]

Sorting the note book rearranges the notes according to the sort conditions provided.

More than one of the conditions can be used to sort the notes in the note book at one time, with the first condition
having the greatest precedence.

Example: `sort by/NumOfAccess DateAdded`

* NumOfAccess and DateAdded are the sort conditions, with NumOfAccess having greater precedence over DateAdded.

This is handled by the `MultipleSortByCond#buildComparator()`, which takes in the sort conditions specified by the user and returns a `MultipleCondNoteComparator` object that is used to sort the list of notes
in NoteBook.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a significant number of confidential documents to keep track of


* prefers localised storage for confidential documents to online or third party vault for storing personal information and passwords


* can type fast


* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps


*Value proposition*: Remember only one password, and save the hassle of remembering all other confidential documents (account details, credit card details, secret files, secret notes). Have a safe and secure way to store all confidential documents locally, without the use of the online/ third party / cloud-reliant vaults.
