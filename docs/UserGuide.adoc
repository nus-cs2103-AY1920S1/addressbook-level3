== Introduction

IchiFund is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing finance*. More importantly, IchiFund is
*optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IchiFund can get your finance management tasks done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ichifund.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your IchiFund.
.  Double-click the file to start IchiFund. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
* Alternatively, open a command window and run `java -jar ichifund.jar` in the appropriate directory.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
E.g., typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
Here are some example commands you can try in the transaction tab:

* `add de/Lunch a/12.30` : adds an expenditure item for "Lunch" to IchiFund.
* `filter m/10 y/2019 c/!all ty/exp` : finds all expenditure items from October 2019.
* `exit` : exits IchiFund

.  Refer to <<Navigation>> for details on how to navigate through IchiFund.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Navigation]]
== Navigation
IchiFund has five features: Transactions, Repeaters, Budgets, Loans and Analytics.
Each feature is allocated to its own tab, and the commands for each feature only work when you are
using the tab associated to the feature.

When you enter a command that is not used by the feature, the following message is shown:

image::InapplicableCommand.png[]

In this case, `expenditure`, a command for "Analytics", is not recognised as the application is currently
in the "Transactions" tab.

=== Switching tabs

We offer three modes for you to switch tabs:

. Clicking on the tab
. Using a shortcut key
. Entering a global command

The global commands and shortcut keys are summarized in the table below:

|==============================
| Feature | Command | Shortcut Key

| Transactions | `tx` | `Ctrl + 1`
| Repeaters | `rep` | `Ctrl + 2`
| Budgets | `budget` | `Ctrl + 3`
| Loans | `loan` | `Ctrl + 4`
| Analytics | `analytics` | `Ctrl + 5`
|==============================

To use the global command, simply enter the command as you would for any other
command, and the application automatically switches to the appropriate tab.
These commands are recognised regardless of which tab you are currently using.

[[Features]]

// tag::tx[]
=== Transactions

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of transactions you have to keep track of?
With our transactions feature, you can organise your transactions in a fuss-free manner!

//tag::overviewtx[]
[[overviewtx]]
==== Overview

In the transactions tab, you can maintain a list of your transactions, adding, editing, deleting and filtering items
as you like. The image below gives an overview of the GUI of the feature:

[[transactionsScreenshot]]
.Transaction tab
image::TransactionsScreenshot.png[]

Before we introduce the commands you can use, let us briefly run through the labelled components of our GUI.

===== Transaction list / cell
The transaction list comprises several transaction cells. Each transaction cell represents a single transaction.
We give a further breakdown of the information each transaction cell displays in the following image:

[[transactionCell]]
.Information in a transaction cell
image::TransactionCell.png[]

[NOTE]
We differentiate income items from expenditure items using the color of the text for the "Amount" field. A green
amount indicates that the transaction is an income item; a red amount indicates that the transaction is an
expenditure item. For example, the first transaction cell in <<transactionsScreenshot>> represents an income item,
whereas the second cell represents an expenditure item.


===== Filter title
The filter title indicates which transactions are being shown. In <<transactionsScreenshot>>, the list
shows only transactions that occur on October 2019, under the category "Food".

Minimally, the filter title contains the month and year of the filter applied. It can also display
the category shown, as well as whether only expenditure/income items are shown.

The filter title changes along with the filter that is applied to the list. You can change the filter using
the `filter` command in <<filtertx>>

[NOTE]
On startup, the filter is generated based on the latest transaction you have recorded,
up to the current date. The filter follows the month and year of this transaction, and does not
filter for category or type.
If there are no transactions recorded, the current date in the system is used to
generate the the filter.
This makes it easier for you to access the transactions in the current month!

// end::overviewtx[]

// tag::filtertx[]
[[filtertx]]
==== Filtering transaction: `filter`
Format: `filter [m/MONTH] [y/YEAR] [c/CATEGORY] [ty/TYPE]`

To better understand how your money goes down the drain, it is critical to organise and filter your
transactions. `filter` does the job for you.

Let's say you are currently viewing transactions from
September 2018. The GUI of Ichifund may look like this:

image::filtertx1.png[]

Suppose you want to view transactions from a different month, say, September 2018.
You can simply enter the command `filter m/9 y/2018`, which results in the following view:

image::filtertx2.png[]


Now, if you want to only see expenditure items, simply enter the command `filter ty/exp`.

image::filtertx3.png[]

You may find that this view of the list is still too cluttered for you. In that case,
you can further limit the transactions in the list to contain only items from the category "FOOD" using
the command `filter c/food`

image::filtertx4.png[]

If you want to see expenditure items of the same time, but in a different month, say, August 2019, enter
the command `filter m/8`. Note that you do not need to enter the year, category, or transaction type again.
The GUI will update accordingly, as follows:

image::filtertx5.png[]

[NOTE]
Categories are case-insensitive, and can contain up to 50 alphanumerical characters, including spaces.

[TIP]
To see only expenditure items, enter `filter ty/exp`; to see only income items, enter `filter ty/in`. This
also applies when you are adding transactions in <<addtx>>

===== Removing category and transaction type filter
Now, if you want to remove both the category filter and the transaction type, you can enter the command
`filter c/!all ty/!all`.

image::filtertx6.png[]

[NOTE]
You can only remove the category and transaction type filter using the `!all` argument. We do not support
the removal of the month and year filter.

[TIP]
Like the other commands in IchiFund, you can enter the arguments in any order, as long as
the command word `filter` is keyed in at the start.

// end::filtertx[]

// tag::addtx[]
[[addtx]]
==== Creating transaction: `add`
Format: `add de/DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT [c/CATEGORY] [d/DAY] [m/MONTH] [y/YEAR] [ty/TRANSACTION_TYPE]`

As painful as it is to remind yourself each time you part with your money, it is essential to meticulously
record your transactions. `add` eases this process.

Imagine you are browsing your transactions under the category of "Transportation"
in November. Your GUI may look like this:

image::addtx1.png[width=960]

Let's say you remember that spent $12.31 on lunch on 31 October 2019.
If you want to record this transaction under the category "FOOD", you can enter the full
command `add de/Lunch a/12.31 c/food d/31 m/10 y/2019 ty/exp`

The application now looks like this:

image::addtx2.png[]

Here, IchiFund automatically changes the filter for you, so that you can review the addition
you made. This makes it convenient if you want to edit your transactions, as detailed in <<edittx>>

Also, note that the transaction appears at the top of the list. This is because we automatically sort
your transactions by date, followed by category, so that you can systematically look through your
transactions.

[NOTE]
When specifying whether a transaction is an expenditure item or an income item, use the arguments
`ty/exp` or `ty/in` respectively, similar to how would do so in <<filtertx>>

===== Optional arguments

You may find the command used earlier too cumbersome to type. If so, you can leave out some of the optional
arguments. To illustrate this, let's return to the earlier scenario:

image::addtx1.png[]

Let's say it is 1 November 2019 today. You have just spent another $10.00 hiring a cab to go to the hospital,
and want to record this transaction under the category of "Transportation". You can simply enter
the command `add a/10 de/Cab to hospital`, and obtain the following result:

image::addtx3.png[]

Here, as the month, year, and category arguments are left empty, IchiFund fills it in according to the
filter title. The day argument is taken to be the current day of the month, according to the system date.
IchiFund also assumes that most transactions are expenditure items, and uses that as a default value.

The following table summarizes the default values that optional arguments take if left unspecified.

|==============================
| Argument | Default values

| Day | According to system time and date.
| Month | According to the filter
| Year | According to the filter
| Category | According to the filter, if applicable, or "Uncategorised" otherwise.
| Type | According to the filter, if applicable, or "exp" otherwise.
|==============================

[TIP]
The default value of the day argument is the current day of month in the system time. Hence, to utilise this
feature to its fullest, you are recommended to add transactions on the day it occurs.

===== Constraints
The feature for adding transactions is built to work best under these constraints:

|==============================
| Argument | Constraints

| Description | Up to 50 alphanumeric characters with spaces; case-sensitive
| Amount | Positive number with up to 2 decimal places; maximum value of $99999.99 for each transaction
| Category | Up to 50 alphanumeric characters with spaces; case-insensitive
| Day | Whole number from 1-31
| Month | Whole number from 1-12
| Year | Whole number from 2000-9999
| Type | Either "in" or "exp"
|==============================

Additionally, the transaction feature works best when the system time functions normally, with no change in time zone.

// end::addtx[]

[[edittx]]
==== Editing transaction: `edit`
Format: `edit INDEX [de/DESCRIPTION] [a/AMOUNT] [c/CATEGORY] [d/DAY] [m/MONTH] [y/YEAR] [ty/TRANSACTION_TYPE]`

Occasionally, you may make a mistake entering your transactions. Perhaps you keyed in the wrong amount, or made
a heinous spelling error in your description. Fret not! You can correct these mistakes using `edit`, and it would
be as if it never happened.

Suppose you wanted to record your cab fare to the hospital, and you mistakenly record the amount you spent as
$10.00 instead of $20.00:

image::addtx3.png[]

You can rectify this error simply by entering the command `edit 2 a/20.00`:

image::edittx.png[]

Here, the number "2" specified near the start of the command corresponds to the index of the transaction
you want to edit, as shown in the current transaction list.
Apart from that, you need to specify only the information you want to edit.

In addition, to make it easier for you to review your edits,
the filter of the transaction list changes accordingly such that the edited transaction is shown.

[NOTE]
Unfortunately, transactions created from repeaters cannot be edited or deleted directly.
For a more detailed guide on how to modify these transactions, refer to <<repeaters>>

[NOTE]
The constraints in <<addtx>> apply to this command as well.

[[deletetx]]
==== Deleting transaction: `delete`
Format: `delete INDEX`

By a stroke of luck, you may sometimes get a reimbursement for your expenditure! While you celebrate the
influx of precious money, do take a moment to update IchiFund using `delete`.

Let's say you have just recorded and edited your cab ride to the hospital:

image::addtx3.png[]

Suppose you now find out that the expenditure is somehow covered by your insurance plan.
Simply enter the command `delete 2`:

image::deletetx.png[]

Voila! The transaction is now deleted.

Again, you only have to specify the index of the transaction you want to delete, as shown in the current
transaction list.

[NOTE]
Unfortunately, transactions created from repeaters cannot be edited or deleted directly.
For a more detailed guide on how to modify these transactions, refer to <<repeaters>>

// end::tx[]

==== Reducing clutter (coming in v2.0)

Naturally, you may find your transaction list to be flooded with transactions. Beyond the
filtering introduced in <<filtertx>>, we have in store several features to be released in the
next major version of IchiFund.

===== Archiving transactions: `archive`
Format: `archive [INDEX]`

If you want to hide transactions from your view, but do not wish to delete it entirely, you can simply
use the upcoming `archive` command!

Suppose you want to archive the second transaction in the current list. Simply use the command `archive 2`
to send that transaction into the archive.

You can switch between the main and archived transaction lists using the command `archive`.

From the archive, you can unarchive transactions with the same command. To unarchive the third transaction
in the archive list, simply use `archive 3`, and the transaction is transferred to the main transaction list.

===== Finding transactions: `find`
Format: `find [KEYWORDS]...`

If you want to quickly search for a transaction in your transaction list, you can further refine your search
using the upcoming `find` command!

The `find` command takes in keywords as parameters, allowing you to search for transactions containing
specific keywords in their respective descriptions.

For example, `find dinner steak` updates the list to show transactions from the current filter that have the words
"dinner" and "steak" in their descriptions.

==== Setting wealth (coming in v2.0)
Format: `wealth a/AMOUNT`

If you want a quick simple summary of how much money you have left to spend, you can use our upcoming
wealth setting feature, where you can set the amount of money you have. The wealth value is automatically updated
with every change to your transactions list, so you do not have to worry about manually resetting wealth with every
transaction made!

[[repeaters]]
=== Repeaters
There is sometimes a need to add the same transaction over and over again. Such is the case for recurring transactions such as phone bills and salaries. With our repeater feature, you can add these recurring transactions in a hassle free manner.

In the repeater tab, you can maintain a list of your repeaters. Each repeater is associated with a list of transactions, which are managed by the repeater. The image below gives an overview of the GUI of the feature. The associated transactions managed by each repeater are highlighted with the respective colored box.

image::rep.png[]

==== Creating repeater: `add`

Format: `add de/DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT [c/CATEGORY] [ty/TRANSACTION_TYPE] [so/MONTH_START_OFFSET] [eo/MONTH_END_OFFSET] sm/START_MONTH sy/START_YEAR em/END_MONTH ey/END_YEAR`

You can use the `add` command to create a repeater. This also creates the transactions associated with the created repeater.

The optional arguments take the following default values if left unspecified.

|==============================
| Argument | Default values

| Category | "Uncategorised"
| Type | "exp"
| Month Start Offset | "-1" (Offset ignored)
| Month End Offset | "-1" (Offset ignored)
|==============================

Constraints:

* Repeater end must not occur before repeater start.
* Repeater start and end can span at most 60 months (5 years).
* At least one of month start offset or month end offset must not be ignored.

Examples:

* `add de/Phone bills a/42.15 c/Utilities ty/exp so/3 eo/2 sm/1 sy/2019 em/12 ey/2020` +
This creates a repeater titled "Phone bills" as an expenditure for utilities of $42.15 for every third day and second last day of the month, between January 2019 to December 2020. This also creates the transactions associated with the created repeater.

==== Editing repeater `edit`

Format: `edit INDEX [de/DESCRIPTION] [a/AMOUNT] [c/CATEGORY] [ty/TRANSACTION_TYPE] [so/MONTH_START_OFFSET] [eo/MONTH_END_OFFSET] [sm/START_MONTH] [sy/START_YEAR] [em/END_MONTH] [ey/END_YEAR]`

You can use the `edit` command to edit a repeater. This also edits the transactions associated with the edited repeater.

[NOTE]
The repeater fields will only be updated where the arguments are specified.

Constraints:

* Repeater end must not occur before repeater start.
* Repeater start and end can span at most 60 months (5 years).
* At least one of month start offset or month end offset must not be ignored.

Examples:

* `edit 1 a/31.34 c/Food ty/in so/1 eo/-1 sm/1 sy/2019 em/12 ey/2020` +
This edits the first repeater in the current list into a $31.34 expenditure for every first day of the month, between January 2019 and December 2020. This also updates the transactions associated with the edited repeater.

==== Deleting repeater: `delete`

Format: `delete INDEX`

You can use the `delete` command to delete a repeater. This also deletes all transactions associated with the deleted repeater.

Examples:

* `delete 12` +
Deletes the 12th repeater in the current list. This also deletes the transactions associated with the deleted repeater.

==== Finding repeater: `find`

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

You can use the `find` command to find repeaters whose description matches all the (case-insensitive) given keyword(s).

Examples:

* `find phone john` +
This finds all repeaters whose description contains all of the keywords "phone" and "john".

=== Budgets

After taking the effort to record your expenditures, you want to ensure that you are spending within your limit.
This is made simple with the budgeting features in IchiFund.

Each budget that you create will have a description and a maximum expenditure limit.
For advanced users who require finer control in their budgeting, you can also
restrict which expenditures to include in the budget computation.

[NOTE]
In v1.4, all budgets are restricted to monthly budget.

In the budget tab, you can maintain a list of your monthly budgets, adding, deleting and filtering items
as you like. The image below gives an overview of the GUI of the feature:

[[budgetsScreenshot]]
.Budgets tab
image::BudgetsScreenshot.png[]

The budget list comprises several budget cells. Each budget cell represents a single budget.
We give a further breakdown of the information each budget cell displays in the following image:

[[budgetCell]]
.Information in a budget cell
image::BudgetCell.png[]

[NOTE]
The budget bar will turn from green to red when you spend over 80% of the total amount.

==== Creating monthly budget: `add`

Format: `add de/DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT [c/CATEGORY] [m/MONTH y/YEAR]`

You can use the `add` command to create a monthly budget.
Let us walk through the process for creating a budget for tracking your spending on food.

1. Check to make sure you are in the budgets tab. If not, switch to it.

image::addbud1.png[]

[start=2]
2. Type `addbud de/Saving my tummy a/82.69 c/food` into the command bar.
This will create a $82.69 budget named _Saving my tummy_ that tracks this month's expenditures tagged with the _food_ category.

[NOTE]
If the optional arguments `m/MONTH` and `y/YEAR` are not provided, the budget will track the current month.

image::addbud2.png[]

[start=3]
3. Press enter to run the command.
You should see the newly created budget in the budget list.

image::addbud3.png[]

If you want to track all monthly expenditures, simply leave out the `c/CATEGORY` argument.
For instance, the following command creates a $500.00 budget that is applicable to all expenditures:
`add de/General budgeting a/500`.


==== Deleting monthly budget: `delete`

Format: `delete INDEX`

You can use `delete` to delete the budget.
Let us walk through the process of deleting the _Saving my tummy_ budget we created previously.

1. Identify the index of the budget you are deleting. Here, the index is 2.

image::deletebud1.png[]

[start=2]
2. Type `delete 2` into the command bar and press enter.
You should see the _Saving my tummy_ budget disappear from the budget list.

==== Finding monthly budget by keywords: `find`

Format: `find [KEYWORDS]...`

You can use `find` to find budgets with description that matches all the given keywords. To illustrate this, let us suppose you want to find all budgets with the word _saving_ in its description.
To do so, type `find saving` into the command bar and press enter.
You should see the search result in the budget list.

To revert the budget list so that all budgets are listed, simply execute `find` without any argument.
