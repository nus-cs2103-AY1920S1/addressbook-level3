    "description": "The theme of this course is how open innovation and open\nbusiness models can generate competitive strategies for\nboth small and large companies. We look at both the\nstrategy making as well as at the strategy implementation.\nThe course draws on recent research and thinking in\n(open) innovation management and books/materials by\nleading experts. The course will help students to integrate\ntheir knowledge about strategic management,\nentrepreneurship, and innovation management and it\nprovides new ways of thinking that will lead to the creation\nof highly differentiated strategies and business models.\nMore specifically, the course focuses on open innovation\nto particular cases in large companies, the strength and\nweaknesses of open innovation strategies, and the\norganization and implementation of open innovation\npractices.\nThe course also extends beyond open innovation and\nexplores more complex systems such as innovation\necosystems where different types of partners are\ncollaborating to jointly establish a new product or solve a\nsocietal problem (e.g. in healthcare or pollution control).\nStudents are requested to apply the knowledge examined\nin the course to new technologies or scientific disciplines.\nIn particular, group assignments are developed in areas\nsuch as healthcare, sustainability and cleantech\ntechnologies, and big data.",
