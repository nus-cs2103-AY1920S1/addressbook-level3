    "description": "Rapid urbanisation has resulted in an increasingly built\nenvironment with new dynamic interactions between the\nnatural (biosphere) and man-made (technosphere). This in\nturn leads to emerging health concerns peculiar to an\nurbanised built environment. Events in the natural\nenvironment continue to be of public health importance,\nespecially climate change as evidenced by extreme\nweather events. In addition, the workplace environment is\nof special concern as most adults spend the greater\nproportion of their waking hours there.\nThis module will introduce students to important issues in\nenvironmental and occupational health and equip them\nwith basic skills in identifying and mitigating environmental\nrisk factors, both in the general and workplace\nenvironment.",
