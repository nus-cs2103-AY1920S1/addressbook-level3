    "description": "Study of biofilms in a variety of natural and engineered systems. The emphasis will be on understanding unique characteristics and on critically evaluating old and new biofilm literature. We will formulate and test working hypotheses regarding development of biofilms, spatial structure ('architecture'), existence of steady states, and the determining factors for biofilm function as well as adhesion and detachment. Specific examples include quantitative characterization of processes occurring in biofilm reactors for the treatment of water and wastewater.",
