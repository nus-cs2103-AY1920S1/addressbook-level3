* This is T.A.rence, a class management system for NUS Teaching Assistants. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* T.A.rence allows NUS Teaching Assistants to organize their various classes and manage each student's information.
* This application is optimized for those who prefer using the Command Line interface.
