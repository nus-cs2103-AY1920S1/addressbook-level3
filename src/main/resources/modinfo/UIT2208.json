    "description": "The 4th industrial revolution, combining notions from fields such as cybernetics, the maker world and artificial intelligence, is rapidly starting to take shape. The key\nunderlying human thought process is often represented by the term  \u2018computational thinking\u2019 but this thought process is much more than thinking like a programmer or computer-like. It is a broadly interdisciplinary process\nencompassing both the arts and the sciences, and essential for succeeding in an interconnected and data driven world. Indeed, thinking computationally is often\nmore like art than like math. This module, explores the thought processes behind computational thinking and considers applications in finance.",
