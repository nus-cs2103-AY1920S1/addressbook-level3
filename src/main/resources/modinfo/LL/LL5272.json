    "description": "In the wake of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, the visibility of finance and financial regulation has increased dramatically. This subject will provide an overview of the global financial system and international efforts to build structures to support its proper functioning. Taking an integrative approach, the subject will look at the evolution of the global financial system, its structure and regulation. In doing so, the subject will analyse financial crises, especially the GFC, and responses thereto, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The approach will be international and comparative, with a focus on major jurisdictions in the global financial system, and will not focus on any single jurisdiction.",
