== Introduction
Welcome to ORGANice! ORGANice is an organ transplant manager desktop application
specifically designed for hospital administration staff who prefer typing.

=== Purpose
This guide documents the software design and considerations
made during the development of ORGANice.

=== Intended audience
This guide is meant for developers who would like to further develop ORGANice.

== Setting up

To set up the developer tools needed to develop ORGANice, refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section provides a high-level overview of ORGANice's codebase.
It is divided into 6 subsections:

* Architecture
* UI component
* Logic component
* Model component
* Storage component
* Common classes

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The Architecture section is meant to explain the high-level design of ORGANice.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The `main` folder contains two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for performing the following tasks:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. For example,
the `LogsCenter` class is in the `Commons` collection because it is used by many classes
to write log messages to the ORGANice's log file.

The rest of ORGANice consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario when a user
issues the command `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim`.

.Component interactions for `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section explains the design of the UI component. +
Figure 4 below depicts the classes in the UI component and their relationships with one another.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section explains the design of the Logic component. +
Figure 5 below depicts the classes in the Logic component and their relationships with one  another.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit ic/S5678908D n/Mr Lim")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim` Command
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `organice.commons` package.

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how features in ORGANice are implemented.

=== List feature
This section describes how the list feature is implemented.

The list feature is implemented using the `ListCommand(Type type)`. When the list command is executed,
the method `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` takes in a predicate
to decide what type of `Person` to show on the `filteredPersons` list.

Therefore, in addition to the existing `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` predicate, three others predicates are introduced
in the `Model` interface to update the list.
The code snippet below shows what these predicates are:

```
    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS = unused -> true;

    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true if person is a doctor */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DOCTORS = person -> person.getType().isDoctor();

    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true  if person is a donor */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DONORS = person -> person.getType().isDonor();

    /** {@code Predicate} that always evaluate to true if person is a patient */
    Predicate<Person> PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PATIENTS = person -> person.getType().isPatient();

```


The activity diagram below illustrates what happens when a user uses the list command.

.Activity Diagram of a List Command
image::ListActivityDiagram.png[]

When the user enters a list command, the result differs depending on the parameter of the command.
If there is no parameter, ORGANice will simply list all existing doctors, patients and donors on the list.
If there is a parameter, ORGANice will check the `TYPE` input and display the respective list of doctors, patients
or donors that corresponds to the input.

=== Matching feature
This section describes how the matching feature is implemented.

Matching is facilitated by the `MatchCommand` class, which extends the `Command` class.
It implements the `MatchCommand#match(Person donor, Patient patient)` operation, which checks if the given patient and
donor have compatible blood and tissue types. For the context of this application, a patient and donor
pair with compatible blood and tissue types is considered as a potential match.


// TODO: find a way to explain that there are two types of matches
The following operations in `ModelManager` accesses the `match` method:

* `ModelManager#matchDonors(Patient patient)` -- Matches all donors in ORGANice with the specified patient.
For each donor that potentially matches the patient, a `MatchedDonor` object is created to store
the compatibility rate of the donor with the patient.
* `ModelManager#matchPatients()` -- Matches all donors with all patients. For every patient in ORGANice,
a `MatchedPatient` object is created to store the number of donors that are potential matches with that patient.

`MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects are stored in an `ObservableList` called
`listOfMatches`. This `ObservableList` can be accessed by `Logic` and displayed by the `UI`
component.

Each time a user invokes the match feature, the contents of `listOfMatches` are deleted.
New `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects are created and stored in the list again.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the match feature works at each step:

Step 1. The user opens up the application with an existing list of patients and donors.

image::MatchState0.png[]

Step 2. The user types in the command `match ic/all`. Each patient will be matched with
all donors via the `MatchCommand#match` operation. A `MatchedPatient` object is created
for each patient, which stores the patient's attributes and the number of potential donors the patient has.

image::MatchState1.png[]

Step 3. The user types in the command `match ic/**PATIENT NRIC**`, where **PATIENT NRIC** is the NRIC of a patient in
ORGANice.
Existing objects in the `listOfMatches` are removed.
For each potential donor of the specified patient, a `MatchedDonor`object is created,
accompanied with the compatibility rate.

image::MatchState2.png[]


The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the match feature:

.Activity Diagram of the Match Command
image::MatchActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Storage of match results
This section explores several ways of storing match results of patients and donors.

* **Choice 1 (current choice)**: Delete `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects
created in previous `MatchCommand` executions when there is a new `MatchCommand` executed.
** Pros: No need to write extra code to store match results in the hard disk. Previous match results are overriden with new results
from the latest match command.
A scenario in which this would be important is if a user matches a patient, edits the patient information,
then runs the matching again. The matching would be based on the latest patient data.
** Cons: Redundant matching occurs in a scenario where the user executes a match command with the same parameters twice.

* **Choice 2:** For each patient, keep a list of match results. After every `MatchCommand` is executed, save
the match results to the hard disk.
** Pros: A history of match results can be stored. It reduces redundant matching.
** Cons: More code to write to store match results to the hard disk.

==== Aspect: Display of match results
This section explains some considerations for displaying match results,
which are stored in `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects.

* **Choice 1 (current choice):**: Display `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects in `PersonListPanel`
** Pros: Easy to implement because additional code is added to `PersonListPanel`, which is a UI component already existing in
AddressBook 3.
The constructor of `PersonListPanel` takes in an `ObservableList<Person>` object and creates
a list of `PersonListViewCell` objects to be displayed.
** Cons: The `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` classes need to inherit from the `Person` class, even though they represent
match results, not people.
* **Choice 2:** Create a new list panel called `MatchListPanel`, which displays objects of the `Match` class.
`MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` classes extend from the `Match` class.
** Pros: `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` classes do not inherit unwanted methods from `Person` class.
The `Match` class can contain methods more specific to matching.
** Cons: There would be two types of list panels. Upon executing each command, the correct list panel must be selected
and displayed.

// tag::formmode[]
=== Add person `Form` mode feature
This section explains the implementation of the adding person in `Form` mode feature.

==== Implementation

The `Form` mode mechanism is facilitated by `FormUiManager`.
It modifies the `CommandBox` as well as `PersonPanelListPlaceholder` each time a user input a specific attribute.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FormUiManager#getPersonField()` -- Modifies `CommandBox` and prompts the user to input a specific attribute.
* `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` -- Sets the value for all required attributes of a specific type of person.
* `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()` -- Adds a doctor to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()` -- Adds a patient to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` -- Adds a donor to the person list.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface when the specific command is invoked by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Form` mode mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add t/doctor` command to add a doctor in a `Form` mode. The `add` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` that will return a new `AddCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` executes the command and notice that the `Command` is a `Form` type command and thus will create a new `FormUiManager` instance.

Step 4. The `FormUiManager` changes the display of the application based on the type of the person specified in Step 1 by modifying the content of the `PersonListPanelPlaceholder` as well as the `CommandExecutor` in the `CommandBox` object by calling `FormUiManager#getPersonFields()`.

Step 5. The user inputs the attribute that is prompted until all the required attributes are specified.

Step 6. The user confirms the details of the person and `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` will be called and depending on the type of the person specified, calling `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` respectively.

Step 7. `FormUiManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to add the person and save it in the `Storage` interface.

==== Design Considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same `add` command to do the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May not be the best approach since one command will have two different modes.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new command for the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Will be less confusing for the user since there is a separate command for `Form` mode
** Cons: We must creates a new parser and command classes just to deal with another `add` functionality.

// end::formmode[]

=== Sort feature
This section describes how the sort feature is implemented.

Sorting is done by using `Comparators` in the `Logic` component and makes use of the `SortCommand`.
This command only works after a `MatchCommand` is called by the user, because it takes in `listOfMatches` returned
from calling a `MatchCommand`. Importantly, this `listOfMatches` is an `ObservableList`, which cannot be modified.
Therefore, it makes use of `SortedList` to wrap around the `ObservableList` so that the list can be modified by sorting.
The `boolean` in `CommandResult#setSort(boolean isSort)` will be set to `true` for a list that has been sorted.
Thus far, the sort command can only take in one `String` parameter, but more methods can be added in the future for more sorting options.

Three methods of sorting are implemented to sort based on the following categories:

* Sorting based on donor's organ expiry date with `sort expiry`
+
* Sorting based on priority with `sort priority`
+
* Sorting based on success rate of match with `sort rate`

These three methods' implementation will be further elaborated upon below.

==== Sort by Expiry
Sorting by Expiry sorts a list of `MatchedDonor` using the `ModelManager#sortByOrganExpiryDate()` method.

In this method, the `ExpiryComparator` is used to compare two matched donors' organ expiry date, and this requires
the `OrganExpiryDate` of the donors to be parsed into a date format that can be compared.

==== Sort by Success Rate
Sorting by Success Rate sorts a list of `MatchedPatient` using the `ModelManager#sortBySuccessRate()` method.

The `SuccessRateComparator` is created to compare two matched patients' rate of success for the match.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for the interactions with the `Logic` component for the `execute(sort rate)`,
assuming the user has entered a `match ic/**NRIC**` command before this.

.Structure of the Logic Component when executing `sort rate` command
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

After the command is given by the user, it would be parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.
The `SortCommandParser` then parses the parameter `rate` and a `SortCommand` is created.
The `LogicManager` will then execute the command and call the `sortBySuccessRate()` method from the `ModelManager`.
The list of `MatchedPatient` will then be sorted based on their match's success rate.

==== Sort by Priority
Sorting by Expiry sorts a list of `MatchedPatient` using the `ModelManager#sortByPriority()` method.

In this method, there are two other comparators created in addition to the `Priority Comparator`,
namely the `NameComparator` and the `NumOfMatchesComparator`. These two comparators serve as tie-breakers in cases where
patients have the same priority. In other words, for patients of the same priority, those with more matched donors will be displayed first.
If these two factors are the same for a group of patients, they will be displayed according to their names in alphabetical order.

Under the `sortByPriority()` method, the order of applying the comparators to the list of patients
is, firstly, the 'NameComparator', followed by `NumOfMatchesComparator`, and lastly, the `PriorityComparator`.
This means that the patients are first sorted by names in alphabetical order, followed by the number of matched donors they have
in descending order (highest to lowest), and then their priority level in descending order (from high, to medium, to low).

All three comparators makes use of the `compareTo` method under the `Comparable` class, which can sort in lexical order for String,
and numeric order for Sorting integers.
In particular, the `PriorityComparator` makes use of the `compareTo` method implemented in the `Priority` class.
A code snippet of this method is shown below.

```
@Override
public int compareTo(Priority priority) {
Integer thisPriorityNumber = 0;
Integer otherPriorityNumber = 0;

        if (this.isHighPriority()) {
            thisPriorityNumber = 3;
        } else if (this.isMediumPriority()) {
            thisPriorityNumber = 2;
        } else if (this.isLowPriority()) {
            thisPriorityNumber = 1;
        }
        if (priority.isHighPriority()) {
            otherPriorityNumber = 3;
        } else if (priority.isMediumPriority()) {
            otherPriorityNumber = 2;
        } else if (priority.isLowPriority()) {
            otherPriorityNumber = 1;
        }
        return thisPriorityNumber.compareTo(otherPriorityNumber);
    }
```

This implementation was the result of using `String` to represent the different priorities in the `Priority` class.
Therefore, they are converted into `Integer` for easier comparison. An alternative solution would be to make use of
`Enum` class to define each priority so that this `compareTo` method implementation can be simplified.

==== Design considerations
This section will explain two aspects considered in designing the sort feature.

===== Aspect: Method of storing sorted result
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `SortedList`.
** Pros: Fast iteration time of O(n * log n), which is important for ORGANice to load and display the sorted result, and more harmonious
with current implementations (able to wrap `ObservableList` and sort the content).
** Cons: It is not the most efficient algorithm for insertions or deletions, but ORGANice does not require them.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `ArrayList`.
** Pros: Fast index-based access and works on any `Collection` class.
** Cons: Iterating through the list to display the result takes O(n) time, which is slower than using `SortedList`.

===== Aspect: Method of sorting
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Comparator` and `Comparable`.
** Pros: Simpler implementation as able to make use of existing methods in ORGANice such as `setComparator`.
** Cons: More coding involved.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Collections.sort()`.
** Pros: Time complexity is O(n*log(n)) which is relatively fast.
** Cons: Cannot make use of existing methods in ORGANice that work for Comparator.

=== Processing feature
This section describes how the processing feature is implemented.

Processing is done by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`, then creating an ArrayList named, `ProcessingList` to store the tasks needed to do.

If the donor and patient pair had never been processed before, a default `ProcessingList` will be generated and it will belong to the patient and donor pair uniquely.

If the user made any changes to the `ProcessingList`, the list will be saved to the donor as one of its attribute which takes in a parameter of the patient's NRIC.

//Todo: additional feature such as add tasks, delete tasks etc

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Method of storing the `ProcessingList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use ArrayList to store the tasks.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: It is not the most efficient algorithm and the huge number of `ProcessingList` may take up a huge datafile at the end of the day.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new class that works like ArrayList.
** Pros: Able to implement more specific methods for the ProcessingList.
** Cons: More methods and test cases needed and it is harder to implement.

=== Finding feature
This section explains the implementation of the find persons by attributes feature.

==== Current Implementation
The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand`, `ExactFindCommand` and `PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate`. +

===== FindCommand


===== ExactFindCommand
`ExactFindCommand` extends `Command` with a `predicate` that is used to determine whether a given `person` should be
displayed. It implements `Command#execute(Model model)` which replaces the `predicate` of the current
`model.filteredPersons` with the input predicate of `ExactFindCommand`. +

TODO

===== PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate

TODO

===== Execution Behaviour
The behaviour of `FindCommand` and `ExactFindCommand` is consistent with that of other commands as described in
<<Design-Logic>>. Therefore, this section will gloss over higher-level details and instead zoom-in to the behaviour of
`FindCommand#execute` and `ExactFindCommand#execute.

====== FindCommand Execution

====== ExactFindCommand Execution

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour of `#execute` at each step. +

Step 1: The user inputs a find command, e.g. `find n/Marisha Rey n/Laura t/doctor t/donor`. It is parsed by
`FindCommandParser` and used to create an `ArgumentMultimap`: `argMultimap`.

Step 2: `argMultimap` is used to initialize a `PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate` object: `predicate`.

Step 3: `predicate` is used to initialize a `FindCommand` object. `#execute` is then called on it.

Step 4: `#execute` calls the `#updateFilteredPersonList` of the current `Model` which causes it's
`FilteredList<Person>`: `filteredPersons` to automatically filter out `persons` that fail `predicate#test`.

Step 5: `#updateFilteredPersonList` calls `#setDisplayedPersonList`.

Additional UI logic occurs but is not relevant in the scope of this explanation.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
