== Welcome to AddMin+

*AddMin+* is an all-in-one administration desktop application, that is specially designed for any events management start-up company with limited manpower and resources.
These companies would usually only be able to afford to hire one admin staff to handle both the management of events and employees and this can be tough.
The Admin+ Team understands the struggles that start-ups face daily, and we are here to help!

*AddMin+* is specially designed to ease the workload of the admin and allow him/her to effectively handle the administrative tasks of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and deletion, editing of event details after creation, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an overview of all the data via statistics.
The purpose of this user guide is to show the user how they can use our app to carry out their administrative tasks efficiently and also answer any questions they may have while using our app.

== Getting Started

=== Installation
. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `AddMin+.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to a *new empty folder* which you want to use as the home folder for AddMin+
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

=== CLI Usage & Command Formatting

*Command Format*

As a CLI application, most commands are executed by typing your commands on the Command Box. We will discuss the exact commands that you may execute under the <<Features>> section, but it is important to first understand the format of the command.

Commands start with a single string (which may include underscores) such as `add_em` or `free`. Subsequently, you supply the prefix, for example, `n/` and then the necessary parameter. It is alright if there is spacing within your parameter. The prefixes and parameters will be stated for each command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the *compulsory* parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add_em n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_em n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are *optional* e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME no/PHONE_NUMBER`, `no/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Previous commands can be accessed by using the *up/down arrow keys*.
* Not following the specific format will trigger an _Invalid Command Format_ error message on the result display box.

[[Constraints]]

[[Features]]
== Features

====
The features of AddMin+ can be grouped into 4 main categories, General, Entity Management, Finance, Schedule, and Statistics.
The commands that AddMin+ recognize follows a specific format, however, each category will have their own set of valid commands.
For new users, do refer to the subsections under Section 3 for the specific command and how to use them.
For more advanced users, you could refer to <<Command Summary>>.
====

=== General Commands

==== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `exit`

==== Navigation between Tabs : `main` | `schedule`

Provides a way to jump between the Main and Schedule Tab.

[TIP]
A Schedule-related command executed in the Main Tab will direct you to the Schedule Tab. While an
Employee-related command executed in the Schedule Tab will not be allowed as the user does not have an employee list
to refer to in the Schedule Tab. Lastly, all Event-related command is executed based on the current Event list that is
being displayed, regardless if the user is in the Main Tab or Schedule Tab.

Main Tab: `main`

Schedule Tab: `schedule`

=== Entity Management

AddMin+ contains two main entities - Employees and Events with similar commands, especially in __Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)__ operations.

==== List : `list | list_em | list_ev`

Employee: Shows the list of all employees on the company’s roster.
Full details are truncated.

Event: Shows the list of all events on the company’s calendar.

[[set_ev_dt]]
==== Setting a Date&Time to an Event: `set_ev_dt`

Sets a Date-Time Schedule Mapping for a specific Event.

[NOTE]
Even though the start date and end dates of each event is stated, the event is not assumed to be held for the entire range. Hence, the Date-Time setting feature enables the user to _declare and set_ the schedule of the event. Events are initialized without any schedule, other than their stated start and end date with a default time of __0800-1800__.

Format: `set_ev_dt EVENT_INDEX [on/EVENT_DATE] [till/EVENT_DATE] time/EVENT_DAYTIME`

****
* Note the <<Constraints>> for *INDEX*, *DATE*, and *TIME PERIOD*.
* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are *not used*, then all dates inclusive of the start to end date of the target event will be set with the stated `EVENT_DAYTIME`.
* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are used, then the date range (inclusive) from the start to end date stated will be set with the stated `EVENT_DAYTIME`.
* If *only* the `on/` prefix is used, it will just set the `EVENT_DAYTIME` for the __single__ stated `EVENT_DATE`.
* The `till/` prefix must be used with the `on/` prefix, and not by itself.
* All `EVENT_DATE` *must be within the range of the Target Event's Start and End Date*
* The `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `on/` prefix cannot be after the `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `till/` prefix
****

Examples:

* `set_ev_dt 2 on/02/10/2019 time/1000-2000` +
Sets the 2nd Event from the Event List a time period of 10am-8pm on the 2nd of October 2019.

* `set_ev_dt 3 time/0500-1500` +
Sets the 3rd Event from the Event List a time period of 5am-3pm on all dates from the start to the end date (inclusive) of the Event.

* `set_ev_dt 1 on/02/10/2019 till/10/10/2019 time/0500-1500` +
Sets the 1st Event from the Event List a time period of 5am-3pm on all dates from the 2nd of October to the 10th of October (inclusive).

==== Delete a DateTime Mapping from an Event: `delete_ev_dt`

Deletes Date-Time mappings for a specific event by stating a single date or a range of dates.

Format: `delete_ev_dt EVENT_INDEX on/EVENT_DATE [till/EVENT_DATE]`

* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are used, then the Date-Time mapping for the date range (inclusive) from the start to end date stated will be deleted.
* If *only* the `on/` prefix is used, it will just delete the Date_Time mapping for the __single__ stated `EVENT_DATE`.
* All `EVENT_DATE` *must be within the range of the Target Event's Start and End Date*
* The `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `on/` prefix cannot be after the `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `till/` prefix
****

Example:

* `delete_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019` +
Deletes the Date-Time mapping on 18th October from the 2nd Event on the Event list.

* `delete_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019 till/22/10/2019` +
Deletes all Date-Time mappings that lie in the range of 18th - 22nd of October 2019 from the 2nd Event on the Event list.

//tag::Schedule[]
=== Schedule Management
Welcome to Schedule! Looking for a way to display and see what events you have on a specific Date or Month?
Want to have an overview of all the dates where you have an event? Then you are at the right place!

To get things started, all Schedule-related commands occur in the Schedule Tab as seen from the figure below.
You can get to the Schedule Tab easily by either clicking on the Schedule Tab on the User Interface or
just simply type in any Schedule-related commands and AddMin+ will bring you there.

[NOTE]
====
- All Event-Related commands that are done in the Schedule Tab, will be referencing the Event List displayed in the Schedule Tab.
- All Employee-Related commands are disabled in the Schedule Tab, as there is no Employee List being displayed in the Schedule Tab.
====

._User Interface (UI) of the Schedule Feature_
image::ScheduleUiDetailed.png[]

---

==== Display Schedule for a specific date: `display_schedule_date`
Want to check if you have any events on a specific date? Instead of looking through the entire list of events you have, you
could use the `display_schedule_date` command to do it!

Format: `display_schedule_date on/dd/MM/yyyy`

Examples:
`display_schedule_date on/02/12/2019`

****
* Note the <<Constraints>> for *DATE*.
****

**Example: To display schedule for a specific date (20/11/2019):**

**Step 1**.  Either type `display_schedule_date on/20/11/2019` into the command box or click on
the specific date from the date picker as seen from the figure below.

image::ScheduleUiStep1.png[]

**Step 2**.  The result box will display a message informing you how many events are being listed. In this case, the message displayed
is "1 event listed!"

image::ScheduleUiStep2.png[]

**Step 3**.  In the event list, you will be able to see all the events that are on the specified date. In this case, the only event that is on
20/11/2019 is "Talk by DEF Company".

image::ScheduleUiStep3.png[]

[NOTE]
====
- The event list will be empty and not display anything if there is no event on the specified date.
- The command is designed to give an overview of the user's schedule and is based on the event's Start and End date.
It does not take into account of the event's set date and time.
(To have a more detailed view of the event, simply double click on that event).
- As long as the user's specified input date falls between the event's start and end date, the event will be displayed.
====

---

==== Display Schedule for a specific Month and Year: `display_schedule_month`
Now you would want to see all the events you have on a specific month and year. Instead of looking through the list of events you have, you
could use the `display_schedule_month` command to do it!

Format: `display_schedule_month for/MM/yyyy`

****
* for/ represents the month and year in MM/yyyy that the user wants to display
* Note the <<Constraints>> for *DATE*.
