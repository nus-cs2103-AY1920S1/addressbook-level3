== Project Portfolio for Tan Ye Kai

=== About the Project

Jarvis was developed by {gh_team}[AY1920-CS2103T-T10-1]. We are a team
based in the {nus_comp}[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph into student-life planner application
called JARVIS. This enhanced application enables students to track their daily tasks, find module information, track
their finances and monitor their Ccas.

We chose to enhance AddressBook into a Student Lifestyle application named
**Jarvis**. Jarvis is meant to be able to manage many aspects of a regular
university student's life - anywhere from finances to university course
planning.

My role was to implement the Cca tracker feature. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more
detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these
enhancements.

Shown below is the UI of Jarvis, showing my feature:

=== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of coding, documentation, and other helpful
contributions to this team project. The link to the code I have contributed
can be found at https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/commits?author=mrnewguy[this link].

==== Cca Tracker

The feature I have provided within Jarvis is a **Cca Tracker** - using this
feature you are able to add and track any Cca. This is
one of the big features (out of 4) of Jarvis.

===== Justification

60% of NUS students have at least 1 non-academic commitment while 30% have more than 1 non-academic commitment.
Very frequently, students staying in Halls/Residential colleges can have upwards of 5 non-academic commitments.
Consequently, it can be overwhelming to keep track of the details of each Cca. This feature provides a simple and
intuitive tool to help users keep track of their commitments and their progress in the Cca.

==== Other Contributions

This sums up my contributions to the project that were not directly related to
my main feature - Cca Tracker.

* *User Interface*

** Overhaul of UI backend
+
I oversaw the adapting of the graphical user interface. Most importantly, I made a number of non-trivial additions to
the model, logic and ui components so that developers of the project could switch between tabs in the application.
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/189[#189]

** Implemented a new graphical user interface layout
+
I also oversaw the changing of the graphical user interface layout from the original AB3 layout to our new layout. This
new layout was chosen because we believed that the command box would be better suited to be placed at the bottom of
the tabs rather than on top of it, as it allowed for the user to better visualise the changes to the UI as new commands
are entered.
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/323[#323]

** Added the helpdesk box
+
In an attempt to streamline the user experience even further, I implemented
the Helpdesk box. This serves as a mini 'user guide' to the user so that they will know all the commands that can be
used for each feature.

* *Community*
** I have also reviewed several pull requests from my team mates (with non-trivial
review comments), as can be seen from pull requests
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/104[#104]
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/136[#136]

** Lastly, I reported bugs and offered helpful suggestions for  another
application created by my fellow cohort mates. This can be seen from the
following examples in this https://github.com/mrnewguy/ped/issues[link].


==== Contributions to User Guide

We were put in charge of our own sections of the User Guide content while
another member had styled and verified the cohesiveness of the User Guide as a
whole. The following is a small excerpt of my section in the User Guide. It shows the entire process of incrementing
 a Cca's progress for a Cca. This process consists of both the `add-progress` and `increase-progress` command in the
 `CcaTracker` feature.

'''

==== Add progress levels for a CCA: `add-progress`
Often, we strive to reach certain milestones in our CCAs. For example, in learning the swimming, you might be aiming to
progress through the various grade levels available. With `add-progress`,
`Jarvis` can help you set and keep track of your progress towards each milestone in swimming.

Format: `add-progress INDEX p/MILESTONE...`

==== Step 1
Select a Cca which currently does not have a progress yet.

[NOTE]
This step assumes that you have already added a swimming `Cca` to the `CcaTracker`.


==== Step 2
Add a progress to the selected `Cca` using the `add-progress` command.

==== Step 3
Increment the progress on the selected `Cca` using the `increment-progress` command.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each component in the `Progress Tracker` segment of each `Cca`.

[NOTE]
Note that progress can only be incremented if `add-progress` has previously been executed on that particular Cca
(see steps 1 and 2!)

'''

==== Contributions to Developer Guide
Similar to the user guide, my team also decided that each member should be responsible to write their own documentation
in the developer guide for their individual feature.

===== Course Planner Section

The following is an excerpt for my own section of the Developer Guide. Some
of the sections have been stripped down to accommodate the page limit.

'''

==== The CcaTracker Model

The `CcaTracker` class within the model provides an interface between the
components of the feature and the updating of the overall model. Like other
features, `Model` is associated with the cca tracker feature by
implementing `CcaTrackerModel`, from which `Model` implements.

Some of the more significant methods within the `CcaTracker` are shown
below:

* `Model#updateFilteredCcaList(Predicate<Cca> predicate)` -- Updates the
  `FilteredCcaList` by passing it a predicate.

* `Model#getFilteredCcaList()` -- Returns an instance of the `FilteredCcaList`

* `Model#addProgress(Cca targetCca, CcaProgressList toAddCcaProgressList)` -
Adds `CcaProgressList` to the target `Cca`.

* `Model#increaseProgress(Index index)` -- Increases the progress of the `Cca`


==== Cca Tracker components
The class diagram for CcaTrackerModel is shown below:

.CcaTracker Class Diagram
image::ModelCcaTrackerClassDiagram.png[]

As seen in the diagram above, The `CcaTracker` consists primarily of a single `CcaList` object. This `CcaList` object is
essentially a wrapper around an `ObservableList` of `Cca` objects. Do note that the `CcaList` object can contain any
number of `Cca` objects (including none).

More interestingly, each `Cca` is made up of the following components, all of which are **non-nullable** attributes:

** CcaName
** CcaType
** EquipmentList
** CcaProgress

Now that we have an understanding of the underlying implementation of `CcaTracker`, lets take a closer look at the
feature details.

==== Feature details

CcaTracker has 7 specific commands that support the given operations to mutate
the state of the `Model`. Each command is represented as seperate class. They include the following classes:
`AddCcaCommand`, `DeleteCcaCommand`, `EditCcaCommand`, `FindCcaCommand`, `ListCcaCommand`, `AddProgressCommand` and
`IncreaseProgressCommand`.

For brevity's sake, we will illustrate only 1 specific command and its
execution on model.

The following activity diagram illustrates how a `Cca` 's
progress is incremented when a user types in an `increase-progress` command:

===== Increasing a cca's progress

.Activity Diagram for increase-progress command
image::ccatracker/IncreaseCcaProgressActivityDiagram.png[]

Firstly , before any increasing of progress can take place, the user has to add a `Cca` to the `CcaTracker` through the
`add-cca` command. The user then has to add a `CcaMilestoneList` to the `CcaTracker` through the `add-progress` command.

[NOTE]
Note that the execution of each command as stated above branches off into different scenarios, all of which present
themselves to the user in form of prompts in the user interface.

==== Command Execution
The diagram below shows the sequence diagram of the increase-progress mechanism.

.Sequence diagram for increase-progress command
image::ccatracker/IncreaseProgressSequenceDiagram.png[]


Given below is an example usage scenario of how the increase-progress mechanism
behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CcaTracker`
is initialized. Assume that a `Cca` has already been added to the Cca and that
a progress tracker has already been set for that `Cca`.

Step 2. The user executes `increase-progress 1` command to increment the
progress of the 1st `Cca` in the CcaTracker. A `IncreaseProgressCommandParser`
object is created and its `#parse` method is called. The parse method returns
a new `IncreaseProgressCommand` object.

Step 3. The `IncreaseProgressCommand` object is then executed on model. The
`IncreaseProgressCommand#execute` method is called and in this method, the
`Model#increaseProgress` method is called.

[NOTE]
The `IncreaseProgressCommand#execute` method first checks for whether the
index is within the size of CcaList.

Step 4. As mentioned in section 2, the methods in `Model` merely mirrors the
methods in the `CcaTracker` class. As such, the `CcaTracker#increaseProgress`
method is called. This in turn calls the `CcaList#increaseProgress` method.
This method first finds the `Cca` based on its corresponding index. Then, it
calls the `Cca#increaseProgress` method.

Step 5. This in turn calls the `CcaProgress#increaseProgress` method that
calls `CcaCurrentProgress#increaseProgress` method. At long last, the final
`#increaseProgress` method in the `CcaCurrentProgress` instance is called and
the `currentProgress` counter is incremented by 1.

[NOTE]
In short, the calling of the `#increaseProgress` method at the `CcaTracker` level
triggers a cascading series of `#increaseProgress` methods which culminates in
the `currentProgress` variable being incremented by 1.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Whether to have subclasses for each type of cca.

* *Option 1: Instantiate a `CcaProgress` object for
each `Cca`*
This entails implementing `CcaProgess` class as consisting of a `CcaMilestoneList` and a `CcaCurrentProgess`. The

** Pros: Less code needed.
** Cons: Less extensible as CcaProgress is now limited to what is essentially a list of strings.

* *Option 2: Implement `CcaProgress` as a parent class.*
This entails creating classes such as SportProgress/PerformingArtsProgress that extend from CcaProgress for each type
of `Cca`. Such an implementation can be represented using the class diagram below:

.Class diagram showing the alternative implementation of CcaProgress.
image::ccatracker/AlternativeCcaProgressClassDiagram.png[]

** Pros: Easier to extend functionality for each type of cca.
** Cons: Does not significantly extend functionality for this version of
Jarvis.

===== Our Thoughts
After much consideration, we have decided to implement `CcaProgress` as per option 1. This is because we wish to afford
the user the flexibility to set whichever milestones they wish to in their Cca.

Option 2 would entail hardcoding a certain type of `CcaMilestone` for each type of `CcaProgress`. For example,
each `UniformedGroupProgress` might have included a series of `CcaMilestoneRanks`, where the user can set each
CcaMilestoneRanks to be ranks such as Private, Lance Corporal, Corporal, Sergeant etc. Then, the
`UniformedGroupProgress` could have individualised attributes such as types of awards etc.

However, in light of the fact that Jarvis is a CLI application, it would have been extremely cumbersome for the user to
type the myriad number of options.

===== Aspect: Whether to use observable list for `CcaProgressList`

* *Option 1 : Implement CcaProgressList as an
  `ObservableList`*
** Pros: Easier to manipulate for JavaFx.
** Cons: Potentially complicated nesting when passing arguments to it as
CcaProgressList is nested several classes within `Cca`.

* *Option 2: Implement CcaProgressList as a normal `List` e.g.
  `ArrayList`.*
** Pros: Does not require predicates to be passed in.
** Cons: Might be more complicated when rendering in Javafx.

===== Our Thoughts
Implementing the `CcaProgressList` as an `ArrayList` would have been an easier option. However, the implementation of
the `CcaProgressList` as an `ObservableList` proved to be a wiser choice as `Javafx` fully supports the manipulation and
rendering of an `ObservableList`. Using an `ArrayList`  would have made the building of the ui thoroughly cumbersome.
