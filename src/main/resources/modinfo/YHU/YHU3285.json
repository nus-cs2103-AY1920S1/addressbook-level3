    "description": "Rebellions and revolutions offer us moments through which to examine both disruptions and continuities in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Vietnamese history. This course studies Vietnam\u2019s past though its own cultural production of knowledge, and it investigates Vietnam\u2019s ethnic minority revolts, anti-colonial rebellions, and the literary revolution of the 1920s and 1930s. The major historical periods covered in this class are: territorial expansion, colonization, independence, and war. We will read the political and literary works that emerged during these periods, which include poems, short stories, novels, manifestos, and films. Note: the works will be studied in translation.",
