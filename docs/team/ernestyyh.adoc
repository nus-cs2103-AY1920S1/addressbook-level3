== Introduction

*Plan²travel* is a desktop travel planning application. The application is targeted at fellow university students who
travel infrequently and would greatly benefit from an application that helps organize their travelling information when they plan their own itinerary. Plan²travel has the ability to store and display information such as activities, accommodations, contacts and an itinerary which comprises of a list of day. Each day is displayed with a list of activities that is scheduled. +

The user interacts with the application using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has Graphical User Interface GUI created with JavaFX.

It is cross-platform and can be compiled for both Windows and Mac OS.

Below is a screenshot of our application:

== Summary of contributions
|===
|Below is a summary of the contributions that I have made to the project.
|===

=== *Major enhancement*: +
* *Added and modified commands to facilitate trip management*
** *What it does:* allows the user to create new trips, load and rename existing trips, make copies
of existing trips and also clear existing trip information.

** *Justification:* This feature improves the product significantly because it allow users to plan for multiple
trips. This removes the initial limitation of only being able to plan for a single trip at a time.
Under the initial limitation, users would have had to constantly overwrite their trip plans and lose any previous
plans that they have made.
