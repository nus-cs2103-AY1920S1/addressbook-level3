    "description": "This module provides students with both basic concepts and applications for the synthesis and handling of particulate materials, covering various topics such as colloids and fine particles, pharmaceutical particle synthesis and processing, dynamics of particulate systems, fluidization, pneumatic conveying and standpipe, electrostatics for particle processing, particulate flow metering and tomography, discreate element method and continuum modeling. Particulate solids are characterised in terms of size, size distribution, measurement and analysis and processing such as comminution and mixing. The pharmaceutical, biomedical and energy applications of particle technology will be covered at the end of the module.",
