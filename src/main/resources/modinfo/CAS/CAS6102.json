    "description": "This course provides students with a historical overview of ideas and practices related to East Asia regionalism. Beginning with early ideas of Asia and interactions between Japan, China, and Korea, the course goes on to examine the various ways regional integration has been conceived of and implemented over history. While comparative in nature, the course also offers a focused analysis of one comprehensive attempt at regional integration: Japanese Pan-Asianism. The course further examines in detail postwar and contemporary ideas of East Asian integraion and the various ongoing attempts by multiple regional actors to facilitate working partnerships within the Asia Pacific.",
