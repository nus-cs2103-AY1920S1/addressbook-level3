== Introduction
Seller Manager Lite (SML) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their sales*. More importantly, SML is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SML can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Get started on this journey by installing SML and take a quick tour of our main features.

[underline]#Format#: `exit`

If there are any statistics window open when executing this, the application will not terminate until those windows are closed too.

// tag::statisticsCommandUG[]
=== Generate stats: `generate-s`

`v1.4` only allows statistics on orders marked as `Completed` and has a  `Schedule`.

This function calculates the three type of
statistics as shown below.

All statistics that are calculated are only on orders in the `archived panel` that has been `completed` and with a valid `schedule`.
Lacking any of this will cause its non-inclusion into the statistics calculation.
The value calculated is the sum over the total time period within a month, meaning that it will take the date period,
calculate the statistics for orders within that time period, split it by month and display it.

e.g Total `revenue` between 2019.11.12 and 2019.11.29 will calculate the order between these 2 dates, sum up the revenue
(as it falls within a single month) and
display this value.

* Accepts two types of input:
** Without date input - display total value for that particular statistics.
** with date input - displays chart (Monthly value) and total value for that particular statistics.  +

Generates the statistics with no date input. +


Used for calculating `total profit`, `total revenue` and `total cost`. +
Format: `generate-s s/stat` +

Type for `stat` includes: `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` +
The argument must match these three words perfectly.

Shown below:

image::StatsExampleDefault.png[width="300"]

Generates the statistics with date input in chart format (in pop-up modal dialogue). +
Format: `generate-s s/stat d1/YYYY.MM.DD d2/YYYY.MM.DD` +
Example: `generate-s s/revenue d1/2019.10.16 d2/2019.11.21` +
Format for the date is in YYYY.MM.DD e.g `2019.05.12`

Shown below:

image::StatsExampleGraph.png[]

// end::statisticsCommandUG[]
[TIP]
Date should be in the format YYYY.MM.DD with valid year, month and date. Only dates from year 1970 onwards are valid.
[TIP]
For dates in YYYY.MM.DD, the MM and DD argument can omit the leading 0 e.g `2019.1.1` is valid
as long as the date is valid
[TIP]
Accuracy is guaranteed up to $0.01 *only*
[TIP]
The statistic type argument must match `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` (no upper case)

Limitations:

* Range of dates affecting chart display
** The chart can accept a large range of dates, but take note that above a
certain threshold the gap between the months will change, depending on how large of a range you are calculating.
This behaviour is intentional and not a bug.

* Date range starts from 1970 onwards
** Date of year input starts from 1970 onwards. This is enough to fit our use case. Anything lower will be rejected.

* Auto truncation of labels and values
** the X-axis labels will adjust automatically based on the range of inputs. This is intended to give users the
flexibility with regards to the range of dates to be inputted. Above a certain range the interval between x-axis data
will decrease e.g 2 months. Above a certain values, labels will be replaced by standard notation e.g 9999999E8.

* Stats window data not updating
** If you already have a stats window open and you complete an order,
you will have to re-enter the statistic command to update that value in another window.

* Manually Close the Statistic window before typing `exit` on the main app
** If you already have a stats window open before you enter the `exit` command, the application will only stop running
when the remaining statistic windows are closed manually.

* Load time:
** Do not be alarmed if the window does not pop up immediately upon click. For larger data sets
we estimate at least a few seconds before the window will be loaded.

==== Average Statistics `[coming in v2.0]`
** More advanced commands like `average profit` etc.

==== Different Charts `[coming in v2.0]`
** Instead of just being able to display via a line chart, users will be able to select the type of chart

==== Export Chart to PDF `[coming in v2.0]`
** User will be able to export their charts to pdf with a click of a button.

=== Export data: `export`

Exports application data into csv file. +
If csv file of the input file name exists, the application data will be exported to the existing file. +
If csv file of the input file name does not exist, the application data will be exported into a new file. +

. Write the export command: `Export FILENAME`

****

. The CSV file of file name "FILENAME" will be created in the data folder.

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete
As you type into the command line, suggestions will appear.

A maximum of 8 suggestions will appear in a dropdown menu, sorted by their degree of
similarity to the entered text.

image::AutoCompleteCommandExample.png[]

[TIP]
Suggestions in _Cyan_ mean that the entire word is suggested.

[TIP]
Suggestions in _Yellow_ mean that the word is partially matched.

[TIP]
The system may lag and not work if you are typing too fast.

[TIP]
The system is case-sensitive.

==== `add`

image::AutoCompleteAddExample.png[]

*** When you enter `add-c` followed by a space, the system will suggest
a list of prefixes you can enter, such as `n/`.

*** When you enter `add-c n/`, the system will suggest a list of names that
belong to existing customers. This is helpful in checking if the data you are
entering is duplicated.

*** The list of data that is suggested depends on the prefix that is last entered.
For instance, if the last entered prefix was `e/`, it would instead suggest a
list of existing emails.

****
* As `add-c`, `add-p` and `add-o` commands can accept an unlimited number of tags,
the system will endlessly suggest `t/` prefixes and `Tag` arguments after all
compulsory arguments are entered.

* Autocomplete works similarly for all `add` commands and `generate-s`.

* Even though these commands do not require the prefixes and arguments to be in
any specified order, the autocomplete system enforces an artificial order to reduce
confusion.

* When you alter data in the application, the suggestions will be updated
accordingly.
****

==== `delete`

image::AutoCompleteDeleteExample.png[]

*** For commands such as `delete-c` which take only a single index and
no additional arguments, the system will suggest two numbers: `1` and `N`,
where `N` is the largest valid index that can be entered. In this case,
`N` corresponds to the number of customers displayed on the customer panel.

****
* Commands of this type include `delete`, `copy`, `complete`, `cancel`.
****

==== `edit`

*** When you enter `edit-c` followed by a space, the system will suggest
two numbers: `1` and `N`, where `N` is the largest valid index that can
be entered.

*** When you enter `edit-c 1` followed by a space, the system will
suggest a list of prefixes you can enter, such as `n/`, `c/`, `e/`.

*** When you enter `edit-c 1 c/`, the system will suggest a list of
contact numbers that belong to existing customers.
This is helpful in checking if the data you are editing to is duplicated.

*** The list of suggestions depends on the prefix that is last
entered. If the last entered prefix was `i/`, it would instead suggest a
list of existing identity numbers.

****
* As edit commands allow for optional arguments and multiple same arguments,
the system is designed to always suggest the entire set of possible prefixes.

* Autocomplete works similarly for all `edit` commands.
****

==== `find`

image::AutoCompleteFindExample.png[]

*** When you enter `find-c` followed by a space, the system will suggest
values from every attribute of every customer in the database.

****
* As `find` commands accept an unlimited number of keywords, the system
will endlessly suggest the same set of possible keywords when a space is
entered.

* Autocomplete works similarly for all `find` commands.
****


==== `switch`

*** For simple commands such as `switch-c`, the system will suggest the command word
and nothing else.

****
* Simple commands include `switch`, `export`, `list`, `clear`, `undo`, `redo`, `history`, `exit`, `help`.
****

==== `schedule`

image::AutoCompleteScheduleExample.png[]

*** When you enter `schedule` followed by a space, the system will suggest
dates that already have orders scheduled on them. This is helpful in
checking for duplicates.
