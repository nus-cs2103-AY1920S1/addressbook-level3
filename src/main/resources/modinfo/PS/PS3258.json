    "description": "This module provides a survey of different methodological approaches to the study of political science: single case studies, qualitative comparative analysis, and a variety of quantitative methods. The module focuses more on applications than theories, and explains how political questions can be investigated using different types of data and methods. All students are expected to have completed PS2102B (Political Inquiry) or an equivalent introductory research methodology module. Students are required to work on group research projects and present their findings at the end of the semester.",
