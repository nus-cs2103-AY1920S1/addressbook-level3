    "description": "This module examines the dynamics of urban and regional development from the perspectives of economic and political geography. It is primarily concerned with contemporary issues such as urban assemblages and clusters, regional networks and institutions, and their relationships with the evolving global political economy. Uneven geographical development is both underpinned by, and contributes to, these urban and regional development dynamics around the world. The module will draw upon a wide variety of examples from across Asia.",
