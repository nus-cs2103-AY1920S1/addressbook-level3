    "description": "This module is intended to function as a survey of detective fiction as a genre with a transhistorical framework, spanning work from the 1860s to the present. Topics covered will include: the historical conditions influencing the rise of detective fiction as a genre; the epistemological and sociological issues which inform our readings and our own desire as readers to uncover the mysterious; how the detective figure relates to the literary critic and the philosopher; the division between public/private spheres; the formal and thematic shifts in the genre and its pre-modern, modern and postmodern manifestations.",
