    "description": "Whether as a pleasurable pastime, a medium of self-expression, a target of activism, or a topic of academic inquiry, food seems to be on everyone\u2019s mind these days. A topic long ignored in formal academic research, the recent revitalization of food studies has sparked new critical dialogues within and among disciplines. This course offers an overview of key perspectives on the study of food, including food culture, food security, and food politics/policy, drawing from anthropology and closely related disciplines. It is designed for anthropology majors, and is of relevance to students of other majors with an interest in food systems.",
