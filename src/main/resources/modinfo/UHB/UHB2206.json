    "description": "This course adopts an eclectic, multi-disciplinary approach towards leadership. Through a section on Core Ideas and Great Texts, it highlights the key tensions and complexities involved in leaders\u2019 decision-making, exemplified in seminal thinkers\u2019 work on how to determine the 'right' and / or 'good'; and explores how these tensions/complexities play out in a selection of Great Texts, both literary and philosophical. A section on Contemporary Issues applies the ideas of leadership tension/complexity to current leadership challenges. A student-selected USPitch Project provides a first-hand practical experience of the issues explored in earlier sections.",
