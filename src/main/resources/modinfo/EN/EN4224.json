    "description": "The course provides students with knowledge of modernist texts, which they will analyse for their aesthetic, political and ideological strategies. Students will examine modernism as both a reaction to and a constituent part of modernity and will produce informed critical arguments about the historical, economic and technological developments that constitute modernity. Lectures will examine relationships that existed between literature and other cultural forms, like painting, architecture, music, and contemporary intellectual movements such as existential philosophy and psychoanalytic theory. The module is targeted at students interested in modern literature, art and thought, with at least 28 MCs in literature.",
