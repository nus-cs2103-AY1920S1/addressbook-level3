    "description": "This module focuses on integrating Design Thinking into the creative development of innovative products and services. It is a human-centric approach with emphasis on user desirability, technology feasibility and business viability. Increasingly, companies compete beyond technologies, and the use of Design Thinking (such as Apple\u2019s iTune, iPOD & iPhone) has created world-leading products. The Singapore\u2019s Economic Strategies Committee has proposed design-driven innovation as a national competitive strategy. This module is developed with the support of DesignSinagpore Council (Dsg), Ministry of Information, communication & the Arts (MICA). Dsg is the national agency on design promotion for the Singapore\u2019s economy. Students will also attend industry forums and networking sessions. Module will be delivered via case studies",
