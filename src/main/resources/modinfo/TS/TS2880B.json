    "description": "This module trains students in the fundamental principles of Jerzy Grotowski\u2019s approach to the actor\u2019s craft. It is conducted full-time over a short period, in the pedagogy of an intensive physical process needed to develop embodied knowledge. Students learn principles of organicity, relation, contact, impulse, intention, action and reaction. They examine the relation between process and form, in order to arrive at reflexive understanding of the difference between performing movement and action. Through the physical training exclusively developed by the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards, they practice singing ancient songs and develop individual and collective acting scenes.",
