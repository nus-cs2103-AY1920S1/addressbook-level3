    "description": "This module aims to provide an opportunity for the students to learn commonly-used network protocols in greater technical depth with their implementation details than a basic networking course. Students will perform hands-on experiments in configuring and interconnecting LANs using networking devices/technologies (e.g., routers, switches, SDN switches, and hubs), networking protocols (e.g., DHCP, DNS, RIP, OSPF, ICMP, TCP, UDP, wireless LAN, VLAN protocols, SIP, SSL, IPSec-VPN) and networking tools (e.g, tcpdump, netstat, ping, traceroute). Students will learn higher-layer network protocols and develop network applications (client/server, P2P) via socket programming.",
