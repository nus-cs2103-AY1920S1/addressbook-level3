    "description": "All emerging economies face common challenges: usually, inadequate resources; otherwise, waste and distortion; often, corruption and technological deficiency. Developed nations can demonstrate best practice. But they can also foist on developing countries restrictions on favoured pathways to success: tight boundaries between state and market; interpretations of political freedoms; intellectual property rights regimes; open capital markets; a constraining carbon-sensitive global environment - conditions that, while claimed universalist, did not operate when today's advanced economies started their climb to success. All these problems test Asia's emerging economies: this course develops economic models to help policymakers understand and deal with these challenges.",
