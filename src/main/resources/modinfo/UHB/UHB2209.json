    "description": "This module takes an inter-disciplinary look at the multifarious concept of 'governance' - how resources, issues and groups are organised and managed by a range of actors from the public, private and people sectors. Through a combination of academic work and case studies, the module explores (i) under what circumstances, and how, governance in the modern world needs to be more 'polycentric' \u2013 taking place at multiple interlocking levels, including the global, national and local; (ii) key determinants of success or failure in different instances of polycentricity; (iii) both the benefits and limitations inherent in polycentric governance arrangements, as well as the challenges and obstacles to achieving greater polycentricity.",
