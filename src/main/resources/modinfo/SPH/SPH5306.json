    "description": "Rapid urbanisation has resulted in an increasingly built environment with new dynamic interactions between the natural (biosphere) and man-made (technosphere). This in turn leads to emerging health concerns peculiar to an urbanised built environment. Events in the natural environment continue to be of public health importance, especially climate change as evidenced by extreme weather events. In addition, the workplace environment is of special concern as most adults spend the greater proportion of their waking hours there. This module will introduce students to important issues in environmental and occupational health and equip them with basic skills in identifying and mitigating environmental risk factors, both in the general and workplace environment.",
