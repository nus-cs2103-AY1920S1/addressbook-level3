For this, it examines the history, technology and business practices that determine the structure and outputs of media industries (especially, those of Singapore). After being exposed to key theoretical frameworks, students will study the management structures, procedures, policies, and goals of a variety of media operations, including newspapers, magazine, advertising, broadcasting, cable, and online media. For CNM, FASS and SoC students",
