Description is revised to, \"Singapore's rapid growth and transformation has led it to become one of the world's greatest economic success stories. Widely acclaimed as an economic miracle, Singapore's success can be attributed to a series of deliberate and responsive economic and tax policies which have ensured its sustained macroeconomic stability and attractiveness to foreign investment. Students will be introduced to the history of Singapore's experience as an open economy seen through the lens of tax policy. The module will enable students to trace the development of Singapore's economic progressas they are given a chronological walk-through of the development of Singapore's tax system. Students will have opportunity to explore the unique and key features of various tax policies (e.g. tax incentives and tax measures) which were integral in promoting the rapid industrialization and growth of specific sectors in the Singapore economy which are still relevant today. The module aims to provide students with insights into the rationale behind these policies and their implementation. This module intends to stimulate critical thinking and engage students in intellectual discourse on the impact and effectiveness of various tax policies and continued relevance of these policies which continue to contribute to Singapore's sustained prosperity and success in the Asean community and on the global stage.\"",
