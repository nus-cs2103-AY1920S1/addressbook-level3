    "description": "Indiscriminate use of the Earth by humans has precipitated in the \u2018sixth mass extinction\u2019. Conservation is a mission-oriented scientific enterprise to protect Earth\u2019s animals, plants, and ecosystems by applying principles from various natural and social sciences. This module will equip students with the knowledge required to engage in critical dialogue regarding conservation activities with different audiences (e.g. academic, policy maker). The course covers topics related to protecting biodiversity and uses geospatial technologies to evaluate conservation plans. While looking at conservation from a holistic perspective, the module lays special emphasis on how conservation plans affect local communities.",
