The syllabus focusses on relational database applications implemented with relational database management systems. Topics covered include normalisation theory (functional, multi-valued and join dependency, normal forms, decomposition and synthesis methods), entityrelationship approach and SQL tuning (performance evaluation, execution plan verification, indexing, de-normalization, code level and transactions tuning). The syllabus optionally includes selected topics in the technologies, design and performance tuning of non-relational database applications (for instance, network and hierarchical models and nested relational model for an historical perspective, as well as XML and NoSQL systems for a modern perspective).",
