    "description": "This module explores how contemporary Japanese language and its use reflects Japanese society and culture. The issues and themes to be focused on vary each semester, but they include, for example, the use of communication strategies in contemporary Japanese, societal hierarchy and language, the relationships between gender and language use, and Japanese socio-cultural values as reflected in language. The approach of this module is multi-disciplinary in that the insights will be drawn from Linguistics, Sociology, Anthropology, Literature, Psychology and Media Studies as necessary. Students taking this module will conduct research projects in which literature and data are collected and analysed to be written up as a report in English. Use of the Internet to communicate with students doing similar projects in universities abroad will also be explored.",
