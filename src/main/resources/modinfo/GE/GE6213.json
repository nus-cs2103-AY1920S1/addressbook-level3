    "description": "This module is intended for students pursuing post-graduate tourism research. It uses a geographical lens to explore the tourism phenomenon, examining how spaces are shaped from various human and physical perspectives, as well as discussing the consumption of such landscapes within particular social relations. In the critical investigation of planned and spontaneous landscapes, not only will the production of consumptive spaces of tourism be evaluated but the capacity for reflexivity in consumption will also be emphasized. In this way, the concept of sustainable tourism can be evaluated. The module is structured around seminars, including a departmental seminar by the students.",
