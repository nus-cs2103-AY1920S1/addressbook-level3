== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 3

=== Overview

Alfred is a desktop application used for organizing hackathons. This project was morphed from `SE-EDU Addressbook - Level 3`, which you can find the link https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[here]. This application allows the user to easily manage the relationships between teams and participants/mentors taking part in an hackathon event along with providing a simple mechanism for judging and scoring of teams. It is written in Java with more than 25 kLoC.

This is what our project looks like:

I implemented the `import` and `export` features for *Alfred*. The following sections will delve deeper into the enhancements I have made along with the relevant documentations I have added to the user and developer guides.

Note the following format used in this document:

| `Words in this form` | Indicates that this word(s) is either associated with written code, parameters for commands, or Java classes.
| Words in `UPPER_CASE` | Indicates a parameter that you need to supply for a command.
| Words in `{braces}` | Indicates parameters for a command that you can select from. +
i.e. {A/B/C} indicates that you may either choose A, B, or C.
| Words in `[brackets]` | Indicate parameters that are optional for the command. +
i.e. `add [param]` indicates that both `add` and `add param` commands will work.
| `Entity` | Refers to a collective set of Participants, Mentors, and Teams.

==== Summary of contributions

*Major Enhancement 1:* added the ability to bulk register entities into *Alfred* through CSV files.

* *What it does:* Allows the user to add multiple entities into *Alfred* at once instead of one command at a time.
* *Justification:* This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to keep track of registered entities in CSV files and mass import it after registration period.
* *Highlights:* This enhancement requires the user to keep a correctly formatted CSV file for this command to work properly. Rules for formatting is included in our <<../UserGuide.adoc#ParameterConstraints, user guide>>.

*Major Enhancement 2:* added the ability to export all the data in *Alfred* to an external CSV file.

* *What it does:* Allows the user to keep a record of past hackathon events via a one-line command.
* *Justification:* For big events such as hackathons, it will be important to keep a record of each hackathon event. This documentation can be used for many purposes, including sharing aggregate data with other organizations and analyzing past events to predict necessary investments for future events.
* *Highlights:* The user can choose to export data regarding a certain entity type by specifying it in the command. This may be useful if the user wants to run statistical analysis regarding a specific entity type.

*Minor enhancement:* morphed existing `add`, `delete`, and `edit` commands to fit the class structure of *Alfred*

* *Highlights:* Although this is included as a minor enhancement, it required creation of 12 new Java classes along with syncing of new methods exposed by our new manager class.

==== Contributions to the User Guide

The following block shows an excerpt from our <<../UserGuide.adoc#ParameterConstraints, user guide>> showing my contributions to the documentation of various constraints of parameters used in our application. It is basically like a glossary of parameters to be used in *Alfred* commands.

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=ParameterConstraints]

'''

From here on, I included an excerpt of my contributions to the documentation of the usage of `ImportCommand` and `ExportCommand` in our user guide.

'''

==== Bulk Registration: `import fp/PATH_TO_CSV_FILE [fp/PATH_TO_ERROR_FILE]`

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=ImportExportA]

==== Export Data: `export [{mentor/participant/team}] [fp/DESIRED_CSV_FILE_PATH]`

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=ImportExportB]

==== Contributions to the Developer Guide

The following block shows an excerpt from our <<../DeveloperGuide.adoc#BulkRegistration, developer guide>> showing my contributions to the documentation of how the `ImportCommand` was implemented.

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=ImportExportA]
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=ImportExportB]

'''

Now that the structure and flow is explained, I will show the use cases of the feature in the following section.
