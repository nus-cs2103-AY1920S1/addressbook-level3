    "description": "This course proposes to look at the various 'culture areas' or 'fields of ethnological study' that anthropologists have traditionally identified in Asia, examining specific ideas, theoretical and methodological issues that have emerged in these different regions; how have certain theoretical ideas shaped research in the different parts of the region? Have they facilitated exchanges of ideas and developments of theories within the broader discipline and in interdisciplinary research? How much does place, particularly our place in Asia, affect anthropological research and our understanding of theoretical issues that have become urgent in the contemporary world?",
