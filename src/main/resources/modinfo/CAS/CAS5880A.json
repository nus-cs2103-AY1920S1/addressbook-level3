    "description": "This module explores historical and contemporary interconnections in Asia through scholarship\u2019s use of comparative methods. Spanning across Asia, case studies are examined to understand the nature of regional interaction and how comparative approaches have been applied by scholars towards that project. Anchored by a range of seminal works, the module opens up broader discussions about the ways in which we compare our subjects including polities, religious traditions and cultural practices. As a result, this module seeks to re\u2010evaluate comparison and intellectual interconnections across \u2018Asia\u2019 on a theoretical and methodological level.",
