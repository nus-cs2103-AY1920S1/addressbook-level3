    "description": "Human beings imagine wars before (as well as after) they fight them. Generals train their soldiers for future imagined conflicts, and engineers create new weapons. Artists of different kinds represent how they believe wars have been fought, and offer visions of how they will or should be fought in future. Political leaders imagine wars when deciding to launch them. This module studies the imagination of war at different times and in different cultures through case studies approached from a number of perspectives. It asks whether and how the imagination of wars might influence decisions about their declaration and conduct.",
