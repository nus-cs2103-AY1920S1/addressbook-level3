    "description": "This module provides an overview of the diversity of fungi which include the mushrooms, yeasts, molds, rusts, and toadtsools. Fungal symbionts such as lichens and mycorrhizae are also covered. Fungi are one of the four main eukaryotes on Earth (the other three being animals, plants and protists). Without fungi, decomposition and nutrient recycling will be severely impacted. Almost all land plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi which help the living plants absorb scant minerals such as phosphates and nitrates and to protect the hosts from diseases. Fungi are exploited for food, medicine, bioremediation and biotechnology. Economic losses from fungal infections will be explored.",
