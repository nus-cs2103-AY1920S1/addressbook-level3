== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event more efficiently
and in an organized fashion. Currently, organising a Hackathon is no mean feat, as it requires coordinating
across different stakeholders and managing different sources of data (such as participant and mentor information).
Instead of managing this process across different media such as Excel spreadsheets and emails, Alfred allows
you to coordinate everything in a single, convenient-to-use platform.

Alfred is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This means that users are expected
to interact with Alfred mainly through the Command Line, but each command executed will invoke a visual response
in Alfred.

Any help on the development of Alfred would be greatly appreciated,
and there are a couple of ways for you to do so
- Contribute to Alfred's codebase by expanding its features
- Improve test coverage
- Propose and implement improvements to current features.

This guide seeks to not only kick-start your journey as a contributor to Alfred by quickly getting you
up to speed with how Alfred's codebase and inner workings function, but also hopes to serve as
a useful reference to current contributors in times or confusion or when faced with difficulties.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
Alfred was designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in mind, with a focus on respecting
the SOLID principles. This section serves to give a description of the major components in the architecture
of Alfred. Subsequent sections will provide a lot more information on the inner workings of individual components
and how different components interact with each other for Alfred's various features.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component

[NOTE]
UI image and description to be updated with the later milestones.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Looks at the prefix commandType given in the CommandResult(returned after every Command is executed), as displays the specific EntityListPanel respectively.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
[NOTE]
Logic Architecture image and description to be updated with the later milestones.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AlfredParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This can result in one of two possibilities:
* a new `CommandAllocator` object is created to allocate the user input to appropriate entity-specific `Parser`. The `CommandAllocator` 's `allocate` method then returns a new Command object which is executed by the LogicManager, or
* the appropriate `Parser` is directly called if no specifying is required and returns a new  `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a participant or deleting a team).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete participant P-1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteParticipantCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandAllocator` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the lists of our various entities.
* Model is the bridge between Logic and Storage and provides an abstraction of how the data is stored in memory.
* It exposes a `ReadableEntityList` which only has the list method to remind Logic that the data given should not be modified.
* The UI can be bound to these lists so that it automatically updates when the contents of the list change.
* At the heart of the model are observable lists which allow for the dynamic updating of the UI.
* The `Model` interface also serves as an API through which controller can edit the data stored in memory.

`ModelManager`
* ModelManager implements all the methods exposed by the Model Interface. At its heart, it only contains 3 `EntityLists`
, 3 `FilteredLists` and a `UserPrefs` Object and does all the validation logic needed for the application

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The Storage component handles the complexities of storing to and reading from disc the Alfred's data.
The Storage component transforms the AB3 implementation to support the storage of Alfred's 3
main EntityLists (ParticipantList, MentorList and TeamList) as well as User Preferences. The 3 EntityLists are the main data objects
in Alfred, and Storage's purpose is to transform each of the EntityLists into a format that is JSON-Serializable
and store the data for each EntityList in separate JSON files. Storage also saves the User Preferences in a JSON file.

[NOTE]
The Food- and Swag-related features scheduled for release in v2.0, will require some changes in Storage to be made.
To be more specific, Storage would need to be updated to support the storage of these other essential data, above and beyond the
current support for the storage of the EntityLists.

==== Purpose and Usage of Storage Component
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::AlfredStorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AlfredStorage.java[`AlfredStorage.java`]

The `Storage` component saves and reads 4 different data types:

1. `UserPrefs`: User Preferences for Alfred (such as the last used Window Size of the application)
2. `ParticipantList`: Information of all the Participants in Alfred
3. `MentorList`: Information of all the Mentors in Alfred
4. `TeamList`: Information of all the Teams in Alfred

All 4 data types are stored to disc in JSON files. The data is read from the JSON files when Alfred is first
start up. It is also important to note that saving is automatic in Alfred. This means that after the execution of each
command, the data in Alfred will automatically be saved to disk. This frees the user from constantly calling
some form of saving functionality, and ensures that the information is storage is as up-to-date as possible.

[NOTE]
When reading the JSON files from memory at application start-up, any kind of data corruption in the JSON files
will cause Alfred to completely discard the file and re-initialise the data type. If there are missing fields
in the JSON file, invalid values in the individual fields or any kind of error while reading the data from the JSON
file, Alfred will re-initialise the data type with an empty data type, persisting this newly initialised data type object
to disc.

==== Interacting with the Storage Component

The Storage Component uses the Facade Design Pattern, and exposes the functionality of all the Storage classes
to the Model Component solely through the AlfredStorage interface. The exposed functionality was deliberately kept
simple, allowing the following methods for each of the 4 data types:

    1. `getFilePath()`: Retrieves the location of the JSON file
    2. `save()`: saves the data to the JSON file
    3. `read()`: reads the data from the JSON file

*  The Storage component handles the complexities of actually storing to and reading from disc the different data types.

As can be seen in the figure at the start of this section, underlying AlfredStorage's simple interface are several classes
that ensure the accurate storing and retrieval of Alfred's data from disc. The following are some details of the Storage
Component:

* Each EntityList has a designated Storage class (i.e. for Participant, you have `ParticipantListStorage`, `JsonParticipantListStorage` etc.). Hence, for the rest of this explanation, Entity will be used as a generic term for Participants/Mentors/Teams.
* The class implementing the `EntityListStorage` interface is `JsonTeamEntityStorage`. This class is responsible for providing the read/save functionality for the entire EntityList to `AlfredStorageManager`.
* In order to save the entire `EntityList` in JSON, the class `JsonSerializableEntityList` implements the logic for serialization for the collection of Entities (i.e. EntityList). This is achieved by converting the `EntityList` to a `List<JsonAdaptedEntity>`.
* In order to save each individual Entity, the Entity is in turn converted to a `JsonAdaptedEntity` object. The `JsonAdaptedEntity` class contains the fields of each Entity that are relevant for saving to disc. Hence, this class is directly serialized into JSON, and also has methods for converting the serialized object back into an Entity object for `AlfredStorage` to return to `ModelManager`.
* The conversion of the `JsonAdaptedEntity` object to fields in a JSON file is done by Java's Jackson library.

The following is a concrete example of the storage of a ParticipantList in JSON:

.Structure of the JSON File for ParticipantList
image::ParticipantListJson.png[]

Figure 10 shows the contents of the JSON file storing a ParticipantList containing 2 participants. The data in the red box
corresponds to the fields in a single Participant object. These fields are generated by the Jackson library from the serializable `JsonAdaptedParticipant`
object, and the entire list of participants in the JSON file is in turn generated because the `JsonSerializableParticipantList` class converts
the ParticipantList to a List of `JsonAdaptedParticipant`.

==== Design Considerations

1. Data Integrity

* The individual `JsonAdaptedEntity` classes perform validation on every field in the JSON file for each Entity as
it attempts to convert the JSON data into an Entity in Alfred. Should the data prove to be invalid, an error is thrown
upwards to ModelManager and a new EntityList is initialised in memory, effectively discarding the old EntityList.
* This design was to ensure that any form of tampering of the code, malicious or inadvertent, will not result in data
inconsistencies in Alfred.
* In future implementations, it would be best to ensure that the JSON file is encrypted and secured to minimise
opportunities for tampering with the data.


[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how the major features in Alfred are implemented.

=== Undo/Redo feature

The Undo/Redo feature, as the name suggests, allows you to undo and redo commands. Only commands that alter the state of the data
in Alfred can be undone/redone. The state of the 3 EntityLists (ParticipantList, MentorList and TeamList) is tracked across the execution
of different commands, and the state can be recovered through the use of the undo/redo feature. The last used IDs for each of the 3 EntityLists
are also saved.

The feature has been updated in v1.4 to support multiple undos/redos. This means that invoking `undo N`/`redo N` on Alfred, where `N`
is an integer, allows you to undo/redo `N` commands at one go.

To undo/redo to next immediate command, simply invoking `undo`/`redo` on Alfred would suffice, as it implicitly calls `undo 1`/`redo 1`
in the code.

This feature is a convenient feature as it allows users of Alfred to quickly correct and recover
from mistakes, greatly increasing the utility of the application.

[NOTE]
Only the 50 data states is stored in `ModelHistoryManager` at any one point in time. The addition of any more data states will
result in the discarding of the oldest data state.

==== Implementation

The general idea is as follows: The undo/redo mechanism is mainly facilitated by `ModelHistoryManager`. Alfred's data is held in memory within the `ModelManager` object. After the execution of commands that mutate the data in Alfred, a deep copy
of all 3 EntityLists is made and saved as a `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager`. A deep copy is necessary to ensure that
any subsequent changes to data will not alter the data in the `ModelHistoryRecord`, allowing each `ModelHistoryRecord` to serve as
a pristine record of the state of the data in Alfred at the end of the execution of each command.

Whenever the `undo` command is invoked, `ModelHistoryManager` returns a `ModelHistoryRecord`.
A deep copy of the EntityLists contained within `ModelHistoryRecord` are then used to replace the EntityLists in the `ModelManager` for its operations, effectively
reverting the data in Alfred to a previous state.

[NOTE]
The data in each `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager` is stored in memory, and is not stored on disc, so it will
persist only while the Alfred application is running.

==== Implementation: How `ModelHistoryManager` Keeps Track of the State of the Data in Alfred
The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of method calls used to store the state of the data in
Alfred in `ModelHistory` (`ModelHistoryManager` is an implementation of the `ModelHistory` interface) after
the execution of a DeleteParticipantCommand:

.Sequence Diagram for the Updating of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoSequenceDiagramUpdateHistory.png[]

The top half of the diagram covers the creation of the DeleteParticipantCommand object, and the bottom half covers
what happens when the `execute()` method of the DeleteParticipantCommand object is called. The important thing to note is the fact
that a deep copy of the 3 EntityLists is created and stored in ModelHistoryRecord.

An important issue to take note of is that only commands that implement the TrackableState interface will cause a new `ModelHistoryRecord`
to be created and stored in `ModelHistoryManager`. The TrackableState interface is a marker interface, and is used to mark
the commands that mutate data in Alfred.

==== Implementation: How `ModelManager` is Updated When the Undo Command is Executed
The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the UndoCommand is executed.

.Sequence Diagram for the Execution of the Undo Command
image::UndoSequenceDiagramExecutionofUndo.png[]

The important issue to take note of here is that the code first checks whether it is valid to undo to a certain state by
calling the `canUndo()` method in `ModelHistory`. The implementation of `ModelHistory` in `ModelHistoryManager` does so by checking
if there are sufficient states to undo to, otherwise an exception is thrown.

[NOTE]
A analogous process is executed for the Redo Command.

==== Behaviour of Undo/Redo Mechanism
`ModelHistoryMangager` contains a List of `ModelHistoryRecord`, and a pointer pointing to the `ModelHistoryRecord` that
reflects the current state of the data in Alfred.

In order to better illustrate how the state of the data is tracked and stored in `ModelHistoryManager`, consider the following example.
The following commands are executed:
1. AddParticipantCommand: `add participant n/Clark Kent p/+6598321212 e/clark.kent@supermail.com`
2. AddMentorCommand: `add mentor n/Lex Luthor o/LexCorp p/+6598321010 e/lex.not.evil@gmail.com s/Social`
3. ListParticipantCommand: `list participants`
4. UndoCommand: `undo 2`
5. AddTeamCommand: `add team n/Justice League s/Social pn/BetterThanAvengers l/12`

This is the state of `ModelHistoryManager` when Alfred is first started.

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState0.png[]


This is what happens after each step:

__ Step 1. AddParticipantCommand: `add participant n/Clark Kent p/+6598321212 e/clark.kent@supermail.com` __

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

A new `ModelHistoryRecord` is created to reflect the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of the AddParticipantCommand.

__ Step 2. AddMentorCommand: `add mentor n/Lex Luthor o/LexCorp p/+6598321010 e/lex.not.evil@gmail.com s/Social` __

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

A new `ModelHistoryRecord` is created to reflect the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of the AddMentorCommand.

__ Step 3. ListParticipantCommand: `list participants` __

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

Note that no new `ModelHistoryRecord` is created because the ListParticipantCommand does not alter the state of the data in Alfred.
Hence, it does not implement the TrackableState interface.

__ Step 4. UndoCommand: `undo 2` __

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

After executing the `undo 2` command, the pointer in `ModelHistoryManager` shifts backwards by 2 to point tp the `ModelHistoryRecord`
at the zero-th index.

Note that this means that `undo 3` would throw an error, as you cannot move beyond the very first `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager`.

__ Step 5. AddTeamCommand: `add team n/Justice League s/Social pn/BetterThanAvengers l/12` __

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

Note that the execution of a new command will invalidate the `ModelHistoryRecord` after the pointer. This is because all subsequent
data states are the result of transformations that have already been undone, so it is not valid to be able to `redo` to them.

==== Design Considerations
When designing the undo/redo feature, there were some design considerations to take note of.

===== Aspect: How Undo/Redo Executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire data state of Alfred in memory.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

Given the large number of commands that are available in Alfred, it is not very scalable to implement
an undo/redo method for each of the commands. It is also more extensible to use Alternative 1 as it allows
future commands to be added without the need for further changes for the undo/redo feature - simply get the new
command's class to implement the TrackableState interface if it alters the state of the data in Alfred.

===== Aspect: Use of Marker Interface
Allows for an easy way to determine if the state of the data should be saved after the execution of the command.
It is also very easy to change in the codebase. This means that should a feature in the future alter the state of the
data in Alfred after execution, it is trivial to allow `ModelHistoryManager` to track the state.

===== Aspect: Limitation of Number of Data States Stored
Given that the Undo/Redo feature saves the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of TrackableState commands,
it is important to ensure that memory usage by `ModelHistoryManager` is limited, otherwise Alfred will run very slowly and
potentially crash once a substantial number of commands have been executed.

In order to accommodate this design for the Undo/Redo feature, we decided to limit the number of `ModelHistoryRecord` stored in
`ModelHistoryManager` to 50. It is unlikely that a user would want to undo more than 50 commands at a go, as that would indicate
a very significant error in the workflow, and recovering from that should not have a reliance on the Undo/Redo feature.

=== Command History Navigation
Since Alfred is ultimately a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application, it would be good to integrate some of the more useful features
of CLI applications into Alfred. This feature allows users to go through previously executed commands by pressing the ALT+UP/DOWN
arrow keys. Although it would be more convenient to use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to navigate the command history, the UP/DOWN arrow
keys have been mapped to other uses in Alfred.

This feature allows users to quickly re-use previously exeuted commands without having to go through the hassle of re-typing
everything. This is particularly useful when the commands are long, and only small modifications are necessary to the command.

[NOTE]
Only successfully executed commands can be navigated to using the ALT+UP/DOWN keys. Invalid comands will not be stored, and hence
cannot be accessed using this feature.

==== Implementation
Every time a valid new command is executed, the string used to generate the command (i.e. the text that the user types into
Alfred's Command Input Box) is stored in the `Command` object.

The main class resposible for remembering and providing the previously used command input strings is the `CommandHistoryManager` class,
which implements the `CommandHistory` interface. The `CommandHistory` interface only exposes 3 methods: `saveCommandExecutionString`,
`getPrevCommandString` and `getNextCommandString`. The latter 2 methods directly map to the 2 situations of pressing the ALT+UP and
pressing the ALT+DOWN keys respectively.

When the `Command` object is executed, that string is then stored in the `CommandHistoryManager`. A linear list of successfully
executed commands' input strings is stored in `CommandHistoryManager`, and a pointer to the current string being displayed in the textbox
is used to indicate which is the currently active string.

[NOTE]
Only the last 50 commands are stored in `CommandHistoryManager`. Anything beyond that is discarded.

==== Implementation: Setting and Storing of Command Input String
The following sequence diagram describes the sequence of method calls used to set and store the command input string in
`CommandHistoryManager`

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::CommandHistoryNavigationSettingofCommandString.png[]

==== Implementation: Arrow Key Invocation
The following sequence diagram describes the sequence of method calls used to set the text in Alfred's Command Input Box
whenever the ALT + UP/DOWN arrow keys are pressed.

.Sequence Diagram for when ALT+UP arrow keys are pressed
image::CommandHistoryNavigationArrowKeyInvocation.png[]

An analogous process is executed when the ALT+DOWN arrow keys are pressed.

==== Design Considerations
The following are some design considerations for the Command History Navigation feature.

===== Aspect: Limitation of Command History Size
In order to ensure that `CommandHistoryManager` does not occupy an increasingly large portion of memory as more and more
commands are executed, it is necessary to limit the number of commands that are stored. Otherwise, Alfred's performance
will suffer as more commands are executed.

==== Aspect: Usage of Arrow Keys
Most CLI applications with such a Command History Navigation feature would use the UP/DOWN arrow keys directly, but the UP/DOWN
arrow keys have been mapped for a different use in Alfred. Hence, we decided to use the ALT modifier key for the feature. It is
an inconvenience, but likely a minor one.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Non Functional Requirements

.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
.  The system should not seem sluggish if it contains less than 1500 entities.
.  Project is not intended for use on mobile and only should be used on desktop.
.  The application assumes that the user is comfortable with the concept of the command line.
.  The application is meant to run offline.
.  The application is largely a personnel/HR manager, and is not expected to do anything more than that (eg hackathon finances etc).
.  The application is to be used for a single hackathon only and not for multiple hackathons.
.  The application assumes that the hackathon is a short term affair (no longer than 4 days).
.  The application assumes that this is an English medium hackathon and that no non-English names are expected.
.  The GUI should display the result of commands in an intuitive, organized manner that is readable by the laymen(as part of the organization/ affordability of the application).

== Product Survey

*Google Sheets*

Author: Google

Pros:

* This is extremely versatile as Google Sheets come with a list of extremely helpful macros that could help in the storage of participants.
* The display and UI of Google Sheets is extremely intuitive and will come as second nature to anyone using the web.
* Convenient and accessible by multiple HR personnel simultaneously.

Cons:

* Google Sheets has no concept of objects and thus it cannot accurately depict the relationships between our different entities.
* As above, it is hard to look for relationships between our entities, such as Team/Participant associations.
* Google Sheets may be useful for storing information, but it does not support command line arguments.
* Google Sheets is also unable to perform input validation as it lacks the logic to do so.


[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum. +
   _Note: If you are a OS X user, you might need to run this from your command line instead._

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

_{ more test cases ... }_

=== Deleting a Participant

. Deleting a Participant while all participants are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all participants using the `list participants` command. Multiple participants in the list.
.. Test case: `delete participant P-1` +
   Expected: Participant with id P-1. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete participant P-101212323` +
   Expected: No participant is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.


=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Prerequisites: Create a JSON with corrupted data, or any data at all
.. Test case: Start the application. Logger should  kindly inform you that the storage files
are corrupted and hence it defaults to using empty lists.
