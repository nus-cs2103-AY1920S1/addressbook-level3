== PROJECT: Seller Manager Lite (SML)

== Overview

Seller Manager Lite (SML) is a desktop application used for handphone resellers to manage their customers, phones, orders and schedules.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *GUI to display schedules in a calendar.*
** What it does: This feature allows our users to view thier schedules graphically, as well as navigate around the panel after adding/editing/deleting schedules.
** Justification: This feature is a critical addition for sellers who have numerous schedules planned throughout the week. Without a visual representation of a calendar, it would be extremely non-user-friendly as sellers would have to check through their list of schedules and the timings one by one.
** Highlights: I designed a panel class to contain the third-party library for rendering events as a calendar. The class acts as a wrapper around the calendar and contains the logic for controlling the calendar.
To make the application more user friendly, the application automatically switches to the calendar panel when any schedule commands are executed. This is to provide users a visual confirmation of the results of their command.
** Credits: Used _JFXtras_ for Calendar Panel to render schedules visually.
** Integrated library in PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-4/main/pull/105[#105]
