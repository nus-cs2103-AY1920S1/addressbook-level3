    "description": "In terms of health systems, Singapore consistently tops rankings for its efficiency and efficacy. What exactly is a health system? Why is it important that we know how health systems operate? This module aims to provide students with an introductory overview of health systems and policies, that have the ability to shape an individual's and the population's wellbeing. Singapore's healthcare system is used as case study to explain the organization of health systems and the policy responses to public health challenges that arise within the context of these systems.",
