    "description": "This module examines the relation between literature and the expression of individual identity. Since classical times, western literature has been centrally concerned with the various ways in which individuals negotiate with social, political, cultural, and personal constraints. And these constraining conditions often correspond to an aspect of a central protagonist's identity: Oedipus sets out to learn why his city is destroyed by a plague; to his horror, he discovers that he is to blame. This module looks at some of the ways in which fictional characters confront the various oppressive constraints that express different aspects of social and individual identity",
