=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor, parses user input.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add-member mn/Abhi`.

.Component interactions for `add-member mn/Abhi` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.
//end::architecture[]

//tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

==== Overview
The `UI` consists of the `MainWindow` that is made up of static and non-static parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

[NOTE]
The non-static `Ui` component, `UserViewMain` is responsive to user commands. Its functionality will be
further explained using a separate diagram.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

==== Functionality of `UserViewMain`

`UserViewMain` is the component responsible for switching the user view. As it fetches data from `Logic`, it is associated
with `Logic`, hence Figure 5 below shows an association between `UserViewMain` and `Logic`. The controller class of `UserViewMain` is `UserViewController`. +
`UserViewController` and `UserViewNavigator` both contain references to the various `UiPart` views offered in +Work in order to switch between them successfully. +

The diagram below shows how `UserViewMain` integrates with `Logic`, `Model` and `UiPart`.

.UserViewMain integration with UI component
image::UserViewMainClassDiagram.png[]

Below is a guide to how `UserViewMain` switches the users view.

Step 1: User enters a command.

Step 2: `UserViewUpdate` parses said command and interacts with `UserViewMain` to display the requested layout.

Step 3: `UserViewMain` interacts with `UserViewNavigator`, which obtains the
relevant data from `Logic`, to create the relevant `UiPart`. These `UiPart` components are the `MemberListPanel`,
`ProjectDashBoardView` etc.

[NOTE]
The non-static `UiPart` components are stored in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/ui/views[`views`] folder.

Step 4: This component is then passed to `UserViewController` to set the current view of
`UserViewMain` component.

Step 5: Users view is then switched successfully.



The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Parses and executes user commands to show user the right view using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
//end::ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ProjectDashboardParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// tag::ModelDevGuide[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramNew.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes the unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>`, `ObservableList<Task>`, `ObservableList<Inventory>` and `ObservableList<Mapping>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Project Dashboard`, which `Member` or 'Task' can reference. This would allow `Project Dashboard` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Member` or 'Task' needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagramNew.png[]
// end::ModelDevGuide[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The Storage component serves the following purposes.

** It can save UserPref objects in json format and read it back.
** It can save the +Work data in json format and read it back.
** It can also save the user settings in json format and read it back.


.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/pluswork/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]


[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.pluswork.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== [Proposed] Calendar feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The commands introduced by this feature include; `generate-timings`, `ics` import and commands.
The commands are facilitated by `ProjectCalendar`. The various `ics` files of the members are parsed in this component.

* `ProjectCalendar#generateTimings()` -- Generates the free times after on syncing `ics` calendars of members.
* `ProjectCalendar#getAvailableTimings()` -- Retrieves the available timings of members.
* `ProjectCalendar#importCalendar()` -- Import the member's calendar.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#generateTimings()`, `Model#getAvailableTimings()` and
`Model#importCalendar()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the various commands work.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `ProjectCalendar` will be initialised based on the
saved `ProjectCalendar`.

Step 2. The user imports members' calendars by executing `import-calendar`.

Step 3. The user executes `generate-timings` command.

Step 4. +Work displays available meeting times for the project members.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Importing and storing calendars of users

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User specifies file path of `ics` file in command line.
** Pros: Easier to implement, files can be stored in application.
** Cons: User must enter file path, which is error prone.
* **Alternative 2:** Upon execution of `import-calendar` a file chooser pops up to allow user to browse and upload file.
** Pros: User can use UI to upload instead.
** Cons: Due to constraints of application, a ui based upload may not be feasible (Possibly in v2.0)

===== Aspect: Flexibility in syncing calendars

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** +Work syncs all calendars uploaded when `generate-timings` is executed
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: User may be finding a suitable time for an event where only specific members are required, in which case timings
may not help as much.
* **Alternative 2:** User can specify which members calendars to sync
** Pros: User can find more suitable timings for events which involve only specific members.
** Cons: Association between members and their respective calendars must be rigorously tested to ensure accuracy of timings.
May introduce complexity into storage and dependencies among components.


//tag::dashboard[]
=== Dashboard feature
==== Implementation

This feature was implemented to allow users to view the status of the tasks in their project, upcoming deadlines and upcoming meetings
at a glance.

The command introduced by this feature is `home` and displays data affected by `Task` and `Meeting` commands such as `add-task`, `edit-task`
and `add-meeting`.
The commands are facilitated by `ProjectDasboard`. This component resides in `Model` and contains the in-memory data of the application which is
retrieved when the user switches to `Home`.

* `ProjectDashboard#getTasksNotStarted()` -- Retrieves the current list of tasks with status `unbegun` in +Work.
* `ProjectDashboard#getTasksDoing()` -- Retrieves the current list of tasks with status `doing` in +Work.
* `ProjectDashboard#getTasksDone()` -- Retrieves the current list of tasks with status `done` in +Work.
* `ProjectDashboard#getTasksByDeadline()` -- Retrieves the current list of tasks with nearing deadlines in +Work.
* `ProjectDashboard#getMeetingList()` -- Retrieves the current list of meetings in +Work.
* `ProjectDashboard#splitTaksByStatus()` -- Processes the current list of tasks and stores the tasks by status.
* `ProjectDashboard#splitTaksByDeadline()` -- Processes the current list of tasks and stores the tasks based on nearing deadlines.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredTasksNotStarted()`, `Model#getFilteredTasksDoing()`,
`Model#getFilteredTasksDone()`, `Model#getFilteredTasksByDeadline()` and `Model#getFilteredMeetingList()`.

[NOTE]

To allow `Ui` to be responsive to updates in the settings, all of the operations are similarly exposed in the `Logic` interface
`Logic#getFilteredTasksNotStarted()`, `Logic#getFilteredTasksDoing()`,
`Logic#getFilteredTasksDone()`, `Logic#getFilteredTasksByDeadline()` and `Logic#getFilteredMeetingList()`.

Step 1. The user executes the `home` command.

Step 2. `Logic` executes `Logic#getFilteredTasksNotStarted()`, `Logic#getFilteredTasksDoing()`,
`Logic#getFilteredTasksDone()`, `Logic#getFilteredTasksByDeadline()` and `Logic#getFilteredMeetingList()`.

Step 3. This calls `Model#getFilteredTasksNotStarted()`, `Model#getFilteredTasksDoing()`, `Model#getFilteredTasksDone()`, `Model#getFilteredTasksByDeadline()`.

Step 4. This executes `ProjectDashboard#splitTasksByStatus()`, to populate `tasksNotStarted`, `tasksDoing` and `tasksDone`. +
Similarly, `ProjectDashBoard#splitTasksByDeadline()` is called to populate `tasksByDeadline`.

Step 5. The various `FilteredList` objects are updated, since their backing lists are stored in `ProjectDashboard`. (refer to Figure 9)

The object diagram below shows a snapshot of the various objects involved when the user views the dashboard.

[NOTE]
The diagram omits objects involving the `Ui` component as well as specific `Task` objects for brevity.

.Snapshot of objects involved in populating the dashboard with data
image::DashboardObjectDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

This section explores how the design of the dashboard can affect it's responsiveness and integration with other data in the application.

===== Aspect: Data structure used to store `Task` objects.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All tasks are stored in a single `UniqueTaskList` in `ProjectDashboard` with `TaskStatus` attribute.
When the user enters `home` to view the dashboard, the tasks are split by `TaskStatus` and deadline in `ProjectDashboard` and dispatched to the `Ui`.
** Pros: Easier to implement in terms of storage and retrieval. By storing only one list and splitting the tasks in memory there is less data saved.
** Cons: The constant processing of task data may tax the memory of the application, as it is storing the same tasks in multiple data structures. This may affect performance
for large number of tasks.
* **Alternative 2:** The `Task` objects will only contain attributes which are not filtered in the dashboard. They can be stored in a `HashMap` as values and the keys are filtered attributes such as `TaskStatus` and deadline.
** Pros: Memory usage of _Work is more efficient, as `ProjectDashboard` does not have to store multiple references of the same `Task` objects in memory. Also, due to the mappings between `TaskStatus` and the `Task` assigned those statuses, they can be retrieved and displayed more efficiently.
** Cons: Due to the requirements of +Work, `Task` objects are coupled to `Member` and `Inventory`. The method of storing these tasks, other components would have to
iterate through all keys to obtain all the `Task` objects and manipulate their mappings. This would render the `HashMap` useless.

We decided to opt for design option one so as to enable `Task` to integrate with other components of +Work in the most efficient way possible. Although design option two would
benefit the dashboard greatly it would cause almost all other components and views to become inefficient.
//end::dashboard[]

//tag::settings[]
=== Settings feature
==== Implementation

This feature was implemented to allow users to customise their experience when using +Work.

The commands introduced by this feature include; `theme light`, `theme dark`, `clock twenty_four` and `clock twelve`.
The commands are facilitated by `UserSettings`. This component resides in `Model` and contains the customisable settings available to
the user, which are currently the `theme` and `clockFormat`.

* `UserSettings#getTheme()` -- Retrieves the current theme applied to +Work.
* `UserSettings#getClockFormat()` -- Retrieves the current clock format applied to +Work.
* `UserSettings#setTheme(Theme newTheme)` -- Sets the default theme of +Work to be `newTheme`
* `UserSettings#setClockFormat(ClockFormat newClockFormat)` -- Sets the default clock format of +Work to be `newClockFormat`

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getCurrentTheme()`, `Model#getCurrentClockFormat()`,
`Model#setCurrentTheme(Theme newTheme)`, `Model#setClockFormat(ClockFormat newClockFormat)` respectively.

[NOTE]

To allow `Ui` to be responsive to updates in the settings, two of the operations are similarly exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#getTheme()` and
`Logic#getClockFormat()`.

The activity diagram below summarises the process of executing a settings command.

.Activity diagram of settings command execution.
image::SettingsActivityDiagram.png[]

Assume that the current `theme` is `LIGHT` and `clockFormat` is `TWENTY_FOUR`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the various commands work:

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `UserSettings` will be initialised by `Model` based on the
saved `UserSettings`.

Step 2. The user executes `theme dark` command.

Step 3. `Logic#execute()` calls `Model#setDarkTheme()`, which calls `UserSettings#setDarkTheme()`.
This changes the `theme` attribute in `UserSettings` to `DARK`.

Step 4. `DARK` theme has been applied to +Work and `Ui` is updated.

Step 5. The settings have been updated and stored in `plusworksettings.json`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `theme dark` operation works with reference to steps 2 and 3 above.

.Operational flow of `ThemeCommand`
image::ThemeSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ThemeCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `theme light` operation is similar to the one shown in figure above. However, the method called is `UserSettings#setLightTheme()`.

[IMPORTANT]

The `clock twelve` and `clock twenty_four` have a similar operation to `theme dark` as well. There are two differences, `ClockCommand` replaces
`ThemeCommand` and the associated methods called in `Model` are different.

==== Design Considerations

This section explores how the design can affect the level of customisation available to the user through the settings feature in +Work.

===== Aspect: Storage of the various options in settings data

Within a specific setting stored in `Model`, each option has data that helps yield a specific behaviour. Currently the available settings are
represented as `Enum`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The relevant data is stored within the class itself. +
For example `ClockFormat` has two constants `TWENTY_FOUR` and `TWELVE` that contain `DateTimeFormatters` which are retrieved
when the user wishes to toggle between them.
** Pros: Better design as it is more modular. The data can be stored as attributes of the enum constants and retrieved via the default setting from `Model`. Furthermore if
data is to be changed, it only needs to be changed in one component for the expected behaviour to be achieved.
** Cons: User cannot customise the data directly due to the nature of `Enum` classes.
* **Alternative 2:** The data is stored in the `UserSettings` component as `static` fields.
** Pros: This exposes the data of each option fore each settings to the `Model` component. If the user requests to customise that data, it would be possible in this design.
** Cons: `UserSettings` would change whenever the data related to a particular settings option is updated. Ideadlly, `UserSettings` should only be aware of the various settings the user
is able to customise.

We decided to opt for design option one, so as to be in line with the Single Responsibility principle. This would make it easier
for future developers to extend the functionality of `UserSettings` in a more modular manner.

// end::settings[]

// tag::statistics[]
// tag::statisticsP1[]
=== Statistics feature
The Statistics feature allows users to retrieve statistics relating to members and tasks in +Work, so that users can get a
broad overview of the project's and member's project.

==== Implementation

The commands introduced by this statistics feature includes: `task-stats` and `member-stats`. These commands are facilitated by the class 'Statistics'
that resides within model. The `Statistics` class implements the following operations:

* `Statistics#doCalculations()` -- Calculates the statistics needed using existing list of tasks, members and mappings.
* `Statistics#getPortionMembersByTasks()` -- Retrieves statistics of all the members and number of tasks completed by the each individual member.
* `Statistics#getPortionMembersByItems()` -- Retrieves statistics of all the members and number of items purchased by the each individual member.
* `Statistics#getPortionTasksByStatus()` -- Retrieves statistics of all existing tasks and number of tasks of each status.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#doCalculations`, and `Model#getStatistics`.

[NOTE]

To allow the `Ui` to be responsive, one of the operations is similarly exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#getStatistics()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time. The `Statistics` object stored by ProjectDashboard is initialised based on the data previously saved.

[NOTE]

Data previously saved refers to the statistics calculation done based on list of members, tasks and mappings saved.

*Step 2.* The user executes the `task-stats` command to retrieve statistics related to the tasks in the application.

The `task-stats` command calls `Model#getFilteredTasksList()`, `Model#getFilteredMembersList()` and `Model#getFilteredMappingsList()` to obtain lists of all the members, tasks and mappings saved in the application.
Using the lists, a Statistics object is formed. `Model#setStatistics` is called to updated the statistics in ProjectDashboard.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 10) shows how the `task-stats` operation works.

image::GetStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]
Figure 10. Operational flow of `GetStatisticsCommand`

[NOTE]
The `member-stats` operation is similar to the one shown in figure 10.

Step 3. In order for task statistics to be displayed in a comprehensive manner, when the `task-stats` command is called,
`TaskStatisticsView` class is also called to display the task stats.

[NOTE]
To allow the `UI` to be responsive, `getStatistics()` is similarly exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#getStatistics()`

The following sequence diagram (Figure 11) shows how calling the `task-stats` operation leads to the comprehensive UI display of task statistics.

image::GetStatisticsUISequenceDiagram.png[]
Figure 11. Operational flow of displaying statistics in +Work
// end::statisticsP1[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `task-stats` command:

image::GetStatisticsActivityDiagram.png[]
Figure 12. Operational flow during execution of `task-stats` command

// tag::statisticsP2[]
==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of the Statistics class in +Work,
as well as the display of statistics in +Work.

===== Aspect: Implementation of Statistics class
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** One statistics object for the entire ProjectDashboard
** Pros: Easy to implement, centralised class for all statistics
** Cons: May have performance issues due to calculations involving large amounts of tasks and members.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual statistic objects for members and tasks.
** Pros: Ensures faster performance, more detailed statistics can be included
** Cons: Complicates the implementation of the statistics class, might not have enough time to implement it by v1.4

*Alternative 1* was chosen given the time constraint in implementing the features in time for +Work Version 1.4.

===== Aspect: Display of Statistics for Project Dashboard
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of displaying the calculate statistics in +Work.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a pie chart to represent information
** Pros: Increases the ease of workload comparison
** Cons: Decreases the amount of detail of individual tasks and members that are displayed
* **Alternative 2:** Use a list to represent information
** Pros: Includes more details for individual elements
** Cons: Decreases the ease of comparison between tasks and members

Because the team came to a consensus that the main objective of the Statistics feature in +Work is to provide the user with
an overview of all the project tasks and members, for ease of comparison, *Alternative 1* was chosen as it fits the purpose
more than Alternative 2 does.
// tag::statisticsP2[]
// end::statistics[]

// tag::member[]
=== Member Feature
The member feature introduces the ability for +Work to deal with project members, in the same way it deals with project tasks.
This makes +Work a more comprehensive application because project tasks and members can be kept track of together.

==== Implementation
+Work's members and their related commands are supported by a `Member` class that resides within model.
The following class diagram exposes the structure of the Member class, and shows how the different components relating to the Member class works together.

image::MemberClassDiagram.png[]
Diagram 13. Class diagram of Member package

Apart from the typical commands (`add-member`, `delete-member`, `find-member`) involved in such a central class, the member features also introduce a `set-image` command.
The `set-image` command allows users to set an image in their computer as the profile picture of a member in +Work.
To accommodate the `set-image` command, the `Member` class has an alternative constructor that takes in the image filepath as a parameter to save it as an attribute to the member object, when `set-image` command is called.
Additionally, to support the command, the `Member` class implements the following operation:

* `Member#getImagePath()` -- Retrieves the filepath of the image stored in the user's computer
* `Member#getImage()` -- Retrieves the member's image using the image filepath

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the set-image mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time, and adds a team member into +Work. The member is displayed with a default profile picture.

*Step 2.* The user executes the `set-image` command to set an image in their computer as the profile picture of a member in +Work..

The `set-image` command calls `Model#getFilteredMembersList()` to retrieve the Member that is to be edited.
A new member object is formed, with all the same parameters as the specified member object, and a new Image Filepath parameter.
`Model#setMember` is called to replace the old member object with the new one in +Work.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `set-image` operation works.

image::SetImageSequenceDiagram.png[]
Figure 14. Operational flow of `SetImageCommand`

[NOTE]
The image's file path is stored in the Member object. If the image is shifted to another location, the file path stored becomes invalid, and the user has to call the `set-image` command again, with the new file path.

*Step 3.* When an operation is called to display a member, `Member#getImage` is called to display the image using Javafx's ImageView.

The following sequence diagram shows how the image is called up and subsequently displayed in the +Work for an individual member.

image::DisplayMemberSequenceDiagram.png[]
Figure 15. Operational flow of displaying a member with his profile picture

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram only shows how a member's profile image is called up and displayed. It doesn't show how the member's
name and tags are displayed, since this is very similar to how AB3 originally displays its `Person` name and tags.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `set-image` command:

image::SetImageActivityDiagram.png[]
Figure 16. Operational flow during execution of `set-image` command

==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of the image attribute under members,
as well as the display of members in +Work.

===== Aspect: Storage of image under member
* **Alternative 1:** Storing the image filepath as a changeable attribute
** Pros: Editing a member's profile picture involves accessing the member and changing its file path attribute
** Cons: The image file path attribute is exposed to the rest of the classes in +Work and may be unintentionally edited, causing
the member's profile picture to be edited without the intention to.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Storing the image filepath as a final attribute
** Pros: Ensures the member's image filepath remains unchangeable and specific to the member
** Cons: A new member object has to be created to replace the member being edited every time the member's profile
picture is updated

*Alternative 2* was chosen to keep in line with the original structure of the Person object in AB3, with all attributes
being final and unchangeable.

===== Aspect: Display of members
* **Alternative 1:** Display each member with only its member name, ID and profile picture
** Pros: Concise display of each member in +Work, with only the essential information being exposed
** Cons: Less details of individual members are displayed, making it difficult to draw links between members and the tasks they are involved in
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Display members with its member name, ID, profile picture and tasks assigned
** Pros: Includes more details for individual members, which increases the ease in which the user can identify a member's responsibilities
** Cons: Display of members is cluttered, and may expose unnecessary information in certain situations

*Alternative 2* was chosen because it is more in line with +Work's objective of drawing easy comparison between project members and tasks.
// end::member[]

=== Inventory feature
==== Proposed Implementation

This feature was implemented to allow users to add inventories when using +Work.

The commands introduced by this feature include; `add-inv`, `delete-inv`, `edit-inv`, `list-inv`.
The commands are facilitated by UniqueInventoryList class which resides in Model.
The UniqueInventoryList class implements the following operations:


* `UniqueInventoryList #add(Inventory toAdd)` — This command adds the Inventory toAdd to the inventory list of +Work.
* `UniqueInventoryList #remove(Inventory toAdd)` —  This command removes the Inventory toAdd from the inventory list of +Work.
* `UniqueInventoryList #setInventory (Inventory target, Inventory editedInventory)` — This command replaces the target Inventory with the new editedInventory.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as
`Model#addInventory(Inventory inventory)`,
`Model#deleteInventory(Inventory target)`,
`Model#setInventory(Inventory target, Inventory editedInventory)`
respectively.


The activity diagram below summarises the process of executing an `add-inv` command.

.Activity diagram of `add-inv` command execution.
image::AddInvActivityDiagram.png[]


Given below is an example usage scenario and how add-inv command behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application. The inventories will be initiated by Model based on the inventories previously saved.

Step 2. The user executes `add-inv` command.

Step 3. `Logic#execute()` calls `Model#addInventory(Inventory inventory)`, which calls `UniqueInventoryList #add(Inventory toAdd)`. This adds the inventory to UniqueInventoryList.

Step 4. The UI will be updated to reflect the changes. This can be viewed using the `list-inv` command.

Step 5. The settings have been updated and stored in projectdashboard.json.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add-inv command works.


.Operational flow of `AddInventoryCommand`
image::AddInvSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

This section explores how the design can affect the inventory features in +Work.

===== Aspect: Storage of an inventory

Within a specific setting, each option has data that helps yield a specific behaviour. Currently the available settings are
represented as enumerations.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : Each inventory only stores the inventory name and price. The task and member attached to each inventory is stored in UniqueMappingManager.

** Pros: Better design as it is more modular. If task or member is deleted, it only needs to be changed in UniqueMappingManager for the expected behaviour to be achieved.

** Cons: Retrieving of the mappings (task and member attached) is more difficult and may result in bugs if not implemented accurately.

* **Alternative 2**: Each inventory also contains the attribute for task attached and member attached.

** Pros: Retrieving the mappings is easier and faster.

** Cons: When a task or member is deleted, all the inventories need to be checked and updated. This would be a very slow method.


===== Aspect: Display of inventories list

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: The inventories are listed without any classification and is not sorted  by any attributes.

** Pros: This would be easier to implement and maintain UI components.

** Cons: User must use the pdf method to see any statistics, making for a less user-friendly experience.

* **Alternative 2**: More statistics, classifications and sorting methods available to customize the inventories list.

** Pros: The inventories list is more user-friendly and more provides more details.

** Cons: Implementation is harder, and we have to ensure minimal errors or bugs.

=== AutoComplete feature
==== Proposed Implementation
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Logic handles the autocomplete logic. While Commandbox will receive the result and populate the context menu based on output from logic.

** Pros: Easy to change autocomplete logic in the future if need be, such as integrating prefix suggestions, which require the dashboard's data;

** Cons: Need to access the autocomplete component. Hard to pass props to logic with regards to textbox like caret position.

* **Alternative 2**: Handle all autocomplete logic within command box

** Pros: This would be easier to implement and maintain UI components. Can access TextField directly.

** Cons: Difficult to access other logic components. Handles both UI and logic in the same component. ]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how AutoComplete  behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application. The command box is initialized together in the main window. Logic is initialised and passed into command box.

Step 2. The user attempts to type a command `input` in Command Box.

Step 3. Command Box  calls `Logic#getAutoCompleteResults()` which calls `AutoComplete#completeText(String input)`, which calls `Keywords #commandList(String input)`. This returns a filtered Linked List of possible commands.

Step 4. The Linked List of commands will be passed back into Command Box who will call `populatePopup(LinkedList<String> searchResult)` to make its own ContextMenu to be displayed.

Step 5. The UI now reflects a list of available commands filtered based on text.

The following sequence diagram shows how the autocomplete works.

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
