    "description": "How do ideas about big beasts and the wild inform our socio\u2010cultural worldview? In other words, what is a 'tiger' when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.",
