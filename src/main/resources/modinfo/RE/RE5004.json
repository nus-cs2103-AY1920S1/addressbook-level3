It shows how the interactions between the real estate market with other asset markets, capital markets and the wider economy can be examined using theoretical and empirical analyses. This provides an integrative framework for understanding and forecasting the forces that shape the rental space market, the investment asset market, and the development industry. In addition, the module examines linkages between macroeconomic trends and business cycles and the behavior of real estate market aggregates such as prices, rents, and returns.",
