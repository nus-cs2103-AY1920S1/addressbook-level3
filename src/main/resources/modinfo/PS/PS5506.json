    "description": "This graduate module explains how the powerful forces or actors of globalization led to pro\u2010market neoliberal reforms in the nature of state formation and introduced changes in public governance (policy and administration). In particular, it analyses the neoliberal mode of public management, known as the reinvention or new public management (NPM) model. The module examines major elements of NPM \u2010 type reforms (e.g.privatization, outsourcing, public\u2010private partnership, managerial autonomy, and financial decentralization) in East and Southeast Asia. It evaluates the impact of globalization\u2010led neoliberal reforms on democracy, citizen\u2010administration relations,and corruption by using a politic\u2010economic perspective on globalization, state formation, and governance.",
