== Introduction

This program is targeted at clerks working in small clinics. It is designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). It allows clerks to manage queues, set appointments and manage the inventory. Typing fast allows you to complete your tasks much faster than GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `clerkPro.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
