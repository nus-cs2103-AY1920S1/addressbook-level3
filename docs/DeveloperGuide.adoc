== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Task feature
==== Description of feature
Within every project, there are tasks to be done or milestones to be achieved within certain deadlines. The diagram below shows the class diagram of the task class and how it interacts with the model.

.Class Diagram for Task

image::TaskClassDiagram.png[]

As shown above, each project stores multiple tasks in a list. These tasks can be stored, deleted, edited and sorted very easily.
Here are some task related commands that can be executed by the app.

. addTask - adds a task into the project model.
. deleteTask - removes a task from the project model based on index specified by user
. editTask - edits a task of the given index with attribute/s to edit e.g deadline/description/whether is done
. sortTask - sorts the list of tasks based on specification given by user. (more info available in section 3.3)

==== Details
As seen in figure 9, each task consists of 3 parameters namely description, time and a boolean state to show whether the task is done/in progress.
A typical task will look like this on the app: +

image::TASK.png[]

=== Meeting feature
==== Description of feature
Within every project, there are meetings to be held at certain time. The diagram below shows the class diagram of the task class and how it interacts with the model.

.Class Diagram for Meeting

image::MeetingClassDiagram.png[]

As shown above, each project stores multiple meetings in a list. These meetings are automatically sorted based on the time in ascending order.
Here are some task related commands that can be executed by the app.

. addProjectMeeting - adds a meeting into the project model.
. deleteProjectMeeting- removes a meeting from the project model based on index specified by user

==== Details
As seen in figure 10, each meeting consists of 2 parameters namely description and time to show what is the meeting about and the date and time of the meeting respectively.
A typical task will look like this on the app: +

image::ProjectMeeting.png[]


=== Sorting feature
==== Description of feature

Sorts some lists based on specifications provided by the user.
There are 2 lists that are able to be sorted so far. +

. Sort list of tasks
. Sort list of spending

The implementation is similar for these 2 methods. It makes use of `SortingOrder`, which is
a container class that stores the current sort order as well as methods to get and set these orders.
`SortingOrder` can be found in the `model` package.
Currently there are 5 different methods to sort the lists.

. Alphabetical order
. Increasing order of time
. Whether tasks are done
. Whether tasks are done and then by increasing order of time
. Increasing price

[NOTE]

Methods 3-4 are only for sorting tasks whereas method 5 is for sort spending.
Methods 1-2 can be used to sort both lists.

==== Details
Both commands sortTask and sortSpending take in a single integer as parameter. As mentioned in the
note above, 1-4 are valid input for sortTask, 1, 2 and 5 are valid for sortSpending.

An example command would be `sortTask 1` which sorts the list of tasks by alphabetical order.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of obtaining a list with the new sorting order
and updating the current sort order in `SortingOrder` class.

.Sequence Diagram for sortTask
image::SortTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

These are the stages shown in figure 9. Stages are similar for sort spending as well.

. Parses the input to obtain the index.
. Goes to `SortingOrder` to change the current sorting order to the one linked to the given index based on the specification shown above.
. Obtains list of tasks from model and sorts it. List now maintains this sorting order and displays a sorted list even after adding or editing elements.
. Display the newly sorted task list.

.Activity Diagram for sortTask
image::SortTaskActivityDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows sortTask works. There are 2 possible error messages that can occur. Firstly,
if the user inputs an index that is not applicable to the type of items sorted. For example, `sortTask 5`
is invalid as index 5 is linked to a price sorting mechanism which is not applicable to sorting tasks. Secondly,
an error will be shown if the user attempts to sort the items in the same order is the current sorting order.
For example, since the default sorting order for tasks is by increasing order of date, the command `sortTask 3`
will be invalid if the sorting order has never been changed before. Otherwise if the input is valid,
the sorting will occur and the newly sorted task list will be displayed.


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the sort commands


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the data in list.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: May have performance issues as list has to be sorted every time a new element is added or edited.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the data in a PriorityQueue.
** Pros: Much more efficient in terms of performance and complexity. Internal list will automatically be updated which means
no additional sorting needed when adding or editing new elements.
** Cons: Have to create and add all the tasks into another PriorityQueue if the sorting order were to be changed. Harder to implement.





=== Sending Reminder feature
==== Description of feature

Sends reminder for tasks and meetings that are due in the number of days given by the user input.

The basic implementation uses javax.Mail to send email to other email addresses. The Mailer class has static method sendEmail which is responsible for sending all kinds of email to a given recipient(s). User's email account information is stored in the Model class and subsequent queries regarding mailing will use this information that has been stored to send the email. Currently, only gmail server has been made available for use in sending the emails.

[NOTE]
User Email  Account Information is stored through the signIn command.

==== Details
SendReminder takes in a single integer as parameter. The integer will be the duration in days from the current times in which the meetings and tasks are due.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of sending reminder to the project members.

.Sequence Diagram for sendReminder
image::SendReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

These are the stages shown in figure 9. Stages are similar for sort spending as well.

. Parses the input to obtain the duration.
. Goes to `Model` to get the the Meetings and Tasks.
. Obtains list of tasks and meetings which are due in the duration time.
. Goes to `Model` to get the members in the project.
. Sends email to all the members about the upcoming meetings and tasks in the project.
. Display the success message.

.Activity Diagram for sortTask
image::SendReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how sendReminder works. There are 2 possible error messages that can occur. Firstly,
if the user inputs nothing as the duration and input cannot be empty error message is shown. Secondly,
an error will be shown if the user non-numeric number as the duration of time.


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the sort commands


* **Alternative 1:** Storing List<Person> in the Project for members.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Do not need to look for the person object in the addressBook from the List of String of 
members' names in the project.
** Cons: Introduces coupling and may cause unwanted bugs due to cyclic depencdencies as Project contains Person and 
Person contains Project.
* **Alternative 2:** Stores members as List<String> of members names.
** Pros: Reduces coupling and and eliminates cyclic dependencies between Project and Person object..
** Cons: Have to hash the members object in the addressBook by names and go through the List<String> of members'
names one by one to get the Person object of the member. Harder to implement.


=== Generate meeting timeslot
==== Description of Feature

The timeslot generator is used to suggest meeting timings by making use of team members' timetable.

[NOTE]
This feature makes heavy use of the class `TimeRange`, which represents a period of time in a week, e.g. MONDAY 1000 -- MONDAY 1200.

The main logic of this feature is contained within the `TimeSlotGenerator` class:

`TimeSlotGenerator(members, desiredMeetingDuration, restrictedTimeRange)`

* `members`: `List<TimeTable>` of members of the checked-out `Project`
* `desiredMeetingDuration`: How long the meeting would last in hour, expressed as a positive integer
* `restrictedTimeRange`: Sets the limit of generated `TimeRange`, e.g. restrict meeting to working hours, from MONDAY 0900 - MONDAY 1800

Only the two following methods are exposed:

* `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` -- Generate timeslot suitable for *_all_* `TimeTable` supplied. Returns a list of `TimeRange`, or an empty list of `TimeRange` if no such timeslot is available.
* `TimeSlotGenerator#generateWithMostMembers()` -- Generate timeslot where *_most_* members of the currently checked out project are available. Returns a list of `TimeRange`.

==== Details

This feature depends on the timetable stored internally as an attribute of each members:

image::GenerateSlotClassDiagram.png[]

Typical usage of `TimeSlotGenerator` would be look like this:

`List<TimeRange> availableTimeSlots = new TimeSlotGenerator(members, desiredMeetingDuration, restrictedTimeRange).generate()`

The following sequence diagram shows the entire process of generating timeslot after the command `generate d/2` is given:

image::GenerateSlotSequenceDiagram.png[]

As shown in the sequence diagram above, the command execution would go through the following stages:

. Fetch the data of members in the current project and pass them to the `TimeSlotGenerator`.
. `TimeSlotGenerator` will extract their timetable and generate all possible `TimeRange`.
. Display result for the user to view all the possible timeslots that a meeting can be held.

[NOTE]
If `generate()` returns an empty `List<TimeRange>`, the program should automatically call `generateWithMostMembers()` and return it as result, informing the user that there is no timeslot where all members are available.

The following activity diagram summarizes the general flow of the command `generate`:

.`generate` command tries to provide best possible meeting timeslot
image::GenerateSlotActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Algorithm Used

===== `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()`

. Combine all the given `TimeTable` into a single `List<TimeRange> combined`
. `combined` is then processed further by merging overlapping `TimeRange` into a single `TimeRange`. E.g. `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1000, MONDAY, 1200)` and `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1200, MONDAY,1400)` are merged together to form a single `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1000, MONDAY, 1400)`. `List<TimeRange> merged` is then passed on to the next stage.
. `merged` is then inverted, and returns `List<TimeRange> inverted` containing all timeslots where all the members are free.
. `inverted` is then processed to ensure that all `TimeRange` falls within `restrictedTimeRange` specified by the user, truncating all `TimeRange` that extends beyond the specified `restrictedTimeRange`, returning `List<TimeRange> truncated`.
. The algorithm then filters `inverted` by rejecting all `TimeRange` that last shorter than `desiredMeetingDuration` specified by the user. This `List<TimeRange> accepted` is then passed back to the caller of this method, and the algorithm terminates.

===== `TimeSlotGenerator#generateWithMostMembers()`

. Iterates over all possible combinations of timetables in descending order of number of timetable.
. For each possible combination, call `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()`.
. If `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` returns an empty list, repeat step 2 again.
. Algorithm terminates, returning the combination of List<TimeTable> used and available timings `List<TimeRange>` wrapped in a class `TimeSlotWithMember`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to generate timeslot with most number of available members

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate over all possible combinations of timetables, sorted in descending order of number of timetables, and call `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` on each of these combinations.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed. This implementation takes O(2^n^) time for _n_  members.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a more sophisticated algorithm, like a segment tree.
** Pros: Will use much less time.
** Cons: Harder to implement, and more specialize towards only doing a single task.

We went with options 1 as there is no real difference in speed if the number of members is restricted to below 15 members, which many projects do not normally exceed. It is much easier to understand and maintain by other developers as well.

=== Timetable input
==== Description of Feature
There are two ways to input member's timetable

. Member send a formatted text file to the team leader, which would then be parsed by the system
. Member send their NUSMods timetable URL to the team leader, and the system would fetch their timetable data using NUSMods API

The main logic is implemented within the `AddTimetableCommand` class.

==== Details

Important functions in the `AddTimetableCommand`:

* `AddTimetableCommand#getTimetableFromNUSMods(String url)` -- Fetch timetable data using NUSMods API
* `AddTimetableCommand#getTimetableFromFile(String filepath)` -- Parse file to obtain timetable data

An overview of how the `AddTimetableCommand` class works, shown in figure below:

<INSERT CLASS DIAGRAM, SHOW DEPENDENCIES>

User command would be in the format: `addTimetable m/member [u/url] [f/filepath]`

Below diagram shows the entire process of adding timetable from file:

<INSERT SEQUENCE DIAGRAM FOR FILE INPUT>

Alternatively, user can input using NUSMods shared timetable URL.

Following sequence diagram would delve directly into the process of fetching timetable data using NUSMods API, as the earlier portion of command parsing is similar to the above figure.

<INSERT SEQUENCE DIAGRAM, starting directly from getTimetableFromNUSMods>


==== Design Considerations (DO I EVEN NEED THIS PORTION???)

===== Aspect: How to input timetable

Alternatively, we can input timetable on the command line manually, but we realized that it is too troublesome and unrealistic for the user to type in so much timetable data of his many members.


// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Implementation-Checkout]]
=== Checkout
This allows user to checkout to a project from a list of project to work on it.
Almost every command regarding the project require the user to checkout first.

How it works is the ModelManager class is holding an additional `Optional<Project>` 
attribute and the model supports three new methods:

* `setWorkingProject()` -- Sets the attribute to the argument of the method.
* `getWorkingProject()` -- Returns the current project.
* `isCheckedOut()` -- Checks whether the current working project is empty.

A typical use of the command can be seen in the sequence diagram below.

image::CheckoutSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Implementation-Change-in-UI-display]]
=== Change in UI display
The first step of changing UI display is to find out
whether a change in UI is needed given a command from user.
This is done in the CommandResult class constructor. If a command
word matches either of the four words `list, checkout, listBudget, addProject`,
the flag of whether a change in UI is needed will be set to true.

Next, a class to represent a state of UI is needed to remember
a history which is the `UiEvent` class.
UiEvent is a class that represent a type of UiDisplay as an
event. It stores the current state of the application's UI and the current working project if it exists.
The `viewHistory` is stored in the `MainWindow` class as a stack of UiEvents
and it also maintains a currentStatePointer. When a `back` command
is executed, it can check back on what is the previous state.

* `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` -- Change the Ui and change the current state.
* `MainWindow#getPreviousState` -- Pops the stack and peek to look for the previous state.
* `MainWindow#handleBack` -- Change the Ui display to the previous state.

Given below is an example of how the UI behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `viewHistory` will be initialized with the initial
`PROJECT_LIST` state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to
that single address book state.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `checkout 1` command to checkout to preoject 1 to work on.
During the execution of the `checkout` command, at the commandresult generation step,
it detects that there is a need to change the Ui and the flag is made to true.
In the `MainWindow`, since a change is needed, `MainWindow#changeUi` is called
to change the display and set the `currentState` to be `PROJECT_OVERVIEW`.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState1.png[]

Step 3. The user now decide to add a budget by `addBudget b/ equipment 3000.00`.
This command does not need a change in Ui display thus the flag is false.
However, the method `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` is still called but this time
it is called to update the information in the current display and set the
current state to be still the current state. Thus, the `currentStatePointer` does
not move.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, a `commandResult` wont be generated thus no change in Ui will happen.

Step 4. The user now wants to have a better view of the budgets and executes
`listBudget`. Same step follows through the checkout command.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState3.png[]

Step 5. The user now decides to go back to the home page and executes
two consecutive `back` command. At the execute stage in `MainWindow`,
it detects it is a back command and `MainWindow#handleBack` is called.
This method will then pop the current state by `MainWindow#getPreviousState`
and call `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` to display the previous Ui.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState4.png[]
image::ChangeUiDisplayState5.png[]


[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at `PROJECT_LIST`, then there are
no previous UI states to go back. Under such situation, an error will be returned.
