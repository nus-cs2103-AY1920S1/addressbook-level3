    "description": "According to conventional wisdom, Chinese women in history were particularly oppressed. It was only in the modern period that the patriarchal system started to break down and gender equality was finally realized. Such a simplistic view of dividing Chinese women\u2019s experiences into two mutually exclusive categories of 'traditional' and 'modern' is misleading. This course sets out to provide a more complex and nuanced picture of the life of Chinese women over time in China and elsewhere. Topics cover include marriage, women\u2019s education, works and property rights, ideas about the female body and chastity and so on.",
