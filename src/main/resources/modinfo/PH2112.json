    "description": "Non-classical logic builds on classical logic in two ways.\nFirst, classical logic can be extended with modal\noperators, to reason about necessity and possibility,\nobligation and permission, and past and future.\nClassical logic can also be weakened, to accommodate\nvagueness, paradox, failures of relevance and circular\nreasoning. In this course, non-classical logic is\nexplored in both these directions.",
