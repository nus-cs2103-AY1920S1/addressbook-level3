    "description": "This module will examine the production, reception and interpretation of female imagery and representations of gender roles for Japanese women through visual images and literary texts from the 11th to the 20th century, with an emphasis leaning towards the modern period. The female image occupies a crucial part in understanding key historical and cultural developments in Japan, such as the evolving influence of Westernization and modernity on Japanese society during the early decades of the 20th century. Students will analyse a wide range of materials ranging from the 11th century novel to literary pieces by renowned modern authors.",
