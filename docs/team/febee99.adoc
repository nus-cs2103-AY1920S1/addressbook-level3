== PROJECT: Xpire

== Overview

Given the task to augment an address book desktop application for our software engineering project, my team and I
decided to transform it into Xpire, an expiry date tracker. Xpire targets students living on campus, allowing them to track,
identify and replenish any items, including but not limited to, perishable items like food, makeup and medicine, that have either already expired, are
fully depleted, or expiring soon.

== Notations and formatting used
[NOTE]
This symbol is often followed by essential information that you can take note of.

`sort`:
A word styled in a different font (otherwise known as a markup) indicates a
command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.
This notation can also represent a component, class or object in the architecture.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team project._
|===

* *Major enhancement: the ability to view different lists and execute only commands permissible for the list specified*
** What it does: allows the user to view the list of items to be replenished from the main tracking list of items and vice versa. In the replenish list, certain commands are intentionally prohibited.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user can view and search for his or her items that have run out and replenish them as soon as possible. Items in the replenish list
are also differentiated from the items in the main tracking list, by limiting the commands available. This is founded on the basis that certain commands such as sorting by date would be rendered irrelevant as
items to be replenished do not have an expiry date or quantity unlike those in the main list.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to avoid making major changes to existing commands and littering of duplicate code
chunks. The implementation was also challenging because it requires a good command of generics to ensure that existing commands would work well with both items in the main tracking list and items to be
replenished, without making drastic changes to the code base.

* *Major enhancement: the ability to recommend similar words for correction if any when a user makes mistakes in his or her input*
** What it does: recommends closely-related words detected in comparison to the user input
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them. With spelling corrections, they can now easily identify
their input mistakes and correct them with ease.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to avoid major lags in the performance
of existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to store both the main list and replenish list in one single json object. This allows the user to read and write to the json file from the command-line interface for both lists.

* *Minor enhancement*: made certain commands such as sort and search stackable. This has great utility when there are lots of items and one search is insufficient to sieve out an item.
This allows users to narrow down to items with greater ease, by sorting or searching the results of previous searches.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to auto-sort as well as manually sort items in both lists by their name or date,
allowing the user to add items and have them arranged in an organised fashion.

* *Minor enhancement*: added expiry date and quantity fields to item, and disallowed adding of items with expiry dates before today.

The figure below presents what happens when a user executes a command with invalid arguments.

[NOTE]
Only search and sort commands support this operation.

In the example below encapsulated in a sequence diagram, the user has misspelled `"date"` as `"dat"` in a sort command.

The sequence diagram titled `find similar words` below expands on the process omitted above.

.Sequence diagram showing how `"date"` is found to be the most similar word to `"dat"`

image::FindSimilarSequenceDiagram.png[]

The function `findSimilar` in `StringUtil` is called upon to return a set containing strings that are most similar to the misspelled argument, `"dat"`.
In this process, `"dat"` is compared with a set of valid inputs, i.e. both `"name"` and `"date"`, and the corresponding edit distances are stored.
`getSuggestions("dat")` then filters the results and finds `"date"` to be the best match.

At last, a `ParseException` which contains the recommendation `"date"`
is then thrown to the user as feedback.

==== Design Considerations
When tasked to implement this feature, I had to decide on what was the best way to display any form of recommendations to the user.
I also evaluated multiple options to derive an optimal data structure to store the recommendations. The following is a brief summary of my analysis and decisions.

===== Aspect: How recommendations execute

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays recommendations after the user inputs a command that fails to produce results.
** Pros: Simpler and straightforward implementation.
** Cons: May be less intuitive to the user as opposed to auto-completed commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Auto-completion of commands.
** Pros: Lowers likelihood of spelling mistakes in user input.
** Cons: We must ensure that the structure of every single command and their variations are taken into consideration.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the recommendations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a TreeMap to store entries that comprise a set of recommendations and their corresponding edit distance.
** Pros: Entries are automatically sorted by their edit distance, thus words with a smaller edit distance will be recommended first. Duplicate entries are also prohibited.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Store all possible recommendations in a long list.
** Pros: Simpler implementation.
** Cons: Not closely related words may also be recommended to the user.
