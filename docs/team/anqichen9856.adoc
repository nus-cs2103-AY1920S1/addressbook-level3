== Overview

This Project Portfolio documents my contributions to MooLah, a student project for a Software
Engineering module.
//Expense tracker is inherently troublesome...
//streamline this process
//Add natty and refer to top
//UG - quick start - Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Alfred.

//provide context - module
//all features of app
MooLah is a desktop application used for tracking expenses or events, managing budgets and statistics.
It is morphed from seedu project AddressBook - Level 3.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions
//The following is a summary of my contributions to the feature.
//preface - main role
//user - use "their" plural form instead of "his/her"
//how does it integrate with the other components?

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to track expenses under budgets, and manage different budgets*
** What it does: allows the user to add, switch, modify and delete budgets.
** Justification:
//what problem does it solve? users need a tool to ... allowances..This enables them to ... spending habits
//and be more controlled with their own expenses
This feature improves the product significantly because it helps the user cultivate better financial
management habits and regulate spending according to a budget's limit.
** Highlights:
//what do you want to claim credit for
//make sure it syncs with undo redo
//have to learn a whole new set of things to make it work

This feature allows users to add, edit, switch, delete, clear budgets as well as switch the budget window
to view expenses in a past period. It involves adjustments to the existing model, logic, UI components, and integrates
well with the current implementation of other core features such as undoredo and statistics.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used
in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
