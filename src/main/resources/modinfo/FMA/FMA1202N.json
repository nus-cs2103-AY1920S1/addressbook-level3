    "description": "We will explore the fascinating fields of Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroeconomics. By exploring recent research, we will examine how our brains make decisions \u2013 examining the neurobiology of gambling, wine evaluation, dieting, and even how hormones and genes can alter how you respond to others (altruism and morality). We will start off with an initial orientation on the brain and research techniques, and then take a discussion level approach to exploring these intriguing experiments. The focus will be the use of primary literature to facilitate critical thinking skills. Students will write weekly reaction papers and lead presentation on one paper.",
