== Introduction

Xpire is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expiry dates of items*.
More importantly, Xpire is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have trouble
tracking your items' expiry dates, Xpire can help you manage and notify you of items that are
soon-expiring. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `xpire.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Xpire.
.  In the home folder for Xpire, launch the jar file using the `java -jar xpire.jar` command on
Terminal (for macOs) or Command Prompt (for Windows) to start the app. The GUI should appear in
a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `*view*|main` : views all items in the main list
* `*check*|20` : views items that are going to expire within 20 days
* `*add*|Banana|25/9/2020` : adds an item named `Banana` with expiry date `25/9/2020` to list
* `*delete*|3` : deletes the 3rd item shown in the current list
* `*exit*` : exits the app

.  Xpire not only has a list to track you perishable items, but also a *to-buy* list (replenish list).
The *to-buy* list is to help you keep track of the things you want to replenish. You can move your items from the
tracking list to the replenish list once they are consumed or expired.
* `*shift*|1` : moves the 1st item from the tracking list (main list) to the replenish list

.  Some commands are only applicable for items in the tracking list. Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Graphic User Interface

=== GUI components

image::GUI.png[width="790"]

The above image shows you the Graphic User Interface(GUI) of Xpire with its major components annotated. +
You can refer to the following sections for details on what each component does.

==== View List
There are two lists shown on the GUI, `View` and `All Items`. On the left is the `View` list.
This is an active list that shows you the current view of items. As you manipulate the items using
`search`, `view` or `check`, `View` list will change accordingly to show you only the items you want to see.

// tag::card[]
==== Item Card
image::ItemCard.png[width="710"]

This is how your item will look like in the `View` list. The number on the right is the number of days left before the item expires.

The colour of the item card changes according to
the status of your item. +

* An *expired* item will be red. +

image::Expired.png[width="500]

* An item that is *expiring soon* will be yellow. You can set when to mark an item yellow based
on individual cases. See more information here: <<Reminder>>.

image::ReminderCard.png[width="500]

* An item that has *not expired* and is not going to expire soon will be green.

image::ItemCard.png[width="710"]
// end::card[]

==== All Items List

You can find all your items on the right, in the `All Items` list.

image::AllItems.png[width="300"]

The `All Items` list provides you with a static view of all your items in the app in alphabetical order. Here items are categorized into tracked items and to-buy items. You can click on the list
name to view items in the list, or click again to collapse the list. Clicking on the item name will show you the
expiry date of the item if it has one.

==== FeedbackBox

Below the `View` list panel, you can find a rectangle box which acts like a "feedback window".

image::FeedbackBox.png[width="500"]

Feedback on
the successful execution of the command will be displayed in this box. If an illegal command is entered, you will
also be able to see a failure message and relevant suggestions in the box.

==== CommandBox

Finally, at the very bottom, you can find a small rounded rectangle box that says "Enter command here...".

image::CommandBox.png[width="500"]

This is where you can type your command. The maximum you can type is 60 characters. Try typing `add|Banana|1/11/2020` and press kbd:[enter], and you will see it appears in your lists!


=== Tips

// tag::expand[]
==== Expand cards
When you reduce the window size, the name or other details of the item in the item card could be shortened with `...`.
You can click on the card to expand it and view more information.

image::ShortenedCard.png[width="500"]
image::ExpandCard.png[width="500"]
// end::expand[]

//tag::resize[]
==== Resize Feedback Box

When the feedback message is too long, you can either scroll or adjust the height of the feedback box to display more information.
To resize, simply drag the horizontal bar above the feedback box to your desired position as shown below.

image::ShortenedFeedbackBox.png[width = "500]
image::ExpandedFeedbackBox.png[width = "500]
// end::resize[]

// tag::retrieve[]
==== Retrieve Previous Entry

Just like any other Command Line App, you can easily retrieve your previous commands or go back to later commands using the
kbd:[↑] and kbd:[↓] keys on your keyboard. You can call back up to 20 commands you entered.
// end::retrieve[]

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words that are enclosed with `<` and `>` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `set reminder|<index>|<reminder threshold>`, `<index>` and `<reminder threshold>` are parameters which can be used as `set reminder|1|7`.
* Tags are recognised with the prefix `#` on the CLI. e.g. Xpire recognises `Fruit` as a name while `#Fruit` as a tag.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `check[|<days>]` can be used as `check|7` or `check`.
* Optional parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. e.g. for [<other tags>]..., the following format for Tag Command: `tag|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...` can be used as `tag|1|#Fruit #Frozen #Cold` or `tag|1|#Fruit`.
* Trailing `|` (s) are allowed. e.g. `add|banana|2/2/2020|||` or `sort|name|`.
====

=== Common features

// tag::help[]
==== Opening the help window: `help`

Use the command `help` to access the help window.

Example:

Let's say that you wanted to view all your items that are expiring soon, but have forgotten the command word for this purpose.
Instead of trying all possible inputs, you can simply type `help` into the command box, to find the command word `check` that you have looking for.

.Help window
image::help.png[width="790"]
// end::help[]

// tag::view[]
==== Viewing all items : `view`

===== Viewing all items in another list

To toggle between the main list and the list of items to be replenished, you
can use the command `view|<list name>`. This shows you all the items in the list automatically sorted by their name
(lexicographical order) then date (chronological order). +

Examples:

Let's say that you have completely depleted some items, namely `Cherry` and `Coco Crunch` in the main tracking list, and you wish to view these items
that have been automatically shifted to the replenish list. You can do so by typing `view|replenish` in the command box
to change your current list view to that shown in the figure below.

.Items in replenish list viewed
image::view-replenish.png[width="790"]

Perhaps after viewing all your items in the replenish list, you wish to return to the main tracking list to add some items
that you have recently purchased. You can easily return to the main list, by typing `view|main` in the command box.
This is also depicted in the figure below.

.Items in main tracking list viewed
image::view-main.png[width="790"]

===== Viewing all items in the current list

To view all the items in the current list, you can simply enter the command `view`.
[NOTE]
If you have not previously toggled the list view, this command will display the main tracking list by default.

Example:

Let's say that you have been searching for an item in the main tracking list, and you are shown the item found.
To return back to the main list that displays all the items tracked, you can simply enter the command `view`.

.Items in current list viewed
image::view-current.png[width="790"]
// end::view[]


// tag::tag[]
==== Tagging an item : `tag`

===== Display all tags created
Shows all the tags in the current list view.

Format: `tag`

[NOTE]
Like `help` and `export`, this command is not undoable. +
This command does not show tags of items that are not on the current list on the screen. +
If you would like to view all the tags in the main list or the replenish list, simply key in `view`, followed by `tag`!

===== Add new tag(s) to an item

.Item at index 4 tagged with #Fruit and #Yellow
image::tag.png[width="790"]

Tags an item from the list according to your own input +
Format: `tag|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...`

[TIP]
You can tag a particular item with more than 2 tags or more at a time. Just be mindful of the 5 tags per item limit!

****
* Tags the item at the specified `<index>`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ... ).
* Your tags must be prefixed with a '#'.
* You are only allowed a maximum of 5 tags per item.
* Tag lengths are restricted to 20 characters. Make use of those 20 characters wisely!
* Your tags will be formatted in Sentence-Case (i.e. first letter will be upper-case while the rest of the letters are lower-case).
****

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`tag|2|#Nestle #Caffeine` +
Tags the 2nd item in the main list with `#Nestle` and `#Caffeine`.
// end::tag[]


// tag::delete[]
==== Deleting an item or its tags: `delete`
If you would like to delete an item or its related fields from the list, the `delete` command can be used.

===== Deleting an item
If you would like to delete a particular item from your list, simply follow the format: `delete|<index>`.

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`delete|2` +
Deletes the 2nd item in the main list.
* `sort|name` +
`delete|3` +
Deletes the 3rd item in the sorted main list.
* `search|potato` +
`delete|1` +
Deletes the 1st item in the results of the `search` command.

// end::delete[]

// tag::deletetag[]
===== Deleting certain tags from an item
If you would like to delete tag(s) from a particular item, use the `delete` command in the format: +
Format: `delete|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...` +

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`delete|3|#Fruit #Food` +
Deletes the tags `#Fruit` and `#Food` from the 3rd item in the main list.

// end::deletetag[]
****
* The index refers to the index number shown on the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Tags must be prefixed with a '#'.
* The item must contain the tags to be deleted.
****

// tag::search[]
==== Searching for item(s) by name and/or tag: `search`

Having a hard time looking for an item in Xpire? Not to worry, Xpire provides a search functionality to aid you in finding your items with ease.

With `search`, you can simply input any words or phrases and Xpire will display all items whose names or tag(s) contain any of the given keywords.


Format: `search|<keyword>[|<other keywords>]...`

.Items matching #fruit or chicken shown
image::search.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
`search` is designed to work only on the current view list. In other words, `search` will only
display matching items which exists in the current view list.

[TIP]
You can do an AND search, e.g. search for items that contains BOTH `red` and `apple` in its name,
by keying `search|red` and then `search|apple`. Suppose there are only 3 items in your list, e.g.
 `red fuji apple`, `red strawberry` and `green apple` (see Figure 6), the above commands will display only `red
 fuji apple` (see Figure 7).

.Item list before searching
image::search-initial.png[width="790"]

.Item list after keying `search|red` and then `search|apple`
image::search-after.png[width="790"]

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `ham` will match `Ham` and `#fruit` will match `#Fruit`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Turkey Ham|Apple` will match `Apple|Turkey Ham`.
* Only the name and tag fields, if any, are searched.
* For name search, partial words can be matched e.g. `Papa` will match `Papayas`.
* For tag search, only exact words will be matched e.g. `#Fruit` will match `#Fruit` but `#Fru` will not match `#Fruit`.
* Items matching at least one keyword will be returned (an OR search). e.g. `Apple|Pear` will return `Granny Smith Apple` and `Japanese Pear`.
* If no items are found, any closely related keywords, if any, will be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `search|kebab` will display `Chicken Kebab` and `kebab` (see Figure 8).

.Item list after keying `search|kebab`
image::search-kebab.png[width="790"]

* `search|Chicken Ham` will display `Chicken Ham` (see Figure 9).

.Item list after keying `search|Chicken Ham`
image::search-chicken-ham.png[width="790"]

* `search|milk|tea|#Drink` will display any items with names containing `milk` or `tea`, or with the tag `#Drink`.
// end::search[]

// tag::shift[]
==== Shifting an item from one list to another: `shift`
Let's say one of your items has expired and you want to stock up on this particular item.
Simply use the `shift` command to transfer this item to the replenish list so that you will know which items you need to replenish.
Once you have stocked up on your expired items, you can similarly use the `shift` command again
to keep track of the item's new expiry date.

===== Shifting an item from the main list to the replenish list
[TIP]
If you would like to view the list of expired items, simply type `check|0`.
From this list of expired items, you can use the `shift` command to move any item into the replenish list.

Format: `shift|<index>`

Let's say you have this list of expired items and you want to remind yourself to replenish the first item in the list--the ice cream.
To do so, you can transfer the ice cream to the replenish list by typing `shift|1`, where `1` refers to item number displayed.

.Current list view of items that have expired.
image::shift_to_replenish_command_example.png[width="790"]

With this, your item will be shifted to the replenish list as seen from the figure below.
When you go for grocery shopping in future, you can refer to this handy replenish list to stock up on your ice cream, or any items that have run out.

.List view of items in the replenish list after executing `Shift` command.
image::shift_to_replenish_success.png[width="790"]

===== Shifting an item from the replenish list to the main list
After some shopping, you may have stocked up on the items that were in the replenish list.
Now, you want to add these items back to your tracking list to keep track of their new expiry dates.
To do so, you can simply use the `shift` command again.

Format: `shift|<index>|<expiry date>[|quantity]`

For example, you have just replenished the ice cream and you wish to keep track of its expiry date again.
To transfer the ice cream back to the tracking list, simply key in `shift|3|<expiry date>[|<quantity>]`.

.List view of items in the replenish list.
image::shift_to_main_command_example.png[width="790"]

Now, the ice cream that you just bought is added back to the tracking list.

.List view of items in the main list after shift.
image::shift_to_main_success.png[width="790"]


****
* Item quantity **must be a positive integer** 1,2,3...
* When not specified, the item quantity is assumed to be 1.
****


[TIP]
If you only have one of a particular item, you only need to key in the item number and expiry date (without keying in the quantity)!
We'll do the rest for you.
// end::shift[]

// tag::tag[]
==== Tagging an item : `tag`

===== Display all tags created
Shows all the tags in the current list view.

Format: `tag`

[NOTE]
Like `help` and `export`, this command is not undoable. +
This command does not show tags of items that are not on the current list on the screen. +
If you would like to view all the tags in the main list or the replenish list, simply key in `view`, followed by `tag`!

===== Add new tag(s) to an item

.Item at index 4 tagged with #Fruit and #Yellow
image::tag.png[width="790"]

Tags an item from the list according to your own input +
Format: `tag|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...`

[TIP]
You can tag a particular item with more than 2 tags or more at a time. Just be mindful of the 5 tags per item limit!

****
* Tags the item at the specified `<index>`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ... ).
* Your tags must be prefixed with a '#'.
* You are only allowed a maximum of 5 tags per item.
* Tag lengths are restricted to 20 characters. Make use of those 20 characters wisely!
* Your tags will be formatted in Sentence-Case (i.e. first letter will be upper-case while the rest of the letters are lower-case).
****

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`tag|2|#Nestle #Caffeine` +
Tags the 2nd item in the main list with `#Nestle` and `#Caffeine`.
// end::tag[]

==== Deleting variable(s): `delete`

===== Deleting an item
Deletes the specified item from your list. +
Format: `delete|<index>` +

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`delete|2` +
Deletes the 2nd item in the main list.
* `sort|name` +
`delete|3` +
Deletes the 3rd item in the sorted main list.
* `search|potato` +
`delete|1` +
Deletes the 1st item in the results of the `search` command.

// tag::deletetag[]
===== Deleting certain tags from an item
Deletes tag(s) from the specified item. +
Format: `delete|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...` +

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`delete|3|#Fruit #Food` +
Deletes the tags `#Fruit` and `#Food` from the 3rd item in the main list.
// end::deletetag[]

// tag::clear[]
==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Want a quick way of deleting all the items in the current view list?
You can simply type `clear` and all items in the current view list will be deleted immediately.

Format: `clear`

[NOTE]
`clear` is designed to work only on the current view list. In other words, `clear` will only
delete all items which exists in the current view list.

Example:

* While on the current view list (see Figure 10), input `clear` to remove all items in the list (see Figure 11)

.Items in the current view list
image::clear-before.png[width="790"]

.All items in the list have been deleted.
image::clear-after.png[width="790"]

// end::clear[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo previous command : `undo`
Undo the previous command that you have entered in. +
Format: `undo`

[TIP]
`undo` only works on commands that alter your items or the current view! +
Thus, commands such as `help` and `export` are not undoable as they do not alter items or the current view. +
Also, `undo` only works for the last 10 commands. Therefore, make sure you are certain before you type in a command!

The `undo` command also tells you the exact user input you have keyed in as well as what command was entered so that you know what you have undone.

==== Redo an earlier command : `redo`
Redo an earlier command that you have entered in. +
Format: `redo`

This command works in the opposite way as `undo`, it will redo any command that you have undone in the past. +

[NOTE]
Keying in a new command other than `redo` will erase the earlier command that you have undid. Thus, doing so will not allow you to redo that command again.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::export[]
==== Exporting data (multi-platform) : `export`

Thinking of viewing the list of currently tracked items on your mobile phone? Want to have a
copy of the to-buy items on your mobile phone so that you can refer to it while shopping?
With Xpire's `export` feature, you can easily transfer the list of items to any platform
by simply scanning the generated QR code.

Xpire can not only help you track your items' expiry dates, it can also export the current
list of items through a QR code (see Figure 12). Any device with a QR code reader will be
able to download the list of items (see Figure 13).

Format: `export`

.QR code containing the data of the items in the current view list
image::export.png[width="790"]

.List of items received when scanning the QR code through a mobile phone
image::export-phone.PNG[width="250"]

[NOTE]
====
`export` is designed to work only on the current view list. In other words, `export` will only
export all items which exists in the current view list.

Depending on the operating system of your mobile phone, you may be directed to a google search
page after scanning the QR code. Follow the steps below to rectify this issue if necessary.
====

* Upon scanning the QR code, you may see a pop-up prompt suggesting to you to search the content
received on the web (see Figure 14).

.Pop-up prompt to suggest to search the content on the web
image::export-prompt.PNG[width="250"]

* Instead of immediately accepting the suggestion, press and hold on the prompt to reveal the other
options available (see Figure 15). Choose "Copy" or any other similar options.

.Additional options to handle the content
image::export-other-options.PNG[width="250"]

* Once the content has been copied, you can simply paste and save the content on Notes or any other
notepad application on your mobile phone (see Figure 16).

.Pasting and saving exported content onto the mobile phone's built-in notepad application
image::export-save-in-notes.PNG[width="250"]

// end:export[]

// tag::exit[]
==== Exiting the application : `exit`

Exits the application. +
Format: `exit`
// end::exit[]

==== Saving the data
As items will be saved in the hard disk automatically, you do not need to worry about saving manually after executing any command that modifies the list.

=== Main tracking list features only

// tag::add[]
==== Adding an item: `add`
Let's say you bought an item and you want to add it into the tracker to keep track of its expiry date.
This can be done using the `add` command easily.

[TIP]
For items with single quantity, you can save time by keying in only the item name and expiry date.

Format: `add|<item name>|<expiry date>[|<quantity>]`

For example,

.New item added to main tracking list
image::add.png[width="790"]

****
* Item quantity **must be a positive integer** 1,2,3...
* When not specified, the item quantity is assumed to be 1.
* The furthest date allowed as expiry date is 100 years from current date.
****

// end::add[]

==== Deleting an item's quantity: `delete`
//tag::deleteQuantity[]

===== Reducing the quantity of an item
If you would have used up a certain amount of your item, you can use the `delete` command.
By specifying the item number and the quantity to be reduced, you can easily decrease your item's quantity in the tracking list.

Format: `delete|<index>|<quantity>`

Let's say you have just consumed the entire bag of Kettle potato chips as shown in the list below.
Now, you no longer have any more potato chips, so you would like to update the item quantity on the tracking list.
To update the potato chips with the new quantity, simply key in `delete|3|1`.

.Reducing an item quantity
image::delete_quantity_example.png[width="790"]

Since the item has run out, you would also like to add it to the replenish list so that you will be reminded to stock up on it.
To save you the trouble of keying in the details again, our system has already automatically added the chips to the replenish list for you.

.Item that has run out is automatically transferred to the replenish list
image::delete_quantity_shift_success.png[width="790"]
//end::deleteQuantity[]

****
* The index refers to the index number shown on the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* The quantity *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3...
* The quantity specified must be more than the item's current quantity.
****

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`delete|4|1` +
Reduces the quantity of the 4th item by 1.
// end::delete[]

// tag::tag[]
==== Tagging an item : `tag`

===== Display all tags created
Shows all the tags in the current list view.

Format: `tag`

[NOTE]
Like `help` and `export`, this command is not undoable. +
This command does not show tags of items that are not on the list you are viewing. +
If you want to view all the tags in the main list or replenish list, simply key in `view`, followed by `tag`.

===== Add new tag(s) to an item

.Item at index 4 tagged with #Fruit and #Yellow
image::tag.png[width="790"]

[TIP]
An item can have up to 5 tags.

Tags an item from the list according to user input +
Format: `tag|<index>|<tag>[<other tags>]...`

****
* Tags the item at the specified `<index>`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ... ).
* Tags must be prefixed with a '#'.
* Only a maximum of 5 tags allowed per item.
* Tag lengths are restricted to 20 characters. So make use of those 20 characters wisely!
* Tags will be formatted in Sentence-Case (i.e. first letter will be upper-case while the rest of the letters are lower-case).
****

Examples:

* `view|main` +
`tag|2|#Nestle #Caffeine` +
Tags the 2nd item in the main list with `#Nestle` and `#Caffeine`.
// end::tag[]

// tag::setreminder[]
[[Reminder]]
==== Setting reminder for an item: `set reminder`

===== Adding a reminder some days before an item's expiry date
.Reminder set for item at index 4
image::set-reminder.png[width="790"]

Sets a reminder for your item. +
Format: `set reminder|<index>|<reminder threshold>`

Set reminder is designed for you to customise when you want to be alerted of an item's condition.
In the above example, reminder threshold refers to *the number of days before the item's expiry date*.
The reminder for an item will be activated when the number of days left before an item's expiry date is less than or equal to
the reminder threshold. In other words, by setting the reminder threshold
of an item to n days, you start to be reminded of this items n days before its expiry date.

To reduce disturbance, the app does not pop up notifications. Instead, you will be reminded through the alerting yellow colour
of the item whose reminder has been activated in the `View` list. You can also view all items with active reminder through the `check` command.
(Refer to the following section.)

Examples:

* `set reminder|2|4` +
Sets a reminder for the second item in the list 4 days before its expiry date.

===== Removing the reminder for an item
You can remove the reminder for your item by resetting it to the default value 0.
Format: `set reminder|<index>|0`

Examples:

* `set reminder|1|0` +
Removes the reminder for the first item in the list.

****
* All items have their default reminder threshold set to 0.
* Reminder cannot be set on already expired items.
* A reminder cannot be set to be before the current date. For example, if the current date is 20/9/2019
, it is not possible to set the reminder on 19/9/2019 by entering a reminder threshold greater than the item's number of days left.
However, the app understands that you want the reminder to be activated immediately, and will activate the reminder right away.
* The maximum reminder threshold is 36500 days.

==== Listing expiring items: `check`

===== Listing all expiring items with activated reminders and expired items
.Items expiring soon listed
image::check.png[width="790"]

You can easily view all items whose reminder has been activated and who has already expired with the command `check`.
In other words, this command will show you all items that are in red and yellow +
Format: `check`

===== Listing items that will expire within a certain number of days

Sometimes you forget to set a reminder for an item whose expiry date is drawing close. Don't worry, you can
easily make a query for items that will expire within a specified number of days. +
Format: `check|<days>`

****
* Number of days *must be a non-negative integer* 0,1,2,3,..
* Maximum number of days that can be checked is 36500 days.
****

[TIP]
`check|0` lists items that have already expired.

Examples:

* `check|20` +
Lists items expiring in the next 20 days.
// end::check[]

// tag::sort[]
==== Sorting all items : `sort`
[NOTE]
Your items in both lists are sorted by their names by default.

To change the way your items are sorted, you can simply use the command `sort|<key>`,
where <key> can be specified as either date or name.

===== Sorting all items by their date
Example:

Let's say that you are currently on the main tracking list, and you wish to identify all your items expiring next year.
To expedite your search for these items, simply enter the command `sort|date`, and all your items will be sorted by their expiry dates
in chronological order.

As shown in the figure below, Banana that expires on 2nd November 2019 sorts ahead of Strawberry which expires a day later.

.Items sorted by their date
image::sort-date.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
Items that expire on the same day will be sorted by their names.
****
* For example, Apple will sort ahead of Banana, if both have the same expiry date.
****

===== Sorting all items by their name

Example:

Let's say that you have previously sorted your items by their expiry dates to find some items expiring in a certain year.
You can use the command `sort|name` to return your list to its default method of sorting that sorts your items by their names.

[NOTE]
Items with the same name will be sorted by their expiry dates.
****
* For example, Milk that expires today will sort ahead of Milk that expires tomorrow.
****
// end::sort[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo previous command : `undo`
Undo the previous command that you have entered in. +
Format: `undo`

[TIP]
`undo` only works on commands that alter your items or the current view! +
Thus, commands such as `help` and `export` are not undoable as they do not alter items or the current view. +
Also, `undo` only works for the last 10 commands. Therefore, make sure you are certain before you type in a command!

The `undo` command also tells you the exact user input you have keyed in as well as what command was entered so that you know what you have undone.

==== Redo an earlier command : `redo`
Redo an earlier command that you have entered in. +
Format: `redo`

This command works in the opposite way as `undo`, it will redo any command that you have undone in the past. +

[NOTE]
Keying in a new command other than `redo` will erase the earlier command that you have undid. Thus, doing so will not allow you to redo that command again.

== Command Shorthands

If you are looking for a quick way to type and execute the commands, then this section is just
for you. Commands also come with command shorthands which can be used in place of the full command word.

Below is a list of commands and their corresponding command shorthands:

* `help` : `h`
* `add` : `a`
* `view` : `v`
* `set reminder` : `sr`
* `shift` : `sh`
* `check` : `ch`
* `sort` : `so`
* `search` : `se`
* `delete` : `d`
* `tag` : `t`
* `clear` : `cl`
* `undo` : `u`
