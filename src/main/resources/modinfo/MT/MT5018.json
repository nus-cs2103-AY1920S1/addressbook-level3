    "description": "The theme of this course is how open innovation and open business models can generate competitive strategies for both small and large companies. We look at both the strategy making as well as at the strategy implementation. The course draws on recent research and thinking in (open) innovation management and books/materials by leading experts. The course will help students to integrate their knowledge about strategic management, entrepreneurship, and innovation management and it provides new ways of thinking that will lead to the creation of highly differentiated strategies and business models. More specifically, the course focuses on open innovation to particular cases in large companies, the strength and weaknesses of open innovation strategies, and the organization and implementation of open innovation practices. The course also extends beyond open innovation and explores more complex systems such as innovation ecosystems where different types of partners are collaborating to jointly establish a new product or solve a societal problem (e.g. in healthcare or pollution control). Students are requested to apply the knowledge examined in the course to new technologies or scientific disciplines. In particular, group assignments are developed in areas such as healthcare, sustainability and cleantech technologies, and big data.",
