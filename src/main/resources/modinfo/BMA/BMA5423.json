    "description": "Managers, professionals and other business people are increasingly faced with the challenge of operating across borders as companies large and small, established and entrepreneurial, strive for global competitiveness. The challenge of managing successfully, self, and others, in an increasingly complex and global environment is the focus of this module. The module leads students to develop a deeper understanding of how management practices and processes can often differ across national and regional boundaries, and why. Leveraging on this understanding, managers will be led to consider and formulate strategies and tactics for negotiating these differences to develop global management capabilities.",
