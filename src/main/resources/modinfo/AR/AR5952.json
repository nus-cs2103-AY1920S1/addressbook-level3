    "description": "The purpose of this module is to provide an overall account of urban design through an interpretative look at its emergence and evolution since mid 20th century in the western world, and an overview of the urbanization situation within Asian background in selected key cities such as Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore. Furthermore, based on the 'historical approach', the module explores in-depth the current rapid development of Chinese cities to raise some key issues related to 'under what situation urban design has been taking place in China', which attracts much attention worldwide in related fields. The module is not only about the history of urban design and urban issues about Chinese city. The development of urban design in the western world for the past 60 over years could obviously showcase some key issues inevitable in different urbanization or re-urbanization periods which need different response. , The analysis of Chinese urban issues in a practical way provides a different perspective to relook at western urban theories and to discuss an alternative for contemporary developing country cities.",
