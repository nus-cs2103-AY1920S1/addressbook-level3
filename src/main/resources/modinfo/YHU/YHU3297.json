    "description": "What does good reasoning look like? What does it aim for? How should we argue with our opponents? Ny\u0101ya, a tradition within Brahminical Indian philosophy presented and defended sophisticated methods of reasoning and norms for debate that are still being studied today. In this course, we focus on sections of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra in translation and its early commentaries, along with some Buddhist and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 texts. Not only will we consider methods and norms, but we will look at how Indian thinkers put them into practice in arguments on topics such as the existence of God.",
