    "description": "Module is for PhD students. Students are required to undertake two research attachments each with 2 MC on an S/U grading basis. By having two research attachments, a student will not be confined to just one research area. Students will have the flexibility to be attached to two different supervisors or labs and be exposed to different research areas or topics, before deciding on their research interests. A faculty member can supervise the same student for two research attachments. Research attachments can also be conducted during the holidays. All research attachments have to be completed in the first year. Students are required to write a report including literature survey and make oral presentation to the supervisor. Grading is on S/U by the supervisor. Explanation should be provided by the supervisor if an 'Unsatisfactory' grade is awarded.",
