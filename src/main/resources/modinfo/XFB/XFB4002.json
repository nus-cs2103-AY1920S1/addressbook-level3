Students are expected to demonstrate (i) a good understanding of relevant methodology and literature; (ii) the significance and relevance of the problem; (iii) logical and sound analysis; (iv) clear and effective presentation; and (v) achieve a balance between the learning objectives of both the Business course and the second course of study.",
