    "description": "This course is designed for students who desire to have in-depth knowledge about China\u2019s policymaking structure and process. The course will examine how the policymaking process is structured, what are the internal dynamics, and how they impact on policy outcomes, given the China\u2019s political system. The aim is to provide students with a clear understanding that policymaking in China, as in the other politics, is essentially a process of compromise making, in which the actors (policy makers) make decisions according to not just their interests but also their structural positions and the procedures they have to follow in policymaking",
