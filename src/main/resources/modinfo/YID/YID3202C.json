    "description": "We use geological, geophysical, and climate-change data sets to illustrate and master a variety of data analysis techniques important to the study of the environment. The course focuses on earth science topics but incorporates software and algorithms applicable to a variety of fields. Our focus includes statistical distributions, linear-regression modelling, principal-component analysis, and time-series analysis. Students read and present papers on different datasets, and also perform a variety of exercises with these same or similar data sets.
