    "description": "This module acquaints the students with the laws and principles relating to the civil litigation process. The three distinct stages, namely, pre-commencement of action, pre-trial and post-trial are discussed in detail. The overriding aims of the civil justice system will also be deliberated. This will enable the students to better understand and appreciate the rationale of the application of the provisions of the rules of court. In this regard, the students will be able to make a case on behalf of their clients or against their opponents when the perennial issue of non-compliance with procedural rules takes centre stage. This module is designed to prepare the students to practise law in Singapore. Hence, the focus will primarily be on the Singapore Rules of Court and the decisions from the Singapore courts.",
