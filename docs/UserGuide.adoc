== Introduction - What is Dukemon?

.Home screen of Dukemon.
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

*_Welcome to Dukemon_* _, the Flashcard app of the future!_

_Dukemon_ aims to streamline and gamify the process of learning words or definitions through
the use of self-created digital flashcards. *Supercharge your learning with Dukemon!*

== Getting Started

=== Installation

1.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your system.
2.  Download the latest `Dukemon.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home directory of _Dukemon_ (this is where your
data will be stored).
4.  Double-click the `Dukemon.jar` to run the app.
5.  Before getting to the quick start instructions, get familiar with our interface and application modes.

<<<

=== User Interface

.Regions of the UI where commands are entered (via CLI) and feedback from Dukemon is shown.
image::UserGuideCommandBox.png[width="790"]

1. Click on the _CommandBox_ as shown above (region in yellow box) and type commands in.

2. Use kbd:[Enter] to execute commands.
.. e.g. Typing *`help`* into the _CommandBox_ and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the _Help_ window.

3. Text-based feedback for each command entered is shown in the _ResultDisplay_ (region in red box).

In the highlighted section above, you can see the current mode you are in and the available modes.



To transition between them you have to enter the `SwitchCommand` that represents each mode into the Command Box that says _Enter command here.._.

* `open` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `open` mode
* `start` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `game` mode
* `settings` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `settings` mode

Yes, it feels like a steep learning curve >_<

But do not worry as we have the AutoComplete Bar that auto completes the available commands whichever mode you are in.

=== AutoComplete Bar

.AutoComplete Bar
image::AutoCompleteBar.png[width="790"]

The highlighted section shows, what commands are currently available. You can click them to automatically fill it in for you. Each of your keystroke will dynamically update the AutoComplete bar, just like the keyboard on your smartphone.

=== Revision _WordBank_

A revision bank is automatically updated for you, every time a game session ends. +

It is also smart enough to remove the _cards_ if you have cleared it afterwards.

== FAQ

*Q*: _Dukemon_ is not starting up/crashes upon load-up, how can I rectify this? +
*A*: Move _Dukemon_ to a new, *empty* file directory. Ensure that all data and configuration files in the same directory are
deleted (_some files may be corrupted_). _Dukemon_ will perform a clean start from the new directory.

*Q*: The _Game_ failed to start, what can I do? +
*A*: Ensure that your selected _WordBank_ has at least three _Cards_ to be able to start. Also note that
you will be *brought to the _Game_ mode* regardless, and will need to switch out of it.

*Q*: Switching modes is not working, what can I do? +
*A*: Ensure that *you have selected a _WordBank_* before attempting to switch modes. Check that you have *stopped the _Game_ session*
if you want to switch to certain modes.

*Q*: How do I pronounce the app name? +
*A*: Think _Pokemon_.

*Q*: The GUI (Graphical User Interface) seems to be lagging, is this an issue? +
*A*: _Dukemon_ aims to run at around 60fps, but performance varies across machines.

*Q*: How can I transfer/share _WordBanks_ across machines? +
*A*: Use the `export` and `import` functionalities to move data to specific file directories. From there you can
share your files manually. You can make use of the drag and drop feature to accelerate the process.

*Q*: How can I save my data? +
*A*: _Dukemon's_ data is saved to the hard disk automatically (eg. adding _cards_/_words_, statistics etc)
There is no need to manually save data or Game `Statistics`.

*Q*: I edited some files and _Dukemon_ doesn't work properly now. How do I resolve this? +
*A*: Please edit only if you know what you are doing, for non-advanced players, interact through _Dukemon_. +
To resolve, refer to the FAQ: "_Dukemon_ is not starting up/crashes upon load-up, how can I rectify this?".
