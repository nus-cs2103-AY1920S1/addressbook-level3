    "description": "The founding of social science as a special discipline for the study of social phenomena in the late nineteenth century and its development through the twentieth century will be examined in this module. The critique of the physical science model, which was originally used to ground the theory of social science research, will be considered. This course guides students through the various philosophical debates, which shaped the development of modern social science. Attention will also be given to how social science research bears, directly or indirectly, on social practices.",
