    "description": "Anthropologists have long argued against the radical separation of theory and method. Not only does ethnographic observation shape the knowledge it produces; anthropology\u2019s commitment to an intersubjective world determines the kind of embedded observation, 'thick description' and 'grounded theory' that are its stock-in-trade. But what are ethnography and grounded theory in our late modern world, when many of the humanist assumptions on which anthropology was founded have come under critique - feminist, Marxist, queer, and postcolonial? Drawing on ethnographies past and present, this class will explore these questions through a close engagement with ethnographic texts, past and present.",
