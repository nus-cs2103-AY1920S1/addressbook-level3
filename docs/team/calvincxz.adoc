== PROJECT: AddMin+

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an all-in-one administration
desktop application called AddMin+.

AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of the admin staffs in event management companies by allowing them to
effectively handle administrative tasks.

This is what our project looks like:

._The graphical user interface(GUI) for AddMin+._

My role was to design and write the code for the association of employees with event, which includes
everything from front-end display where users can see such an association to the back-end
storage. One interesting point of this feature was the
development of an algorithm which internally checks the schedule of individual employees and prevents
schedule clashes.

The following sections illustrate these features in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these features.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature*: enabled the association of employees with events which includes
_automated/manual allocation of employees to event commands_ and a _de-allocate command_, as well as the
viewing of the association via the _fetch event_ command. All related commands have *GUI features* implemented.

** *What it does*: This feature allows the user to allocate employees to events either manually or using a smart algorithm developed
in AddMin+. The algorithm also ensures that employees cannot be allocated to events with conflicting time periods.
The portable `Fetch Event Window` also allows users to allocate events manpower in the different `Tabs` of AddMin+.

** *Justification*: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now allocate employees to events,
which is a key component for event management companies that our app is targeting. The algorithm used to check for
conflicting schedule is also highly beneficial as users no longer have to waste precious time checking the availability
of every individual employee. The GUI features further provide convenience for users who prefer using the mouse.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it
required the knowledge and understanding of both `Event` and `Employee` classes. The flexibility of the
current design allows users to perform allocation commands in various environments in AddMin+.

* *Minor feature*: added command history to allow user to view and navigate previous commands using up/down
arrow keys.

== Conclusion
Given the time constraints of only 6 weeks for this project, I feel that sufficient progress has been made to build a
great app.
However, the team has plans to turn *AddMin+* into a truly revolutionary app that changes the entire administrative
process.
