    "description": "The module is intended to provide a framework for discussing thematically related questions arising in contemporary philosophy of science and technology. The focus will be on an in-depth study of a specific debate within general philosophy of science (e.g., scientific realism), or on a close examination of a branch within the philosophy of special sciences (e.g., philosophy of biology, philosophy of physics). In exceptional cases, the module may be structured around a suitable recent monograph or collection of papers.",
