    "description": "Southeast Asia is characterised by great ethnolinguistic and cultural variation. How can we make sense of and appreciate this diversity? What is an insiders and outsiders perspective? This course will introduce students to the region from an anthropological perspective. Students will be equipped with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture. Ethnographic materials will be used to discuss themes that include ethnicity, identity, family and kinship systems, gender, economy, and social change. The challenge is for students to explore, conceptualise, and understand differences and similarities between social systems and human relationships, and to ask, Why?",
