== PROJECT: guiltTrip()

---
==== Overview

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but canâ€™t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally!

==== Summary of contributions
History:

* *Major enhancement*: added *Undo and Redo features*
** What it does: allows the user to undo and redo commands.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to be able to modify and easily amend any command line input mistakes.
** Highlights: This feature complements other existing commands and can be used to modify the state of the finance tracker after other commands were executed.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *History feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to view the list of commands previously entered by the user.
** Justification: This feature improves the product as the user now can review his/her previous commands before using the undo or redo command.
** Highlights: This feature acts as a supporting feature to undo and redo through providing user with visual aid on previously entered commands.

=== Contributions to the User Guide

=== Undo/ Redo
==== Undo previous command : `undo`
Restores the finance tracker to the state before the previous undoable command was executed or
before the specified number of undoable commands were executed.

Format: `undo` `undo <step>`

* `<step>`: The number of commands to undo. Additionally the step must be greater than zero and positive.
* `undo <step>` is only executed if the number of undoable commands is more than or equal to `<step>`.
* [NOTE] `undo 1` has the same function as `undo`.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you would like to delete a budget, whereby the budget is located at index 1 as shown below,
key in the command  `deleteBudget 1`.
+

. You should see the budget being deleted in the list of budgets as displayed below.
+
image::undo-2.png[]

. If you would like to undo your deletion, key in the command `undo`.
+
image::undo-3.png[]

. You should see the previously deleted budget back in the list of budgets as displayed below.
+
image::undo-4.png[]

Other examples:

* `delete 1` +
`delete 2` +
`undo 2` (reverses the `delete 2` and `delete 1` commands)

==== Redo previously undone command : `redo`
Reverses the most recent undone command or the specified number of most recent undone commands.

Format: `redo` `redo <step>`

* `<step>`: The number of undone commands to redo. Additionally the step must be greater than zero and positive.
* `redo <step>` is only executed if the number of redoable commands is more than or equal to `<step>`.
* [NOTE] `redo 1` has the same function as `redo`.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you would like to delete a budget, whereby the budget is located at index 1 as shown below,
key in the command  `deleteBudget 1`.
+
image::undo-1.png[]

. You should see the budget being deleted in the list of budgets as displayed below.
+
image::undo-2.png[]

. If you would like to undo your deletion, key in the command `undo`.
+
image::undo-3.png[]

. You should see the previously deleted budget back in the list of budgets as displayed below.
+
image::undo-4.png[]

Other examples:

* `delete 1` +
`delete 2` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 2` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reverses the latest `undo` command) +
`redo` (reverse the latest `undo` command)

* `delete 1` +
`delete 2` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 2` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo 2` (reverses the 2 latest `undo` commands)

=== History
==== View the history of commands entered : `history`
Displays the list of commands entered, from most recent to earliest.

Format: `history`

* [NOTE] `history` can only be executed if there were commands already entered before trying to use `history`.

Example Usage:
[start = 1]
. If you would like to display the list of commands entered, key in the command `history`.
+
image::history-1.png[]

. You should see that the income and expense lists in the main panel are now replaced with the history panel.
+
image::history-2.png[]

. If you would like to return the panel display to its original state, key in the command `list`.
+
image::history-3.png[]

. You should see that the income and expense panels are now back to their original positions.

=== Undo/ Redo

==== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
It extends `GuiltTrip` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `guiltTripStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGuiltTrip#commit()` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#undo()` -- Restores the previous finance trackerk state from its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` and `Model#redoGuiltTrip()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGuiltTrip` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th entry in the finance tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `guiltTripStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

Step 3. The user executes `add typ/Expense...` to add a new expense. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGuiltTrip()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `guiltTripStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` or `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`. Thus, the `guiltTripStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `guiltTripStateList`, all finance tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add typ/Expense ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire GuiltTrip.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
