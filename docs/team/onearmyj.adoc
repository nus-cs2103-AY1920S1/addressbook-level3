== PROJECT: Plan²travel
The purpose of this document is to document the contribution that I have made in the project: *_Plan²travel_* as a student
undertaking the module CS2103T under NUS School of Computing.

== Introduction

*Plan²travel* is a desktop travel planning application. The application is targeted at fellow university students who
travel infrequently and would greatly benefit from an application that helps organize their travelling information when they plan their own itinerary. Plan²travel has the ability to store and display information such as activities, accommodations, contacts and an itinerary which comprises of a list of day. Each day is displayed with a list of activities that is scheduled. +

The user interacts with the application using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has Graphical User Interface GUI created with JavaFX.

It is cross-platform and can be compiled for both Windows and Mac OS.

Below is a screenshot of our application:

== Summary of contributions
|===
|Below is a summary of the contributions that I have made to the project.
|===

=== *Major enhancement*: +
* *Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** *What it does:* allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by
using the redo command.
[NOTE]
Only undoable commands can be undone by the 'undo' command.

** *Justification:* This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the
app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** *Highlights:* This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Functional Code Contributed*: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/112[Update 1] |
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/127[Update 2] | https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/133[Update 3]

| https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/269[Final Update]

* *Test Code Contributed*: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/277[Test 1] | https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/280[Test 2]


=== *Minor enhancement*: +
* *Morph original code base for Model and Storage package*
** *What I did:* I modified the entire model package from the original code base and added new model class files, such
as Accommodation, Activity and Contact. I also remove traces of unused codes from the previous code base. Aside
morphing model, I also morphed the storage package, allowing the application's data to be saved into 4 different json
data files instead.

** *Justification*: Morphing has to be done to the old code base in order to fit the goals of our application. Once
the code base is morphed, the team is able to proceed with implementing their individual features of the application.

** *Highlights*: I gained a deeper understanding of how the different components of the code base worked, especially
for storage component. With the insights gained, I was able to advise my teammates on how they should approach their
implementations when working with these components.

* *Functional Code Contributed*: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-1/main/pull/68[Update 1] |
