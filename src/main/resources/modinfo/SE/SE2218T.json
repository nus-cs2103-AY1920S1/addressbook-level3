    "description": "The Southeast Asian economies and the region as a whole have experienced a significant change in their economic landscapes in terms of high growth rates, rising income levels, improvement in the standards of living, and the changing structures of production and trade. What accounts for this transformation? We seek to answer this question by examining the experiences and problems of the various Southeast Asian economies in the context of the leading development models and policies that they have pursued in promoting and developing their domestic sectors (agriculture, manufacturing and services) and external sectors (trade, foreign capital and regionalism).",
