    "description": "Framed around the production of non-fiction short films, Creating 'Reality' explores the visual representation of factual material. The intellectual core of the module focuses on the complexities of visual approaches to data collection and narrative, especially when observing and depicting real life practices, stories, and behaviours. In the module, non-fiction film is used as tool to explore critical issues of the nature of reality, subjectivity/objectivity, selection bias, and the manipulation of data \u2013 which are broad based concerns in all academic disciplines. The module draws upon literature from a wide range of disciplines from visual anthropology and new media, to film studies to contextualize the diversity of theoretical and practical approaches involved in creating non-fiction film. The module utilizes practical learning exercises, including the group production of a short documentary film about some aspect of current events, or everyday life in Singapore.",
