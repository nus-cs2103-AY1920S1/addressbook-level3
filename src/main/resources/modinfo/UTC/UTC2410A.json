    "description": "This module explores the concepts and practices of post-conflict community reconstruction in the successor states of ex-Yugoslavia. It focuses on the rebuilding of trust and cooperation between Serbs, Croats and Bosnias/Muslims in several new nation-states after the wars and genocides of the 1990s. It offers students an interactive learning opportunity that combines development and conflict/peace theories, classroom discussions in Singapore, and a study trip. Students will critically examine debates about rebuilding communities, as well as the ethical, social, and economic challenges of community development and reconstruction.",
