== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is an application designed for treasurers of student co-curricular activities (CCAs)/student clubs
who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*. More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who
prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

[[Features]]
== Features
This section contains details on the features in the treasurerPro.
These features are divided primarily into two categories:

* Universal commands available within all tabs
* Commands specific within each tab

Universal commands are displayed first. Tab-specific commands are organised according to the
tabs that they belong to.

====
*General Command Format for All Tabs*

* Highlighted words, like `add n/John Doe` or `add n/NAME` indicate that they can be entered into the Command Box.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

== Universal Commands for All Tabs

These are commands available for use in the Command Box for all tabs.

=== Navigation Between Tabs
Command: `go TAB`

This command allows you to navigate between tabs.

* `go home`
* `go members`
* `go inventory`
* `go reimbursements`
* `go cashier`
* `go overview`

Alternatively, you may also choose to click the tabs to switch to them.

=== Exiting the Application
Command: `exit`

This command allows you to exit the application immediately.
Alternatively, you may also click the `x` button on the top right (for Windows/Linux) or top left (for macOS) to close
the application.

=== Undo/Redo the Last Command `[coming in v2.0]`
Command: `undo` or `redo`

This command allows you undo/redo the last command.

== Application Tab Specific Commands

These are commands that are specific to each tab within treasurerPro.

=== Home Tab
This section will contain details on all commands available in the Home tab.

====
*Summary of features in the Home Tab*

* The Home Tab shows a list of all transactions made thus far.
* Each column shows the date, description, category, amount spent and the person responsible for each transaction.
* You may add, delete or edit transactions within this tab.
* Leo, our mascot, helps give replies indicating successful commands executed.
* Leo will also give replies to guide you when there is a wrong input.
* You may also sort the list of transactions by descending date, by ascending alphabetical order or descending amount.
* The amount input for a transaction should be positive if the transaction is considered revenue to the club (that is,
it adds money to the club's funds).
* The amount input should be negative if the transaction is an expenditure made by the club (that is, it deducts money
from the club's funds).
* Description and category of a transaction can be empty.

[WARNING]
The amount you may enter is limited to -999999.99 to 999999.99. If more decimal points are entered, it will be rounded
off to 2 decimal points.

====

==== To Add a Transaction in the Home Tab
This command allows you to add a transaction to the table and saves it into the system.

* Command:
`add dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

* Example
** [blue]`add dt/24-Aug-2019 d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Alex Yeoh`

[NOTE]
The format of the date has to be in dd-MMM-yyyy format and is case-sensitive. (Eg. 24-Aug-2019 or 03-Sep-2019)
The person specified must already exist in the Members tab and is case-sensitive.
While all field prefixes must be present, the description and category can still be empty.

[WARNING]
If you are adding a transaction meant to represent sales revenue, the transaction *must* be positive-valued
and under the "Sales" category for it to show up in the Overview Tab correctly.
If you are adding a transaction that is considered a spending which requires reimbursement to the member, the transaction
*must* be negative-valued for it to show up in Reimbursements tab automatically.

* Steps

1. Type the command with all parameters filled in, as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the user input into the Command Box for Add Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep1cr.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`. If the command is successfully added, Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction
will be shown in the table. This is shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for Add Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeAddStep2cr.png[]

[[NoSuchPerson]]
If the person's name does not exactly match a current member in the Members Tab, Leo will respond with an error and the
transaction record will not be added.

[NOTE]
There is no character limit for the description or category. If the words appear truncated, the columns in the table can
be expanded by dragging the right border of the column. Just be careful not to resize the column to the point that it
exceeds the width of the window, which would require restarting treasurerPro to restore the column back to the original
size. Alternatively, you may click on the row to have the full details of the transaction displayed as a response from
Leo.

After step 2, if the added transaction contains a negative amount (indicating an expenditure), a corresponding entry will
automatically be shown in the Reimbursement tab, tagged to the member who spent it. +
Since reimbursements are aggregated by member, if the member already has other outstanding reimbursements,
it will simply be added to his existing row. +
This is shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the Reimbursement Tab after successfully adding a transaction
image::homeUG/HomeAddShowInR.png[width = "700"]

==== To Delete Transactions in the Home Tab
This command allows you to delete either all transactions of a person or a single transaction of a specific ID from the
table.

* Command
`delete ID` or `delete p/PERSON`

* Examples
** Delete by ID: [blue]`delete 1` - Deletes the transaction at the index shown in the table. If the table shows a
filtered list of transactions due to the Find command detailed in <<findCommandHome, Section 5.1.5 To Find Transactions
that Match Keywords in the Home Tab>>, the 1st transaction in the filtered list is deleted.
** Delete by Person: [blue]`delete p/Alex Yeoh` - Deletes all transactions of the person in full list of transactions.

* Steps for Deleting by ID:
1. Type the command with the ID of the transaction to be deleted as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the user input into Command Box for Delete by ID command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeleteStep1cr.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`. Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction will be removed from the table as shown below:

.Screenshot of a successful user input for Delete by ID Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeleteStep2cr.png[]

* Steps for Deleting by Person:
1. Type the command with the person's name to delete all transactions related to that person, as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of a user input into Command Box for Delete by ID command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeletePStep1cr.png[]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`. Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction(s) will be removed from the table as shown
in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for Delete by Person Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeDeletePStep2cr.png[]

For both Delete commands, if the transaction(s) deleted was part of a pending reimbursement record, it will also be
removed from that reimbursement record. +
On the other hand, if the person entered is not part of our database as shown
in the Members Tab, Leo will respond with a message to inform you. +
If the person does not have any transactions, Leo will also respond with a message to inform you.

==== To Edit a Transaction in the Home Tab
This command allows you to edit an existing transaction in the table and change its details.

* Command:
`edit ID [dt/DATE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [c/CATEGORY] [a/AMOUNT] [p/PERSON]`

[NOTE]
The optional fields above can vary in their order. It is not compulsory to include all of them but you need to
include at least one.

* Examples:
** [blue]`edit 1 p/Bernice Yu dt/23-Aug-2019` - Edits the transaction at the index shown in the table. If the table shows a filtered
list of transactions due to the Find command detailed in <<findCommandHome, Section 5.1.5 To Find Transactions that Match Keywords in the Home Tab>>,
the 1st transaction in the filtered list is edited.

* Steps:
1. Type the command with the ID of the transaction to be edited, along with the new parameters to be changed, as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of user input into Command Box for Edit Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeEditStep1cr.png[]

[NOTE]
Similar to the Add command, there is no restriction to the number of characters allowed for the description and
category.

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`.

Leo will respond with a success message and the updated transaction will be shown in the table as shown below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for Edit Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeEditStep2cr.png[]


If the person entered into the command is not found in the Members tab, Leo will respond to inform you which is similar to <<NoSuchPerson, Add command>>.
In addition, if there is no matching transactions, en empty table will be shown.

==== To Sort Transactions in Different Orders
This command enables you to sort the table of transactions into a specified order for viewing and carrying out of subsequent commands.

* To sort:
** By date (from oldest to most recent): [blue]`sort date`
** By name (from alphabetical order of name): [blue]`sort name`
** By amount (from smallest to largest in amount): [blue]`sort amount`
** Undo sort: [blue]`sort reset`

* Examples:
** [blue]`find Alex` +
[blue]`sort date` - Sorts both the results of the [blue]`find` command shown and the actual transaction list. The Find command is detailed
in <<findCommandHome, Section 5.1.5. To Find Transactions that Match Keywords in the Home tab>>. To view the full sorted list,
enter [blue]`back` command which is detailed in <<homeBackCommand, Section 5.1.6. To Go Back to Display the Full List in the Home Tab>>


[NOTE]
The Undo Sort command allows you to view the table of transactions in the order originally shown when the application was initially opened.
The list can be sorted even if it is empty.

* Steps
1. Type any one of the above commands in blue font into the command box.

2. Hit `Enter`. The table will now be sorted in the specified order for you.

[[findCommandHome]]
==== To Find Transactions that Match Keywords in the Home Tab
This command transactions matching the specified keywords for viewing and for carrying out of subsequent commands,
based on the filtered table of transactions shown. The subsequent commands will include: delete, edit and sort.

[NOTE]
An Add command after a Find command will cause the table to show all transactions. A Find command will always
find from the full list transactions and show the results.

* Command:
`find KEYWORDS`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `alex` will match `Alex`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Alex Yeoh` will match `Yeoh Alex`
* Only the date, person, description, category of the transaction can be searched for.
* Only full words (no whitespaces) will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`, `24-Aug` will not match `24-Aug-2019`
* Transactions matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

* Examples:
** [blue]`find Alex Yeoh`
** [blue]`find Alex`

* Steps:

Shown below is the table of all transactions:

//.Screenshot of all transactions in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindCurr.png[width = "700"]

1. Type the command with keyword(s) to find transactions as shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of the user input into Command Box for Find Command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep1cr.png[]


[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`. Leo will respond with the number of matching transactions, and the table will show only
transactions matching the keywords. This is shown in the screenshot below:

//.Screenshot of a successful user input for find command in Home tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep2.png[width = "700"]


[start = 3]
3. Key in [blue]`back` and hit `Enter` to return to the table of all transactions, or enter your next command to be executed.
The screenshot below shows the Edit command being input as the next command:

//.Screenshot of the user input for Edit Command according to filtered table's ID in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep3cr.png[]


The table will continue to show the filtered table with the transaction edited according to the command, shown in the screenshot above.
[NOTE]
As mentioned, if an Add command is entered, the table will automatically reverse back to the previous view to show the full list of all transactions.
All other commands require you to input [blue]`back` to return to the full list of all transactions.

The screenshot below shows the table after entering [blue]`back` which shows all the transactions in the table again:

//.Screenshot of the user input for Back command after entering Find command in Home Tab
image::homeUG/HomeFindStep3Back.png[width="700"]

[[homeBackCommand]]
==== To Go Back to Display the Full List in the Home Tab
This command helps you to display the full transaction list after Find Commands. After a Find Command, you can enter Delete, Edit or Sort Commands
before entering the Back Command to display the full list.

[NOTE]
There is no need for you to enter a Back command after an Add Command since the Add command automatically resets the
table to show the full list of transactions.

*Summary of features in the Reimbursement Tab*

* The reimbursement tab displays all the reimbursements that need to be paid out by the treasurer.

* Each reimbursement contains:
** The person's name
** The total amount the person needs to be reimbursed
** The description of the transactions related to the person and deadline for that reimbursement.

* Reimbursement records are automatically extracted from the transactions history.
* The reimbursement list aggregates transactions by person and displays only one row per person.

* You can add a deadline to a reimbursement, find a reimbursement by name, mark a reimbursement as done
and sort the reimbursements.

* All reimbursements shown in the Reimbursement Tab are outstanding and have not been paid. Completed reimbursements will not be displayed.

====

[NOTE]
Reimbursements constitute only transactions resulting in an outflow of cash. This is represented by a negative amount
in a transaction, and means that the person tagged to that transaction had paid first, and needs to be reimburesd
for their expenditure.

==== Adding Deadline to a Reimbursement:

This command allows you to add a deadline to a person's reimbursement.

[WARNING]
You can set the deadline as any valid day you want.
It is your responsibility to set a reasonable deadline.

If an invalid format is inputted, e.g. `01-AAA-2019` or `19-DEC-2019` or `-1-Dec-2019`,
Leo will inform you that the input is invalid. +

If an invalid date is entered, e.g. `31-Feb-2019`, the app will round it  to `28-Feb-2019`
and adds the rounded date as the deadline. But our app only checks up to `31` in day.

====
*Summary of Features of the Cashier Tab*

* The Cashier tab allows you to key in, calculate and record the items sold from the inventory.
* To key in an item, it must first be recorded in the Inventory tab.
* The columns of this tab will show the description of the item being sold, the price per quantity, the total quantity selected
and the subtotal for that row of items.
* The bottom row will display the name of the cashier who is in-charge of the sales, as well as the total amount of all
the sales items in the table.
* At the side, just like other tabs, our mascot lion 'Leo' will reply to indicate successful addition, deletion and
update of items.
* Upon wrong inputs, Leo will prompt you and guide you along to key in the correct inputs.
* Upon successful checkout, the Inventory tab will be immediately updated with the remaining stock left in
the inventory.
* After every checkout, the sales made will be recorded as one transaction which will be then labelled as "Items sold"
under the category "Sales" and person will be the cashier-in-charge. The Home tab will be updated with this transaction.
* Whenever there are items on the cart, `Cashier Mode` will automatically be turned on. When `Cashier Mode` is turned on, you cannot
make any modification to existing items in the inventory except for the adding of new items.

[NOTE]
Items with zero price are not available for sale. Such items cannot be added into the table.

[WARNING]
Due to size limitation, you will not be allowed to add any items into the table if the total amount exceeds $999999.99. You
are advised to reduce the quantity of items or checkout separately in another cart.

[NOTE]
The description and category are case-insensitive. Regardless of the case, as long as the description matches, it can be added to the cart.

====

==== Add a Sales Item to the Table
This command enables you to add a sales item into the table.

* Command:
`add [c/CATEGORY] d/DESCRIPTION q/QUANTITY`

The quantity that you input must be less than or equal to the stock available in the Inventory tab.
The category field is optional. If you are unsure about the description of the desired item, you can refer to
the Inventory tab or simply key in the category without any other fields. Leo will display all the items in the
specified category that are available for sale.

If you input a description of an item that already exists in the inventory, the quantity inputted will be added to
the existing quantity. If the total quantity exceed the stock available, the system will warn you and prohibit such addition.

Additionally, if the description is misspelled or does not match any of the items in the inventory, Leo will recommend
items with similar description that you might be looking for.

* Examples:

** [blue]`add c/food` - Displays all items that are under the 'food' category in the response box
** [blue]`add c/stationary d/pancake q/3` - Adds 3 similar items which have the description "pancake"
** [blue]`add d/pancake q/3` - Adds 3 similar items which have the description "pancake"


[NOTE]
The items will only be displayed according to the category in the response box if both description and quantity fields are not specified
and the category field is valid.
If both description and quantity are specified but description is invalid, *only suggestions* will be shown in the response box
according to the mistyped description.

[NOTE]
If both category and description are specified and valid, the system will allow the item to be added according the
description even if the category of the item does *not* match with the specified category inputted.

* Steps:

1. If you do not remember the exact description of the item to add, you can type the command "add" with a category
specified as shown in the screenshot below.
