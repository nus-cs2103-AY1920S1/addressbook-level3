    "description": "Bio-medicine and biotechnology are rapidly progressing technologies in the 21st century. Who carries responsibility for debating the ethical use of these innovations \u2013 national committees, or everyday citizens? Debating bioethics requires some knowledge of three areas: bio-medicine and biotechnology themselves, theories of ethics, and methods of logical reasoning with regards to the ethical applications of the technologies to people at different stages of life. We will explore issues running from the beginning of human life (such as cloning), throughout life (such as biological enhancements) and at life\u2019s end (such as the ethics of assisted death).",
