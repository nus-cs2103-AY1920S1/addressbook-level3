    "description": "Organisational Psychology is the study of human behaviour in the workplace, and all the factors that affect human behaviour. This course aims to provide a theoretical and practical overview of individual (e.g., emotions, decision-making), team (e.g., team dynamics, leadership), and organisational (e.g., organisational structure, culture) processes in the workplace and how these processes interact with one another in dynamic ways. We will grow our appreciation of how people behave, think about, influence, and interact with each other at work to effectuate outcomes such as employee motivation and job performance.",
