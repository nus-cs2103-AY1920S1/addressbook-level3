    "description": "Genetic engineering (or genetic modification, transgenic) is to modify genetic\nmaterials of living things according to human\u2019s will. Is it beneficial or harmful?\nAre you aware of GMO (genetically modified organism) and GM food? Do you\nwant to favour or oppose these GM products? Should we modify the gene for\ncuring genetic diseases? Is it acceptable to use genetically modified animals for\norgan transplantation to human? Do you know that genetic modification can\nactually help to save the environment? This module will help students to\nunderstand the science behind genetic engineering and thus students can\nmake educated answers to the above questions. There are plenty of examples\nof genetic engineering and each student needs to choose one or few examples\nand try to understand how these products have been created; their benefits and\npotential hazards, if any, will be discussed in the class.",
