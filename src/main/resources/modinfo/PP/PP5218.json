    "description": "This course examines the intersection of Public Policy and Futures Studies. The course will develop an understanding of how anticipatory practices can support public policy. A methodological overview of futures research and studies and hands on knowledge of the Singapore Government\u2019s Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning (RAHS) system, as well as other futures research tools and methods are given. Case studies of policy-foresight programs will be comprehensively surveyed. A theoretical understanding of the convergence of public policy and futures studies is developed. Emerging issues in public policy (eGoveCitizen, Sino-global dynamics, alternative futures of globalization and policy) are explored.",
