    "description": "For the most dedicated instrumental performers, participation in international competition is a significant milestone in their professional development. This module is designed to offer space and support for actual participation, with the assessment mirroring the requirements of the competition itself. Students taking this module would normally have a specific competition in mind. Details of assessment, while generically similar to each other, can be tailored more specifically to the competition involved. It is anticipated that students will generally be needing to prepare a minimum of an hour of competition material.",
