== Introduction

This document details various aspects of the implementation of the _KeyboardFlashCards_ application. It serves as
a guide for any software developer who wishes to maintain or add on to the project - as such, it is extremely
detailed and technical, and a certain degree of expertise may be required to fully understand everything here.

_KeyboardFlashCards_ (KFC) is a desktop flashcard manager application. It is primarily targeted at university
undergraduates, particularly computing students. As such, it is optimized for users who prefer to work with a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The application is written entirely in the Java programming language, with a GUI implemented using JavaFX. Its code base
currently contains an approximate 25 KLoC.

The following admonitions will occasionally appear throughout this document; you may wish to take note of them.
Here is what each of them means:

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section will show you the designs for varies component of _KeyboardFlashCards_.
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same question as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width = "600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CategoryListPane`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashCardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `DeadlineListPane` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width = "600"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FlashCardsParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashCard).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width = "600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the KeyboardFlashCards' data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<FlashCard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Category` list in `KeyboardFlashCards`, which `FlashCard` can reference. This would allow `KeyboardFlashCards` to only require one `Category` object per unique `Category`, instead of each `Flashcard` needing their own `Category` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[width = "300"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width = "600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the KeyboardFlashCards data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//@@author shutingy
// tag::addflashcard[]
=== Add feature
==== Implementation

The add feature allows the user to add flashcard with compulsory field of `QUESTION` and `ANSWER`. `CATEGORY` is optional fields which the user can add to the flashcard later using the `edit` feature.

[NOTE]
Following are the prefixes for each field: +
- q> : `QUESTION` +
- a> : `ANSWER` +
- c> : `CATEGORY`

Given below is an example usage scenario of `add` :

The user executes `add q>1+1 a>2 c>math` to add new flashcard.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]


The add feature does not allow adding of duplicate FlashCards.
If the FlashCard exists in the storage, an error will be shown.

[NOTE]
Duplicate FlashCards refers to FlashCards that have the exact same question and answer.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

image::AddActivityDiagram.png[width="300"]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement add

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Use command `add` together with
prefixes like `q>`, `a>` and `c>`
** pros: Easier to implement and easier to process the data.
** cons: User might miss the prefixes hence adding wrong FlashCards
* **Alternative 2:** Make use of the GUI. After user execute `add` command,
 an **add flash card window** would pop up and there is segment for individual fields.
** pros: More user friendly and void user input error.
** cons: Harder to implement.

NOTE: **Alternative 1** was preferred as we have constraints using command line interface.
In addition, there was limited time.

// tag::deadline[]

=== Add and Remove Deadline feature
==== Implementation

The deadline feature allows the user to add tasks with specific due dates, with a compulsory field
of `TASK` and `DUE DATE`.

The following are new classes used to integrate the Deadline feature.

* `Deadline` -- Object class, containing important information such as the `Task` and `DueDate`.
* `UniqueDeadlineList` -- Contains a `ObservableList` of `Deadline` objects. The list will be initialised from the storage
at start up of application. A `Comparator` class was added to arrange the list according to ascending `DueDate`.
* `DeadlineCommand` --  Embodies the `Deadline` command by the user. It will hold all the information about
the `Deadline` that will be added.
* `DeadlineCommandParser` -- Parses user input and uses it to construct a `DeadlineCommand` instance.
* `RemoveCommand` --  Holds information on which `Deadline` to be removed. Contains an `Index` object.
* `RemoveCommandParser` -- Parses user input and uses it to construct a `RemoveCommand` instance.

In addition, various Exception classes are added to handle possible runtime errors while adding or removing `Deadline`.
This is done to ensure that the user specified `Deadline` is valid for storage and processing.

* `DuplicateDeadlineException` -- This exception is thrown when the user attempts to add an identical `Deadline` object
is added into the existing `UniqueDeadlineList`.
* `DeadlineNotFoundException` -- This exception is thrown when the user attempts to remove a `Deadline` object that does
not exist in the `UniqueDeadlineList`.

For the add `Deadline` feature - `deadline`, the following are the prefixes for each field +
- t> : `TASK` +
- d> : `DUE DATE`
- For `DUE DATE` : Date format must be in dd/MM/yyyy
i.e. 01/01/2020

NOTE: The upper cased `Deadline` represents the object class that contains `Task` and `DueDate`, while the lower-cased
`deadline` represents the command used to add `Deadline` objects into our storage.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `deadline` command:

The user executes `deadline t>Complete Homework d>04/10/2020` to add new deadline to the task
of completing homework by the 4th October 2020.

NOTE: The deadline feature does not allow adding of duplicate/identical deadlines. Also, new deadlines must
be later than the current date.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deadline operation works:

image::DeadlineSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a deadline command:

image::DeadlineActivityDiagram.png[width=320,height=480]

The `remove` command works in a similar way, and hence the Sequence and Activity diagrams will be omitted for redundancy.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement Deadline

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Use command `deadline` together with
prefixes like `t>` and `d>`
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: User might miss the prefixes hence adding wrong deadlines
* **Alternative 2:** Make use of the GUI. after user execute `deadline` command,
 an **add deadline window** would pop up with a section for individual fields
** Pros: More user friendly
** Cons: Difficult to implement. Might be slower for the user to key in deadlines as compared to using a one liner with prefixes

// end::deadline[]

//@@author dalsontws
// tag::badflashcard[]

=== Bad FlashCard feature
==== Implementation

The `bad` feature allows the user to rate specific `FlashCards` as 'bad' if they did not perform well on them.
These rated FlashCards will then we stored as a `Deadline` dated 3 days later, where the user will then be reminded to
re-test them.

This is a simple implementation of a type of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education[evidence-based]
learning technique known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Spaced Repetition]. This is used as a form of
active recall technique which is said to overcome forgetting, theorised by Hermann Ebbinghaus, and his theory of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve[Forgetting Curve].

The following are new classes used to integrate the "Bad" `FlashCard` feature.

* `BadQuestions` -- Main object class for the feature. Makes use of a `HashMap` of key-value pairing of a Date `String`
that is converted to a `LocalDate` class as the key, and the value is a `ArrayList` of `FlashCards`. This allows ease of
search for "Bad" rated `FlashCards` based on the date stored.
* `BadCommand` -- Contains a `ObservableList` of `Deadline` objects. The list will be initialised from the storage
at start up of application. A `Comparator` class was added to arrange the list according to ascending `DueDate`.
* `ListBadCommand` --  Embodies the `Deadline` command by the user. It will hold all the information about
the `Deadline` that will be added.
* `RemoveBadCommand` -- Parses user input and uses it to construct a `DeadlineCommand` instance.

In addition, two Exception classes are added to handle possible runtime errors while adding new "Bad" `FlashCards`.
This is done to ensure that the user specified "Bad" `FlashCard` is valid for storage and processing.

* `NoBadFlashCardException` -- This exception is thrown when the user attempts to add an identical `Deadline` object
is added into the existing `UniqueDeadlineList`.
* `DuplicateFlashCardAndDeadlineException` -- This exception is thrown when the user attempts to add an identical `Deadline` object
is added into the existing `UniqueDeadlineList`.

[NOTE]
Following are the prefixes for each field: +
- `bad INDEX` +
i.e. bad 2

Given below is an example usage scenario of `bad INDEX` :

The user executes `bad 2` to rate the second `FlashCard` in the list as "Bad".

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How to store "Bad" FlashCard in storage

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Use a `HashMap` with the specified date as the key. Store `FlashCard` as an
`ArrayList`. Use of the Google Gson library to save and fetch `HashMap` from and to Json format.
** Pros: Easier for searching and sorting purposes, as entire `FlashCard` object is stored and easily
referred using the date as key. Can fetch more than just the answer of the `FlashCard`
** Cons: Separated from the `FlashCard` `UniqueFlashCardList`, which might confuse the user
* **Alternative 2:** Use similar implementation as how `FlashCard` and `Deadline` objects are stored in storage;
use a `ObservableList` that can be displayed in GUI.
** Pros: Easier to implement, clearer for user to see
** Cons: Difficult to manipulate in the future, especially when we want to implement

=== Exporting/Importing of FlashCards

==== About

Our application currently supports the exporting of `FlashCards` to two file formats ('.docx' and '.json'), and importing of `FlashCards` from one
file format ('.json'). Through these features, a user can easily transfer their _KFC_ data to an external file, and another user
can just as easily transfer the same data back into their own copy of _KFC_.

==== Implementation

The Export/Import feature is primarily facilitated by the following classes:

* `ExportCommand` -- Embodies an `export` command by the user; carries information about which `FlashCards` are to be exported, and to where
* `ExportCommandParser` -- Parses user input and uses it to construct an `ExportCommand` instance
* `ImportCommand` -- Embodies an `import` command by the user; carries information about where `FlashCards` are to be imported from
* `ImportCommandParser` -- Parses user input and uses it to construct an `ImportCommand` instance
* `ExportPath` -- Represents the path to a specific file - either absolute or relative to the application directory
* `ExportPathFactory` -- Parses the user-provided file path and creates instances of `ExportPath`

NOTE: The "export" in `ExportPath` is to be taken as a noun, not a verb. An `ExportPath`, therefore, is not the path that we export to, but the
path of an export. `ExportPaths` are used in both exporting and importing of files.

`ExportPath` is an abstract class that follows the factory pattern. Each subclass of `ExportPath` represents the path to a specific file of a
specific extension (e.g. an instance of `DocumentPath` represents the path to a specific document). Instances of these subclasses are created by
`ExportPathFactory#getExportPath(String)`, which determines the appropriate subclass to create based on the extension of the provided file path String.
Once created, an `ExportPath` will expose the following relevant methods:

* `getPath()` -- Returns a Java `Path` object that represents this `ExportPath`
* `export(List<FlashCard> list)` -- Exports the given `List` of `FlashCards` to the file path embodied by this `ExportPath`
* `importFrom()` -- Attempts to import `FlashCards` from the file path represented by this `ExportPath`

CAUTION: Not all `ExportPath` subclasses will implement the `importFrom()` method. `DocumentPath`, for example, does not.

Because `ExportPath` follows the factory pattern, any class that deals with `ExportPath` or its subclasses need not know which particular subclass it is
dealing with exactly. Each `ExportPath` subclass will implement its own `export` and `import` methods, which, when called, will perform the required operations
without any further hassle. Of course, due to the Separation of Concerns principle, the `ExportPath` subclasses will not handle these directly.
Instead, they will delegate the work to other utility classes, which, in turn, interface with the external libraries necessary to complete the task.
TIP: The exporting/importing functionality is extremely easy to extend - you can add support for a new format simply through the creation of new subclasses of `ExportPath`.

NOTE: You can find all relevant classes in the `seedu.address.model.export` package. The only exceptions are `ExportCommand`, `ImportCommand`, `ExportCommandParser`, and `ImportCommandParser`, which can be found in the `seedu.address.logic` package.

The following table shows the classes and methods that you may have to deal with when exporting to or importing from each format:

image::ExportDgTable.png[width="75%"]

_Table 1: Overview of classes and methods involved in the Export/Import feature_

The number of classes supporting the Export/Import feature is rather large. These classes also span more than one
package in the application. The following class diagram will help you to better understand the associations and relationships
between these classes:

==== Design considerations

|===
|_This section describes some of the design considerations that went into the implementation of this feature._
|===

===== Aspect: Implementation of exporting functionality for different file formats

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a single `export` command - leave file formats to be handled by underlying classes
** Pros: Is easier for user to remember; can easily be extended to support additional file formats
** Cons: Is harder to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Have a separate command for exporting to each format (e.g. `exportdoc`, `exportjson`, etc.)
** Pros: Is easier to implement
** Cons: Results in user having more commands to remember; new commands must be added to support new file formats

NOTE: **Alternative 1** was preferred for its ease of extensibility.

===== Aspect: Method of obtaining desired `FlashCards` for exporting

* **Alternative 1:** Update the `Model` to show all desired `FlashCards`, then export all of said `FlashCards`
** Pros: Is easy to implement as it makes use of existing logic in `Model`; user receives immediate visual feedback regarding which specific `FlashCards` were exported
** Cons: May cause confusion - name of `export` command does not imply that the selected `FlashCards` will also be shown to the user
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement a new method in `Model` that returns the selected `FlashCards`, without updating the on-screen list
** Pros: Will not cause confusion to user - `export` command does exactly what one would expect it to do
** Cons: Is harder to implement and might result in duplication of logic

NOTE: **Alternative 2** was preferred as it provides users with an experience closer to what they would expect.

=== Test mode
Test mode allows users to start a flash card test from a selected list of tags. If no parameters are provided, all
flashcards contained in the system will be tested.

The following activity diagram shows the typical scenario of a `FlashCard` test. Note that special commands such as
`skip` and `end` are omitted for brevity.

image::TestModeActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

==== Implementation
This feature is supported by the following classes:

* `KeyboardFlashCardsParser` to control the flow of command in the entire program
* `StartCommandParser` to parse arguments for StartCommand
* `ModelManager` which stores `FlashCardTestModel`, an aggregation of `FlashCards`, to be used for test mode
* `CategoryContainsAnyKeywordsPredicate` to search and generate a list of `FlashCards` with relevant tags
* `StartCommand` to set the application to test mode, starting the `FlashCard` test
* `ShowAnswerCommand` allows the user to view the answer to the `FlashCard` currently tested
* `NextQuestionCommand` is an abstract class that allows its subclasses to fetch the next `FlashCard`
* `RateQuestionCommand` extends `NextQuestionCommand`, and allows the users to rate the `FlashCard`
* `SkipQuestionCommand` extends `NextQuestionCommand`, and allows the users to skip the question
* `EndTestCommand` allows the use to end the test mode anytime, enabling normal commands such as `listall`

The following class diagram shows the structure of the `StartCommand` class.
The class diagrams for other test commands are omitted due to similarities.

image::StartCommandClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

The following sequence diagram shows the intended case for the `start` command:

image::StartSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600"]

==== Design considerations
Aspect: Data structure to support `FlashCardTestModel`:

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `LinkedList` implementation:
** Pros: Very efficient, with O(1) complexity removing the head of the list every time a question is tested
** Cons: Less memory efficient than `ArrayList`
* **Alternative 2:** ArrayList implementation:
** Pros: More memory efficient than `LinkedList`
** Cons: To obtain the same performance as `LinkedList`, the last index/size of the `ArrayList` has to be constantly tracked.
This slightly decreases code readability compared to the `LinkedList` implementation.
* **Alternative 3:** Queue interface:
** Pros: Use of `Queue` interface brings simplicity to code structure and readability while having the same performance
as a `LinkedList` implementation
** Cons: Potential coupling by using `Queue` instead of `List` interface

NOTE: **Alternative 1** is preferred due to better readability while maintaining O(1) efficiency, i.e. `remove(0)`
instead of `remove(list.size() - 1)` in `ArrayList` to remove either ends of the list.

Aspect: Hiding of the list of `FlashCards` during test mode:

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Adding a new scene in test mode:
** Pros: No need to mutate the `ObservableList` to hide the `FlashCards` as the
new scene is layered on top of it
** Cons: Use of multiple scenes will be needed, hence the implementation will be slightly complicated
* **Alternative 2:** Hiding and showing `FlashCards` by changing `ObservableList`:
** Pros: Simple to implement
** Cons: Potentially interferes with other functions, such as the updating of statistics

NOTE: **Alternative 1** is preferred as it does not interfere with the `ObservableList` to hide/show
the list of `FlashCards`, hence reducing the potential for bugs and side-effects.

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics feature
The statistics feature allows users to view the overall statistics in a single pop-up window.

==== Implementation
This feature is supported by the following classes:

* `StatsCommand` -- Carries the message to be displayed to the user.
* `MainWindow` -- Opens a specific window as required.
* `StatsWindow` -- Builds the statistics window display.
* `Model` -- To provide a list of FlashCards given a rating predicate and the statistics from test mode.
* `Stage` -- To create the pop-up window.
* `Scene` -- To create an object that contains all the physical contents of the pop-up window.
* `FlowPane` -- To create the layout of the pop-up window.

The sequence diagram below shows how the statistics operation works.

image::StatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600"]

The sequence diagram below details how these other classes (i.e. `Stage`, `Scene` and `FlowPane`) work with `StatsWindow` to create the statistics pop-up window.

image::StatisticsShow.png[width="600"]

The activity diagram below summarizes what happens when a user executes the `stats` command.

image::StatisticsActivityDiagram.png[width="300"]


==== Design considerations
The following aspect was a consideration when designing the statistics feature.

Aspect: Methods to collect statistics

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Collect total number of good/hard/easy flashcards using predicates and those completed in test mode using the model.
** Pros: This is easy to implement.
** Cons: This requires extra lines of code to combine all the statistics.


* **Alternative 2:** Collect all statistics using the model.
** Pros: This allows the collection of all statistics with minimal methods involved.
** Cons: This requires constant updating of the model when new FlashCards are added, removed or edited.

Alternative 1 was chosen simply because it was easier to implement within the given period of time.

// end::statistics[]

// tag::help[]
=== Help feature
The help feature allows a user to refer to a summary of commands supported by the application.

==== Implementation
This feature is supported by the following classes:

* `HelpCommand` -- Carries the message to be displayed to the user.
* `MainWindow` -- Opens a specific window as required.
* `HelpWindow` -- Builds the help window display.
* `Image` -- To convert a png file into an `Image` object.
* `ImageView` -- To convert an `Image` object into a view.
* `Stage` -- To display the view.

The sequence diagram below shows how the help operation works.

image::HelpSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]

The sequence diagram below details how these other classes (i.e. `Stage`, `Image` and `ImageView`) work with `HelpWindow` to create the help pop-up window.

image::HelpShow.png[width="600"]

The activity diagram below summarizes what happens when a user executes the `help` command.

image::HelpActivityDiagram.png[width="300"]


==== Design considerations
The following aspect was a consideration when designing the help feature.


Aspect: Ways to display the command summary

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Display a snapshot with all the commands supported by the application.
** Pros: The display can be quickly ammended with any addition or removal of command(s).
** Cons: The size of the snapshot displayed needs to be large to ensure sufficient picture resolution.


* **Alternative 2:** Display as text.
** Pros: This results in a higher-resolution display of the command summary.
** Cons: This requires changing the code.


Alternative 1 was chosen simply because it was easier to update the displayed command summary.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
