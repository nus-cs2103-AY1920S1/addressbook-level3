    "description": "There is a strong belief in physics that the most important laws of nature are the ones governing at the smallest length scales-- the laws of anything larger are merely their corollaries. This course explores how \u2018emergence\u2019 challenges this worldview. Emergence is the thesis that laws governing macroscopic objects are often so different and unpredictable based on the underlying microscopic ones that the two sets of laws are in fact equally fundamental and conceptually distinct. Macroscopic higher level laws are then said to \u2018emerge\u2019 from the microscopic lower level ones. We will examine concrete examples from thermodynamics, mechanics and optics.",
