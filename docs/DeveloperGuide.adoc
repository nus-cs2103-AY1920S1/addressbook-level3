== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data, in the form of a stateful address book which maintains a list of address books as states.
* stores the list of previously entered commands, in the form of a `CommandHistory` object.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Policy>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::merging[]
=== Merging Feature
==== Implementation

The merging mechanism is facilitated by abstract classes `MergeCommand`, `DoNotMergeCommand`, `MergeConfirmedCommand` and `MergeRejectedCommand` and their child classes, which implement the merging of profiles and policies respectively.
These classes extend `Command`. The child classes of `MergeCommand` are `MergePersonCommand` and `MergePolicyCommand`. A `MergePersonCommand` object will store the `Person` created by the input and the corresponding `Person` that is stored in the model.
Additionally, the main crucial operations implemented by this class are:

* `MergeCommand#getDifferences()` -- Finds all the different fields between the input person and the original person.
* `MergeCommand#removeFirstDifferentField()` -- Removes the first different field in the list of differences. This method is called after a merge decision has been input by the user and executed.
* `MergeCommand#getNextMergeFieldType()` -- Returns the type of the field for the next merge.
* `MergeCommand#onlyOneMergeLeft()` -- Checks whether there is only one merge left.

The implementation of `MergePolicyCommand` is similar.

The child classes of `MergeConfirmedCommand` are `MergePersonConfirmedCommand` and `MergePolicyConfirmedCommand`, while the child classes of `MergeRejectedCommand` are `MergePersonRejectedCommand` and `MergePolicyRejectedCommand`.
They all implement `#execute(Model)`. Additionally, these classes implement an `#isLastMerge()` command to indicate if this is the last possible merge for the entity being merged.

AddressBookParser stores a boolean flag to indicate whether a merge is currently taking place. When it is set as true, all other commands will not be parsed and will be treated as invalid commands.
The AddressBookParser object also stores the MergeCommand object during a merge process. This object is then used by `MergeConfirmedCommand` objects and `MergeRejectedCommand` objects in their execution.

image::MergeClassDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the merge mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user adds a duplicate profile. The `AddCommand` will throw a `DuplicatePersonWithMergeException` during its execution.
This exception is thrown if there is at least one different field between the input person and the original person stored in the model. Else, a `DuplicatePersonWithoutMergeException` will be thrown.
The `DuplicatePersonWithMergeException` will finally be caught in the `CommandBox`. UI outputs the error message and a prompt to start a merge. `CommandBox` then constructs two command strings: one to proceed with the merge and one to reject the merge.
This is done via `#standByForMerge(String, String)`. This string is then stored.

Step 2. The user inputs yes or presses enter to proceed with the merge. `CommandBox` then calls `CommandExecutor#execute()` to execute the merge command it constructed previously.
When the command is being parsed in the `AddressBookParser` object, a new `MergeCommand` object is created and stored. The `isMerging` flag is also set to true.
The execution of this command then returns a CommandResult that prompts the next merge.

Step 3. The user inputs yes or presses enter to update the field that was displayed in the prompt. The `AddressBookParser` parses the input and creates a new `MergePersonConfirmedCommand` object.
The `MergePersonConfirmedCommand` object obtains information for the merge from the `MergeCommand` object that was passed in as a parameter in the constructor.
In the execution, a new `EditCommand` is created and `EditCommand#executeForMerge()` is used to update the person in the model. If the
`MergePersonConfirmedCommand#isLastMerge` returns false, `MergeCommand#removeFirstDifferentField` is called and the command result then shows a success message and the next prompt.

This process is shown in the sequence diagram below.

image::MergeSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user inputs an invalid command, the prompt will be displayed again along with an error message.

Step 4. The user inputs no to reject the update of the field that was displayed in the prompt. The input gets parsed in the `AddressBookParser` object and creates a new MergePersonRejectedCommand.
If it is not the last merge, `MergeCommand#removeFirstDifferentField` is called. The command result then shows the next prompt. Else, it will show a success message of successfully updating the profile.

This is repeated until all merges have been prompted.

image::MergeActivityDiagram.png[width=200]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How merge command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `MergeCommand` object in the `AddressBookParser` to be accessed by `MergeConfirmedCommand` and `MergeRejectedCommand` objects.
** Pros: Finding of different fields is only executed once and can be used by future commands.
** Cons: More coupling between `MergeCommand` and other classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Update the field in the command string and pass it on in the command result.
** Pros: Less coupling between `MergeCommand` and other classes.
** Cons:
*** User has to see the updated command (information that user does not need to see is displayed).
*** Command still has to be stored somewhere to be accessed by other future merge commands.
// end::merging[]

// tag::display[]
=== Display Feature
==== Implementation

The `display` mechanism follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The model is facilitated by the `AddressBook`
instance, which provides the data the controller needs.
The controller is facilitated by an abstract class `DisplayController`, which extends `UIPart<Region>`.
Every supported format controller extends this abstract class.

The following class diagram shows the OOP solution for `display`:

image::DisplayClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Every controller needs to support every indicator. In the event a controller cannot display a particular
indicator, it will throw a `parseException` error, which provides suggestions of which visual controllers are supported
by the particular indicator.

The view is facilitated by the associated FXML. These views share a common
CSS, and also have their individual CSS file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `display i/policy-popularity-breakdown f/barchart` command to display the policy
popularity breakdown indicator in bar chart format. The execution of a `display` command determines
what will be shown (`displayIndicator`) and how it will be shown (`displayFormat`).

Step 2. `displayFormat` specifies that the controller `BarChartController` will be instantiated.

Step 3. The `BarChartController` initialises all the attributes of its associated FXML in its construction.
Let us take a  closer look at the initialisation of the `series` attribute. The controller utilises the display
indicator `policy-popularity-breakdown` to retrieve the data in the model it needs. The controller
then casts the model’s data type to the data type supported by bar charts. The result is assigned to `series` attribute.

The following sequence diagram shows the interaction between UI, Controller and Model for steps 2 and 3:

image::DisplaySequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 4. The bar chart controller then sets all the attributes of its associated FXML.

Step 5. Finally, the `MainWindow` calls `DisplayController#getRoot()` and displays the view.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the display command:

image::DisplayActivityDiagram.png[width=150]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should controllers interact with model

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Within controllers (by passing `logic`, which accesses the model, as an argument
to the instantiation of a controller.)
** Pros: Every controller handles their own interaction with the model.
** Cons: Inconsistent with current implementation (alternative 2).
* **Alternative 2:** Within `MainWindow`
** Pros: Consistent with current implementation
** Cons: The controllers are fully dependent on `MainWindow` for the data from the model. This entails that


===== Aspect: OOP solution for visual controllers

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display controllers to extend from abstract class `DisplayController`
** Pros:
*** Allows display controller subclasses to share code. (refer to class diagram above)
*** Subclasses have many common methods (`initIndicators(Logic)`)
* **Alternative 2:** Display controllers to implement interface `DisplayController`
** Pros: Satisfies the can-do relationship of an interface.
** Cons: Restricted to public access modifiers. This violates Law of Demeter.
// end::display[]

// tag::bin[]
=== Bin Feature
==== Implementation

The bin feature is facilitated by `BinItem`, `UniqueBinItemList` classes and the interface `Binnable`. Objects that
can be "binned" will implement the interface  `Binnable`. When a `Binnable` object is deleted, it is wrapped in a
wrapper class `BinItem` and is moved into `UniqueBinItemList`.

The follow class diagram shows how bin is implemented.

image::BinClassDiagram.png[]

`BinItem` has 2 key attributes that is wrapped on top of the `Binnable` object, namely: `dateDeleted` and `expiryDate`.
Objects in the bin stays there for 30 days, before it is automatically deleted forever. Both attributes are used in the
auto-deletion mechanism of objects in the bin.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the bin mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. When the user launches *Insurelytics*, `ModelManager` will run `ModelManager#binCleanUp()`, which will check the
`expiryDate` of all objects in `UniqueBinItemList` against the system clock. If the system clock exceeds `expiryDate`,
`UniqueBinItemList#remove()` is called and deletes the expired object forever.

Step 2. The user executes `deletepolicy 1` command to delete the first policy in the address book. The `deletepolicy`
command calls the constructor of `BinItem` with the deleted policy to create a new `BinItem` object. At this
juncture, the attribute `dateDeleted` is created, and `expiryDate` is generated by adding `TIME_TO_LIVE` to
`dateDeleted`. At the same time, references to the policy that was just deleted will also be removed from any `BinItem`
that has them.

[NOTE]
Removing references of deleted policies in items inside the bin only happens for `deletepolicy`. Removing of
references does not happen for deleted persons, since policies don't keep track of the persons that bought them.

Step 3. The `deletepolicy` command then calls `Model#addBinItem(policyToBin)` and shifts the newly created `BinItem` to
`UniqueBinItemList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `deletepolicy` operation involves the bin.

image::BinDeletePolicySequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 4. The user quits the current session and starts a new session some time later. He/she then realises that he/she
needs the person that was deleted and wants it back, so he/she executes `restore 1` to restore the deleted person
from the bin.

Step 5. The `restore` command then calls `Model#deleteBinItem(itemToRestore)`, which removes `itemToRestore` from
`UniqueBinItemList`. The wrapper class `BinItem` is then stripped and the internal policy item is added back to
`UniquePolicyList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how a restore command operates.

image::RestoreSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes the steps above.

image::BinActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Which part of the architecture does Bin belong
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As part of AddressBook
** Pros: Lesser repeated code and unnecessary refactoring. Other features at the AddressBook level such as undo/redo
will not be affected with a change/modification made to Bin as it is not dependent on them.
** Cons: From a OOP design point of view, this is not the most direct way of structuring the program.

* **Alternative 2:** Just like AddressBook, as part of Model
** Pros: More OOP like and lesser dependencies since Bin is extracted out from AddressBook. Methods related to bin
operations are called only from within Bin.
** Cons: Many sections with repeated code since it is structurally similar to AddressBook.
// end::bin[]

//tag::history[]
=== Command History Feature
==== Implementation

To allow users to view the list of previously entered commands, a command history mechanism is implemented, which
lists down all the previous (valid) commands entered by the user from the point of starting the application. Commands entered
while merging are not added. The feature is supported by the `CommandHistory` class, an instance of which is stored as one of the
memory objects inside `ModelManager`. The main operations implemented by this class are:

* `addCommand(commandWord, commandText)` -- Adds the command with the command word `commandWord` and full command text
`commandText` into the list of previously entered commands `userInputHistory`.
* `getHistory()` -- Reverses the list of previously entered commands and returns the list.

The history view is accompanied by its associated `HistoryCard` and `HistoryListPanel` FXML. These views share a common CSS
with other FXML files.

Following is the sequence diagram that shows the interaction between different components of the app when the command
`history` is typed in by the user:

image::CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where to store the CommandHistory object

* **Alternative 1:** Place the `CommandHistory` object directly in the `LogicManager` class
** Pros: Since the user input is being parsed in `LogicManager`, storing the command history ensures that data is
not being passed around between the `LogicManager` and the `ModelManager`.
** Cons: By right the `LogicManager` is only concerned with handling logic, any data storage should be performed in
`ModelManager`. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Place the `CommandHistory` object in model manager, parse user input in
`LogicManager` and pass it to `ModelManager`.
** Pros: Separation of concerns and Single Responsibility Principle for `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` is maintained.
** Cons: Increases coupling between `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`, thereby violating the Law of Demeter.

===== Aspect: Which commands to display in command history

* **Alternative 1:** Display only those commands which will be relevant to user if she is considering undo/redo
(therefore, display only data changes)
** Pros: Only commands which are more relevant shown to user.
** Cons: Which commands are relevant depends on the user, moreover limits the application of command history
feature to undo/redo application.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Display every valid command entered by the user
** Pros: More accurate representation of command history.
** Cons: Clutters the command history with potentially unnecessary commands.
// end::history[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Implementation

To allow users to revert/return to a previous/future state of the address book, an undo/redo mechanism is implemented, which
undoes/redoes the last data change made in the application. The feature is supported by the `StatefulAddressBook` class,
an instance of which is stored as one of the memory objects inside `ModelManager`.

image::UndoRedoClassDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo-redo mechanism works at each step. Let us assume that `StatefulAddressBook` has just been initialised.

Step 1. The user makes some data changes. This adds a list of states to our `StatefulAddressBook`, and updates the
`currentStatePointer`.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 2. User types `undo`. The `currentStatePointer` is decremented, and the address book is reset to the one being pointed to by
`currentStatePointer`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

Step 3a. The use can perform another data change, following which states after `currentStatePointer` are erased,
and a new state is added.

image::UndoRedoState3a.png[]

Step 3b. If a command which does not perform a data change is called, `StatefulAddressBook` stays the same
as seen in `Step 2`. If a `redo()` is called, then the `currentStatePointer` is incremented.

image::UndoRedoState3c.png[]

Step 4. If the address book data is reset to another state's, then all the data inside the application is reloaded, with
the resulting changes now reflected.

Following is the activity diagram. The diagram for a `redo` command will be similar.

image::UndoActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement, takes way lesser code.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for delete, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

* **Alternative 3:** Do not store entire address book, but a PersonList, PolicyList and BinList depending on what
is changed.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for delete, just save the person list).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. Several cases to consider
when we try to undo a command.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::eligibility[]
=== Eligibility Feature
==== Implementation

Eligibility was implemented as part of the overall search feature. It comprises the following two separate but related
functionalities: searching for eligible policies given a person and searching for eligible people given a policy. These
features can be accessed by the user from the `eligiblepolicies` and `eligiblepeople` commands respectively. The feature
is supported by the `Person`, `Policy` and `Tag`, `StartAge` and `EndAge` classes from the model component. The
eligibility functionality is supported by the following main operations:

* `Policy#isEligible(Person person)` -- Checks if a person is eligible for the policy the method is called from
* `Policy#isEligibleAge(int age)` -- Checks if an age is eligible for the policy the method is called from
* `Person#getTags()` -- Returns a `Set<Tag>` of all the tags a person possesses
* `Tag#equals(Object other)` -- Checks if a tag is equal to another object

The following is a class diagram illustrating the relationship between the classes involved in determining eligibility:

image::EligibilityClassDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario of `eligiblepeople` and how the eligibility mechanism works at each step. The
eligibility mechanism for `eligiblepolicies` is similar.

Step 1. The user enters the `eligiblepeople` command with a valid policy index (e.g. `eligiblepeople 1`) to display the
list of people eligible for the policy, resulting in the `EligiblePeopleCommand#execute()` command being called.

Step 2. A `PersonEligibleForPolicy` predicate is created from the specified policy and passed into the
`model#updateFilteredPersonList` command.

Step 3. The `FilteredList` object entitled 'filteredList' is then updated through testing of each person with
`PersonEligibleForPolicyPredicate#test(Person person)`.

- For each iteration, the `Policy#isEligible(Person person)` method is called, which checks if the person
possesses all the policy's criteria in its tags (from `Person#getTags()`) and that his or her age (calculated from his
date of birth), lies between the policy's start and end age.
- If both of these conditions are met, the item passes the predicate and remains on the filtered list; otherwise it is
removed.

Step 4. The `EligiblePeopleCommand#execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` with the `listPeople` attribute set as true.

Following is the sequence diagram that illustrates the above process:

image::EligibilitySequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Format to store criteria

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store each criteria as a `Tag` object
** Pros: Since criteria are stored as tags, checking to see if a person's tag and a policy's criterion match is extremely
simple, utilizing the `Tag#equals(Other object)` method. Repetition of code can therefore be avoided.
** Cons: Future developers unaware of this design choice may be confused by the method of checking eligibility.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a separate `Criteria` class for criteria
** Pros: Separation of concerns and Single Responsibility Principle for `Tag` and `Criteria` is maintained.
** Cons: An equivalence function will need to be written to compare `Tag` and `Criteria` objects, which is unnecessary
code to be written and maintained. Increases coupling between `Tag` and `Criteria`, changing the format of one will
inevitably need to be reflected in the other. Failing to do so would introduce bugs.
// end::eligibility[]

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
