    "description": "This module is intended for students keen on pursuing post-graduate tourism research. It is multidisciplinary in approach with the broad aim of addressing the complex processes at play when tourism is harnessed for economic growth. Using examples from the Asia-Pacific region, the module explores tourism initiatives at the governmental level comparing them with the efforts by NGOs and other informal collectives. The module will also examine the real and perceived impacts of tourism on regional economies, environments, societies, cultures and political systems with an eye to critically evaluating the role of tourism in the contemporary world. The module will be structured around discussion points, and students are expected to contribute in the form of seminar presentations and essay assignments.",
