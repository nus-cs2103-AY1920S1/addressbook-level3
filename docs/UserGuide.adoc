== Introduction

Welcome to SecureIT!

image::SecureITLogo.png[]

Skeptical about apps that store your confidential information online? But tired of having to keep track of all of them manually? Well look no further! Now you can enjoy the best of both worlds.

SecureIT is specifically designed to help manage your confidential information all in one application. More importantly,
it *stores your information locally,*  and does not use any form of online storage!


SecureIT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For those of you who are type fast, SecureIT can manage your confidential information faster than traditional GUI apps.


Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

// end::intro[]

== Basic Information
This following guide will teach you how you can use `SecureIT` to keep track of your confidential information so you will never have to worry about your information ever again.

Confused? You refer to <<Quick Start>> for a simple set-up.

If you are overwhelmed by all the instructions and don't know which one to use, our <<CheatSheet of commands>> is here to help you.

The following list of icons below will assist you to understand our material:

=== Card

Too many credit cards to carry around? With SecureIT, you can easily manage your card information.

To access your cards, simply enter `goto card` in the command box.

==== Creating a card : `add`

You can easily adds cards to the application.

Format: `add d/DESCRIPTION c/CARDNUMBER v/CVC e/EXPIRY [t/TAG]`

Example: `add d/VisaPOSB c/5203123458392748 v/456 e/12/25 t/groceries`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Format:*

* Description entered is *case sensitive*.
* Card numbers can be entered with or without dashes.
** With dashes: 1234-5678-1234-5678
** Without dashes: 1234567812345678
* Card expiry is of the format MM/YY.
* You can include up to 5 tags.
====
====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Note:*

* SecureIT does not support cards types that are not MasterCard or Visa.
* All card numbers entered must have 16 digits.
====
====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* After adding your cards, a card's description and its index in the list are interchangeable with each other. In other words, the following commands accept either *description* or *index*, but not both.
* If you know exactly which card you need, you can easily type the description without needing to scroll through the list.
* When your card is about the expire, SecureIT warns you with a notification upon start up. On top of that, you can easily see which cards are expiring or expired in the cards list.
====

==== Reading a card : `read`

If you already have a card in mind and want to view its details, you can easily do so by entering the card description and its CVC.

Format: `read d/DESCRIPTION v/CVC`

Example: `read d/VisaPOSB v/456`

You can also obtain the same result by using a card's index in the list with the correct CVC.

Format: `read INDEX v/CVC`

Example: `read 1 v/456`

==== Copying a card : `copy`

You can copy a specific card's card number to your clipboard as well.

You can choose to copy the card number using its description:

Format: `copy d/DESCRIPTION v/CVC`

Example: `copy d/VisaPOSB v/456`

Alternatively, you can also perform the command with the card's index in the list.

Format: `copy INDEX v/CVC`

Example: `copy 1 v/456`
====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Note:*

* This command *only* copies the specified card number, and not the CVC. This is because users are expected to remember their CVC so that their card security is not compromised.
====

==== Deleting a card: `delete`
====
--
image::warning.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Warning*

* Deleted cards are not recoverable
====

If your card has expired, you can easily remove it from the application.

Again, you could do this by the card's description:

Format: `delete DESCRIPTION`

Example: `delete VisaPOSB`

Or by its index:

Format: `delete INDEX`

Example: `delete 1`

=== File

SecureIT has a file manager which helps you keep confidential files that you do not wish others to see. Using your master password, SecureIT converts your files into an encrypted format which cannot be read by other applications.

To access the file manager, simply enter `goto file` in the command box.

==== Encrypting a file : `encrypt`

You can encrypt a local file using its file path. You may also tag the file at the same time for easy reference later on.

Encrypted files have the prefix `[LOCKED]` in their file names.

Format: `encrypt FILEPATH [t/TAG]...`

Example: +
For Windows: `encrypt C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\Test.txt t/personal` +
For macOS: `encrypt /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop/Test.txt t/personal` +
(The actual file path may differ on your OS. Hence, it is always recommended to drag the file in the input field.)

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* Instead of typing the file path, you can drag the file into the input field to easily append the file path. This also applies to other commands (e.g. `add`, `move`).
* The app may freeze for some time if the file to be encrypted is large. Please do not force exit the app during encryption.
* The app does not support encryption of files larger than 2GB.
====

====
--
image::warning.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Warning*

* The `encrypt` command only alters the file content but does not set up additional access rights. In other words, it keeps your information secret but does not keep your files safe from malicious alteration or deletion.
* If you wish to prevent alternation or deletion of files, please set up additional access rights using your operating system. SecureIT is not responsible for any data loss resulting from lack of access right settings.
* If you are using Windows, please close the file before encryption.
====

==== Decrypting a file : `decrypt`

You can decrypt a local file using its displayed index number.

Format: `decrypt INDEX`

Example: `decrypt 1` (This command decrypts the first file in the displayed file list.)

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* If you notice that the file decryption fails, it may be because you have renamed the file or moved the file to another location without using SecureIT (for example, using your operating system directly).
* In that case, use `remove` command to remove the file from the list first, and then use `add` command to add the renamed/moved file. Please refer to the `remove` and `add` command sections for detailed instructions.
====

==== Adding an encrypted file : `add`

You can add an encrypted file using its file path. You may tag the file at the same time for easy reference later on. The file must be encrypted by SecureIT previously.

Format: `add FILENAME [t/TAG]...`

Example: +
For Windows: `add C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\[LOCKED] Test.txt t/personal` +
For macOS: `add /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop/[LOCKED] Test.txt t/personal` +
(The actual file path may differ on your OS. Hence, it is always recommended to drag the file in the input field.)

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The file name does not have to contain the prefix `[LOCKED]`. SecureIT can recognise the file and automatically prepend the prefix.
====

==== Removing a file : `remove`

You can remove an encrypted file record using its displayed index number.

Please note that only the file record within SecureIT is removed. The actual file is not deleted from the file system.

Format: `remove INDEX`

Example: `remove 1`

====
--
image::warning.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Warning*

* The "encrypted at" and "last edited at" timestamps are stored within SecureIT and will be discarded if you remove the record from SecureIT. They are not recoverable even if you add the file back using `add` command.
====

==== Renaming an encrypted file : `rename`

You can rename an encrypted file using its index number. The prefix `[LOCKED]` is retained.

Format: `rename INDEX TARGET_FILENAME`

Example: `rename 1 Test2`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The file extension of the file is retained using `rename` command. If you give a file extension in the target file name, it will be ignored.
====

==== Moving an encrypted file : `move`

You can move an encrypted file using its index number. The target directory must be a real directory (not a shortcut, alias, symbolic link, etc.)

Format: `move INDEX TARGET_DIRECTORY`

Example: +
For Windows: `move 1 C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop` +
For macOS: `move 1 /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop` +
(The actual file path may differ on your OS. Hence, it is always recommended to drag the directory in the input field.)

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* It is recommended to rename and move files using SecureIT to better manage your files.
* If you have renamed or moved your files without using SecureIT (for example, using the operating system directly), you have to use `remove` command to remove the file from the list first, and then use `add` command to add the renamed/moved file.
====

==== Finding encrypted files : `find`

You can find matching encrypted files using the search keywords.

To return from search results, use `list` command.

Format: `find KEYWORDS...`

Example: `find Test`
====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `test` will match `Test`.
* Both the file name and the file path are searched. Hence, you can look for files with certain types (e.g. `find .png .jpg`) or files inside certain directories (e.g. `find /Desktop`).
====

==== Listing all files : `list`

You can list all encrypted files managed by SecureIT.

Format: `list`

==== Viewing an encrypted file : `preview`

You can preview an encrypted file using its index number. You can only preview `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files.

Format: `preview INDEX`

Example: `preview 1`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The app may freeze for some time if the file to be previewed is large. Please do not force exit the app.
* The file preview is for your reference only. Due to various standards on file formats, the preview can be different from the actual file. For example, your annotations on PDF files may not be correctly displayed, and the text format of Word files may not be retained in the preview.

--
*Tip*

* You can sort by one or more conditions separated by a whitespace.
* The first condition takes the greatest precedence in sorting.
EG: NumOfAccess condition in above example has greater precedence
over DateModified condition.
====
====
--
