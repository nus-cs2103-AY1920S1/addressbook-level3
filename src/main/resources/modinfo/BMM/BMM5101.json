    "description": "The objective of this course is to help policy makers understand and improve the quality of policy decisions and become a better decision maker. The course will take a systematic view of decision making from both normative and descriptive perspectives. The normative approach may help decision makers to identify, structure, and analyze decision problems in a systematic and logical manner. On the other hand, the descriptive approach has provided insightful understandings of how people deviate from rational decision-making and easily fall into common decision traps. This course will teach students how to think critically about the decisions people make, how to avoid common decision pitfalls, and how to improve decision making skills by offering a comprehensive cross-disciplinary knowledge of decision making and more importantly its real life applications.",
