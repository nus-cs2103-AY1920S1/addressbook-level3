    "description": "This course explores the legal issues \u2010 both from a conflict of laws perspective and a substantive law one \u2010 that may arise in connection with business contracts (such as contracts for the sale of goods, factoring contracts, leasing contracts, transport contracts, etc.) that involve some element of internationality and examines those issues in light of some of the sets of rules specifically designed to address those issues when embedded in an international setting (such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the International Factoring Convention, the Convention on International Financial Leasing, the Montreal Convention, the Rome I Regulation, etc.). The course will also offer an overview of the basic features of litigation of those issues in state courts and before arbitral tribunals.",
