    "description": "For the past two centuries, the world has been organized around nation-states. Defined by language, culture, history, government, military power, and clear boundaries, a nation organizes how citizens run their lives and their businesses. More recently, the dominance of nations has been challenged \u2013 sometimes subtly, sometimes aggressively \u2013 by multinational companies, which can seem to exist above governments\u2019 sway. The world of today \u2013 and of tomorrow \u2013 is caught in the intersection of these two forces. This course will look at this conflict from a variety of perspectives, utilizing insights from history, business, and other disciplines to explore phenomena and case studies.",
