== About the Project
Me and my team of four other software engineering coursemates were tasked with morphing a given codebase for a
Command-Line Interface (CLI) desktop app originally designed to store contact information. We decided to morph the app
into an all-in-one study aid application, targeted specifically at NUS Computer Science students. Our app supports
the use of flashcards and notes, provides a timetrial feature for flashcards, and includes automatic
cheatsheet-generation tool.

My role in this project was to write the code for Notes, implement their basic functions, and implement the ability
to add tags within the content of notes. Additionally, I was tasked with completing both the user guide and developer
guide portions for the entire Notes feature, and any other relevant documentation. This Project Portfolio thus
details my contributions to this project.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major contribution*: Added *Notes*, and implemented the ability to *add tags within Notes* (i.e. intra-content
tagging).
** What Notes are: Notes are pieces of information with titles, content, and optional tags. The operations that they
support are:
*** Creation
*** Deletion
*** Viewing (in both raw form and simplified form)
*** Filtering
** What the Add Tags Within Notes feature is:
*** Using a pre-defined syntax, allows the user to tag specific portions of a note with tags.
*** These tags are independent of the note's original tags.
*** They can be filtered just like normal notes can be, but cannot be directly viewed or listed.
*** They can be used to isolate specific pieces of information for cheatsheet-making.
** Uses of Notes:
*** Allows the user to store information in an accessible format
** Uses of the Add Tags Within Notes feature:
*** Allows fine-tuned addition of information to cheatsheets
*** Allows for specific highlighting of information in notes
* *Minor contribution*: Implemented the `view` and `viewraw` commands for Notes.
** What it is: Both commands view a given note fragment tag, but the `view` command also cleans up the syntax of the
note to remove the leftover syntax from the addition of the note fragment tag.

* *Other contributions*:
** Project issue management:
*** e.g. group issue reminders for DG, UG, testing, along with todos for each
*** Managed release v1.3 (out of v1.0 to v1.4)
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote test code for all Note-related code
* <I guess I need to pore through all my PRs and look for other documentation and code refactoring stuff; also need
to look at reposense and compare what's there>

== Contributions to User Guide

=== Creating a note: `add`

* Adds a note from user input with title `TITLE` and content `CONTENT`. The title of the note cannot be a duplicate
of an existing note title.

    Format: add t/TITLE c/CONTENT [tag/TAG]...

    Example usage: add t/Pipelining Definition c/Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes
    simultaneously. tag/CS2100

    Expected output:
    New note added:
        Title: Pipelining Definition
        Content: Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes simultaneously.
        Tags: [cs2100]

* More advanced usage: Tagging of note fragments is also supported. The note fragment tagging is added at the
same time as the note is created.

* Note fragment tags are added with content `FRAGMENT_CONTENT`, at least one tag
`FRAGMENT_TAG`, and any number of additional tags `ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENT_TAG`:

    Format (within CONTENT): /* C/FRAGMENT_CONTENT TAG/FRAGMENT_TAG [TAG/ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENT_TAG]... */

IMPORTANT: The format for Note fragment content is 'C/', not 'c/', and the format for Note fragment tags is 'TAG/', not
'tag/'.

* In the following example, two note fragment tags are added to the same note fragment:

    Example usage: add t/About c/Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed. tag/about

Expected output:

    New note added:
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
        Tags: [about]

* This adds a note with content "Notes can be highlighted if needed.", and a note fragment tag with content
"highlighted" and two tags "cs2100" and "important".

* Multiple note fragment tags are allowed. These do not interfere with the other tags of the Note.

IMPORTANT: Overlapping note fragment tags are not allowed.

NOTE: Note fragment tags can be used for filtering notes (see Section 6.6), or filtering globally (see Section 4.3).
For a clearer visualization of note fragments, compare the `view` (see Section 6.3) and `viewraw` (see Section 6.4)
commands.

=== Deleting a note: `delete`

Deletes the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`.

The user will be prompted once to confirm their deletion.

    Format: delete (index)

    Example usage: delete 3

    Expected output:
        Are you sure you would like to delete the following note?
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed.
        Tags: [about]
        Hit enter again to confirm your deletion.

Upon hitting enter, the note will be deleted.

    Deleted note:
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
        Tags: [about]

=== Viewing a note: `view`

Views the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`. If the note contains any note fragment tags, those tags will be hidden.

NOTE: To view the note with its note fragment tags, use the `viewraw` command instead (see Section 6.4).

    Format: view (index)

    Example usage: view 3

    Expected output:
    Viewing note:
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be highlighted if needed.
        Tags: [about]

=== Viewing a raw note: `viewraw`

Views the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`. The note is shown exactly as written, including all note fragment tags.

    Format: viewraw (index)

    Example usage: viewraw 3

    Expected output:
    Viewing raw note:
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
        Tags: [about]

=== Listing notes: `list`

* Lists all notes found in StudyBuddyPro.

   Format: list

   Expected output: a complete list of all notes currently in StudyBuddyPro

    Example output:
    Listing all notes:
    1.
        Title: Pipelining Definition
        Content: Pipelining is a process where a /* C/processor TAG/mips */ executes multiple processes simultaneously.
        Tags: [cs2100]
    2.
        Title: UML Diagrams
        Content: UML Diagrams help with visualizing project structure.
        Tags: [cs2103t]

NOTE: Notes will be labeled with indices '1', '2' etc. Note fragment tags will not be listed along with the notes. To
visualize specific note fragment tags, use the `filter` command (see Section 6.6).

=== Listing by tags: `filter`

* Filters the note library by the user specified tag(s).
* The user must specify at least one tag, and can specify multiple tags.
* Notes that match all of the specified tags will be displayed.
* Note fragment tags containing all of the specified tags will also be displayed, even if their parent note is
not tagged.

    Format: filter tag/TAG [tag/TAG]...

    Example usage: filter tag/difficult

    Expeted output: Filter notes by tag(s) :
        [difficult]
        2. Title: Tough Math
            Content: 1 + 2 is 3.
            Tags: [difficult]
        4. Title: MA1521 Chapter 5
            Content: dy/dx = 0 is turning point of bellcurve.
            Tags: [difficult][MA1521]
        5-1. Title: CS2103T
              Content: sequence diagram
              Tags: [difficult][diagram]

NOTE: Notes will be labeled with indices '1', '2' etc. Note fragment tags will be labeled with '1-1', '1-2', '2-1' etc.
'5-1' means 'the first note fragment tag in the fifth note'.

=== Editing a note: `edit` (Coming in v2.0)

Edits a note's title, content, or tags. The note will be referred to by their original title `ORIGINAL_TITLE`.

* The user can specify one of the optional fields to edit.

    Format: edit ORIGINAL_TITLE [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [tag/TAG]...

    Example usage: edit Pipelining Definition t/Pipelined Definition tag/cs2100finals

    Expected output:
    Edited Note:
        Title: Pipelined Definition
        Content: Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes simultaneously.
        Tags: [cs2100finals]



== Contributions to Developer Guide

=== Add Tags Within Notes feature

`Notes` are used in the creation of `CheatSheet` objects as well as in general use of StudyBuddyPro. This Add Tags
Within Notes feature allows for the addition of tags within the content of the `Note`, to allow more precise
highlighting and tagging of information.

[IMPORTANT]
All the operations assume that the user is in the _notes_ mode.

==== Design Implementation of Notes

`Notes` contain a `Title` and a `Content`, with optional `Tags` and `NoteFragments`, as shown in the diagram below:

image::samDiagrams/NoteModelClassDiagram.png[]

`Notes` are `StudyBuddyItems`, and can contain any number of `NoteFragments`. `NoteFragment` objects are used to
represent the specific areas within a `Note` that have been tagged. Each tag within a `Note` is referred to as a *note
fragment tag* (which is represented by a `NoteFragment` object).

NOTE: Note fragment tags should not be confused with `Tags`.

`NoteFragments` contain:

** A `Title` that is the same as their parent `Note`
** A `Content` that is a substring of their parent `Note`
** Any indicated `Tags` that are independent of their parent `Note`

`NoteFragments` are viewed or used in the following situations:

** Viewable through the `filter` and `filterall` commands
** Usable through `add` commands in _cheatsheet_ mode (see Section 4.4)

==== Usages of Notes

`Notes` can be used to:

** Store information under a title
** Categorize information via the use of `Tags`
** Provide information to `CheatSheets` for collation

`Notes` can currently be:

** Added to `StudyBuddyBook`
** Deleted from `StudyBuddyBook`
** Viewed raw or cleaned from `StudyBuddyBook`
** Viewed using `filter` from `StudyBuddyBook`

==== Design Implementation of the Add Tags Within Notes feature

The Add Tags Within Notes feature was implemented in the following way:

** Creation of a `NoteFragment` class that represents one tag within a `Note`
** Have each `Note` contain any number of `NoteFragments` in a list
** Upon addition of a `Note`, parse its `Content` to check for any note fragment tags within it
** Create any required `NoteFragment` objects and add them to the list in their parent `Note`
** Since `NoteFragments` are contained within `Notes`, when a `Note` is deleted, its `NoteFragments` will be deleted as well.

There are four main methods that involve `NoteFragments`. They are listed below:

** `NoteFeatureUtil#parseNoteFragmentsFromNote()`: Used by `Note` to create `NoteFragments`.
** `ModelManager#collectTaggedItems()`: Used in the `filterall` command.
** `ModelManager#collectTaggedNotes()`: Used in the _notes_ `filter` command.
** `AddCheatSheetCommand#getRelevantContents()`: Used to generate `CheatSheets`.

Out of these four methods, only `NoteFeatureUtil#parseNoteFragmentsFromNote()` is aware of the `NoteFragment` class.
The other three methods are only aware of the `Note` class.

The implementation of these four methods is shown below:

===== Implementation of `NoteFeatureUtil#parseNoteFragmentsFromNote()`:

The method of parsing `Content` in `NoteFeatureUtil#parseNoteFragmentsFromNote()` relies on the use of `Prefixes`
around each note fragment tag. Each note fragment tag is specified with a start ("/\*") and end ("*/") marker, and
its `Content` and `Tags` are also represented with the `Prefixes` 'C/' and 'TAG/'.

Example usage:

    add t/About c/Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed. tag/about

[NOTE]
'C/' and 'TAG/' have to be used instead of the default 'c/' and 'tag/' because otherwise the note fragment tag would
raise an error (since only one 'c/' tag is allowed per command).

Expected output:

    New note added:
        Title: About
        Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
        Tags: [about]

A `Note` has been added with the `Content` of "Notes can be highlighted if needed.", and a note fragment tag with
`Content` "highlighted" and two `Tags` "cs2100" and "important". Despite this, the `Note` itself is instead tagged
with the `Tag` "about".

When an `add` command is made:

** Only the `Prefixes` 't/', 'c/', and 'tag/' are identified and parsed.
** A `Note` is then created with the desired `Title`, `Content`, and `Tags`.
** After creation, the `Content` of the `Note` is parsed immediately for the `Prefixes` '/\*', '*/', 'C/', and 'TAG/'
.
** All four `Prefixes` must be present for the note fragment tag to be considered valid. Otherwise, an exception is
thrown.

The sequence diagram below describes the process of adding a new note that contains a note fragment tag:

<INSERT SEQUENCE DIAGRAM HERE, and refer to it below>

===== Implementation of `NoteFragments` in `list` command:

When `Notes` are listed, `NoteFragments` do not appear in the list of resulting `Notes`. This is because the
`ListCommand#execute()` method uses `ModelManager#updatedFilteredNoteList()`, which does not check for any
`NoteFragments` within `Notes`. This is illustrated in the <WHAT KIND OF> diagram below:

<SOME DIAGRAM SHOWING CALLING OF LISTCOMMAND FOR NOTE - but is this necessary? Would need to refer to it after the text>

This decision is made because the `list` command already lists all `Notes`, and therefore it would be unnecessary to
also list all `NoteFragments`, as `NoteFragments` form a subset of `Notes`.

===== Implementation of `NoteFragments` in `filter` command:

When `Notes` are filtered, the method `ModelManager#collectTaggedNotes()` is used, which checks for any valid tags in
`NoteFragments` within the `Note` as it checks each `Note`.

However, `ModelManager` uses the method `Note#getFilteredNoteFragments()` to achieve this, and therefore is not
aware of the existence of `NoteFragments`. This is illustrated in the <WHAT KIND OF> diagram below:

<SOME DIAGRAM SHOWING CALLING OF FILTERCOMMAND FOR NOTE - but is this necessary? Would need to refer to it after the
text>

This diagram can be contrasted with the <WHICH NUMBER?> diagram above, which uses a different method <DESCRIBE> that
does not account for `NoteFragments`.

The separation between `Notes` and `NoteFragments` in the `filter` command allows for more finely-tuned viewing of
specific tagged details. For instance:

** A small portion of a long `Note` can be tagged out as 'important'.
** Different parts of the same `Note` can be given different `Tags` like 'CS2103T' or 'CS2100', even as the entire
`Note` is tagged under a larger category like 'CS'.

===== Implementation of `NoteFragments` in `filterall` command:

When all `StudyBuddyItems` are filtered, the method `ModeManager#collectTaggedItems()` is used, which performs a
similar task to `ModelManager#collectTaggedNotes()`, but also collects `Flashcard` and `CheatSheet` objects as well.
The reasoning for this decision is similar to that in the `filter` command.

===== Implementation of `NoteFragments` in `add` command in `CheatSheets`:

When a `CheatSheet` is created, the method `AddCheatSheetCommand#getRelevantContent()` is used to filter out all
`Notes` and `NoteFragments` that contain the specified `Tags`. Again, `AddCheatSheetCommand` uses the method
`Note#getFilteredNoteFragments()` to obtain the filtered list of `NoteFragments`, and is therefore unaware of the
existence of `NoteFragment`.

Since the `Tags` stored in `Notes` and `NoteFragments` are independent of each other, they are filtered in the same
way as in the `filter` command. As a result, it is possible for a `NoteFragment` to be included in a `CheatSheet`
even when its parent `Note` is not.

==== Design Considerations of the Add Tags Within Notes feature

===== Aspect: Container location for `NoteFragment`

** Alternative 1 (current choice): Each `Note` contains a `List<NoteFragment>`:
*** Pros: Much easier maintenance, since `NoteFragments` are automatically deleted with the deletion of their parent
`Note`.
*** Cons: O(n^2^) search time for `filter` commands, as all `NoteFragments` in each `Note` in the `UniqueNoteList`
must be searched through to filter them out.

** Alternative 2: Separate `UniqueNoteFragmentList` from `UniqueNoteList`:
*** Pros: O(n) search time for `filter` commands, as the `UniqueNoteFragmentList` exists separately from the
`UniqueNoteList`.
*** Cons: Difficult to maintain; deletion of a parent Note requires searching the `UniqueNoteFragmentList` for any
child `NoteFragments` to delete as well.

==== Usages of the Add Tags Within Notes feature

** Use in `filter` and `filterall` to make the GUI less cluttered
** Use in `filter` to highlight specific sections of `Notes`
** Use in `add` for `CheatSheets` for more parsimonious usage of space

==== (Proposed) Future Improvements for v2.0

===== `edit` command for `Notes`

This feature will allow for users to edit their `Notes`, by specifying a new `Title`, `Content`, or `Tags`.

===== (Proposed) Implementation

** Expected inputs:
*** The original `Title` of the `Note` to be edited
*** One or more fields that the user wants to edit
** Create an `EditCommandParser` to parse the input command using `ArgumentTokenizer`
** Create an `EditCommand` which contains `EditCommand#execute()`
*** This method creates a new `Note` which contains all old fields, then replaces any old field with a new field, if
it is made available

Example usage:

    edit Old Title t/New Title

This would result in the `Note` which was originally called 'Old Title' having its `Title` changed to 'New Title'.
Since no two `Notes` are allowed to have the same `Title`, it is a unique identifier of the `Note` to be edited.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Method of editing

** Alternative 1: Create a new `Note` object
*** Pros: Is more defensive, since only a shallow copy of the `Note` object is returned.
*** Cons: Longer command run time, as a new `Note` object needs to be created first, and then edited.

** Alternative 2: Edit the exiting `Note` object
*** Pros: Command will run faster, since no new `Note` object needs to be created.
*** Cons: Is not defensively programmed, as `Notes` should be immutable.
