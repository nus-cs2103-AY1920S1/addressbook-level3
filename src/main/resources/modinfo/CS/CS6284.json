    "description": "Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the area of big-data systems on emerging hardware. The opportunities and challenges from emerging big-data processing systems have been raised different scales, from a single machine to thousands of machines. The need for effectively utilizing computing resources creates new technologies and research directions: from conventional ones (e.g., cluster computing, in-memory computing), to more recent ones (e.g., GPGPU, many-core processors, NVRAM). This module will introduce students to the architecture, performance optimization and design of big data systems on various emerging high performance computing hardware including many-core processors and accelerators.",
