    "description": "Before technology created augmented reality, the ancient practice of 'memory palaces' combined mental visualization with material environments. Over 2,000 years, this practice split along different paths: (1) an analytical tool and (2) a technique for memorizing large chunks of information. The memory palace is method people used for memorizing, organizing, and recalling large amounts of information before there were computers. In this course, students will learn and draw from rhetorical theories of memory to analyse communication. Simultaneously, they will use the memory palace to train for a mini-memory championship, held in the last two weeks of the module.",
