    "description": "With a system of sounds and marks, we human beings are able to share knowledge, coordinate actions, prompt emotional responses, and make things like marriages and names come into existence. This course will consider what Sanskrit and Anglophone philosophers have to say about speech acts. We will start with M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, known as the 'science of sentences', and think about how commands and exhortations work. We then turn to J.L. Austin\u2019s seminal How to Do Things with Words, which introduced speech act theory to Anglophone philosophy. The course will close with some contemporary attempts to integrate M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and speech act theory.",
