== Introduction

This program is targeted at clerks working in small clinics. It is designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). It allows clerks to manage appointments, staff's duty roster, inventories and queues. Typing fast allows you to complete your tasks much faster than GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `clerkPro.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ClerkPro.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
. You may navigate through the entire UI with kbd:[UP], kbd:[DOWN], kbd:[LEFT], kbd:[RIGHT] and kbd:[TAB].
. The figure below shows the layout.
+

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. Alternatively, just press kbd:[F1].
.  Some example commands you can try:


* `register -id 001A -name John Doe -phone 98765432 -email johnd@example.com -address John street, block 123, #01-01` : registers a patient named `John Doe`.
* `enqueue 001A` : enqueues patient with reference id `001A` into the queue. The patient `001A` must be registered.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*AutoComplete & History*

* When the command box is blank, kbd:[UP] & kbd:[DOWN] will auto-fill the command box with commands previously entered. kbd:[UP] gives older commands and kbd:[DOWN] gives newer commands.

* When the command box is not blank, AutoComplete will come into action and tries to suggest commands that are available for whatever that has been typed. During which, you may traverse your selection of the suggestions via kbd:[UP] & kbd:[DOWN] then press kbd:[ENTER] to confirm selection.

*Command Format*

* Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `register -name <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `register -name John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `-name <NAME> [-tag <TAG>]` can be used as `-name John Doe -tag friend` or as `-name John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[-tag <TAG>]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `-tag friend`, `-tag friend -tag family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `-name <NAME> -phone <PHONE_NUMBER>`, `-phone <PHONE_NUMBER> -name <NAME>` is also acceptable.
* A Reference Id refers to a case-insensitive string, of 3 to 10 (inclusive) alphanumeric characters, that can be used to uniquely identify a person, such as a membership number or NRIC.
A `<PATIENT_REFERENCE_ID>` refers to the reference id which belongs to a patient. Whereas, a `<STAFF_REFERENCE_ID>` refers to the reference id of a staff doctor.
Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `register -name <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `register -name John Doe`.
