    "description": "This course examines changing discourses on evil from the eighteenth century to the aftermath of World War II; it explores shifts and developments in literary portrayals of the devil, varieties of theodicy, theories about the nature of human destructiveness, criminality, and the psychology of perpetrators of evil. Through a close reading of major works in philosophy and literature, we will pay particular attention to how understandings of evil have changed over time in response to both large scale socio-cultural transformations and traumatic historical events, such as the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the Holocaust.",
