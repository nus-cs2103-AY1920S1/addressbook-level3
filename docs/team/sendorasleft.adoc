== Project: Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)

---

== Overview

Every semester, administrators from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have to
systematically work their way through a heavy backlog of special requests, known as "appeals".
These appeals are usually made by frantic students during Module Registration,
a system where students register for their
desired courses in the upcoming academic term, and represent special circumstances that require
human judgement to resolve.

**The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)** is hence a desktop app that aims
to fuse a Command Line Interface (CLI) style command input with a triple-pane
GUI for easy navigation of appeals, module information, and student
particulars all in a single display. By combining the precision and speed of a CLI
input with the powerful side-by-side overview afforded by a GUI,
this app is particularly aimed towards *appeal
administrators who prefer to blaze through their heavy backload of appeals
without ever having to leave the comfort of the keyboard for their mouse*. MAMS aims
to be a self-contained application for fetching appeal, module, and student information, while
providing a complete suite of tools for intuitive navigation of the comprehensive data display and
resolving appeals. These include, but may not be limited to:

- A *powerful side-by-side triple-pane list cell display of appeal, module, and student data*, with commands to quickly navigate between
compact list views of multiple items and comprehensive expanded displays of single items.
- A *command history feature* for administrators to quickly cycle through and re-use old commands, while providing a comprehensive
and permanent log of all actions performed within the application.
- A *clash feature* that allows administrators to accurately determine any potential timetable clashes in appeal cases,
student workloads, or any two particular modules.
- A *find feature* that enables administrators to quickly locate specific appeal, module, and student data, narrowing down clutter within the display.
- An *add/remove module feature* that allows administrators to allocate or remove modules from students, while automatically checking for
potential hiccups like duplicate assignments.
- An *approve/reject feature* that allows administrators to close or resolve appeals in fast succession, and even provides functionality for mass operations.
- A *set credits feature* that provides administrator with the functionality to override allowable student workloads.
- An *undo/redo feature* to correct any recent unwanted data changes that may have been accidentally committed by the administrator.

MAMS is written primarily in Java, and features a GUI created with JavaFX, with CSS used to augment the GUI for improved user experience. It has about
13 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *a suite of history-related features and functionality*
** What it does:
- Gives administrators the ability to cycle through previous commands for auto-filling of the command-box using kbd:[&uarr;]/kbd:[&darr;] keys
- Keeps a permanent log of command execution by time-stamping each command, storing its result, and marking it according to execution success.
- Enables administrator to open a new window displaying all command history.
The display is updated in real-time, and can be filtered or toggled to hide verbose outputs.
It also uses hot-keys for mouse-less navigation and triggering of clipboard functions.
- Persistent serialization of command history to disk, with subsequent deserialization and loading on startup.

** Justification:
- Appeal resolution can drastically affect a student's academic career. It is hence extremely
important for the system (and those in supervisory positions over the administrators) to keep a permanent,
time-stamped, displayable and filterable log of all executed commands and actions that an administrator performs.
- Improves usability and convenience of the product significantly as administrators can easily recycle past commands using arrow keys, drastically cutting down
on monotonous and repetitive typing, which is crucial for a CLI-style application.
- History window can also provide real-time display of recently entered commands, helping administrators to keep on track through a real-time display of recent commands. It also further enhances convenience
by allowing users to quickly navigate through history (using hot-keys) and copy desired commands/parameters that may be too verbose or context-dependent to recall from memory
or identify from cycling through the arrow keys alone.
- Lastly but not exhaustively, persistent logging of history can allow administrators to quickly orientate themselves to what they did in a previous session,
allowing them to resume their work much more quickly.

** Highlights:
- This enhancement can have useful and interesting implications for future command development. For example, an `undo` command having the knowledge of all previously
executed commands, along with their details and execution status, can specifically target certain types of commands to be undone. Time-stamped history entries, along
with the record of successful/non-successful commands, can provide valuable work statistics for the admin/NUS. The independent serialization of command history to disk can allow MAMS to recover from
catastrophic data corruption by repeating the same sequence of commands on the original data source retrieved from NUS.
- This suite of history features was especially challenging as it required extensive end-to-end implementation across the whole of MAMS (from backend storage,
to model and logic, and finally to extensive changes and creation of new element in GUI). To integrate the entire suite of features into MAMS smoothly, it
required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives (eg. how existing commands can be made to access the history, placement of `CommandHistory`,
implementing real-time updates of the history window) in order for it to mesh well with the existing code architecture.

* *Minor enhancement*: Was solely in charge of the MAMS UI/UX. Re-worked entire GUI with revised layout/colour-scheme, and further improved the display and navigability of
the visual data by implementing `list` and `view` commands to switch between side-by-side compact list views and expanded card views.
