    "description": "The history of the Chinese demonstrates cases of total integration into the host society, of long-term coexistence and competition with it, and of a variety of options in between. It has produced a wondrous array of acculturative, adaptive, and assimilative phenomena. Chinese have been pulled towards different identities at various times, as Chinese sojourners abroad, as Westernized colonial subjects, as loyal citizens of their adopted countries, as revolutionary communists or modern multinational capitalists. This module will investigate the history of Chinese emigration through a comparative approach to its diaspora in diverse locals such as East and Southeast Asia, Europe, the Americas,and Australasia. A case study approach will be adopted in this module. The course is mounted for students at the senior levels with an interest in China and the Chinese overseas.",
