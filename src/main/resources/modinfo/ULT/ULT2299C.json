    "description": "Where does meaning come from? Some people think that it resides in the text; some suggest that it originates from the author; others argue that meaning is created by the reader. This module examines the possibilities and problems of the last answer. To what extent does the reader of a text determine its meaning? Is there a universal, objective reader, or are readers historically specific, biased and always \"subjects\"? If a reader constructs the text, can the text in turn construct the reader? We will think about these questions by operating on several levels: (1) by discussing literature and films that thematise reading; (2) by assessing how thinkers have debated the reader's role; and (3) by examining our own processes of reading.",
