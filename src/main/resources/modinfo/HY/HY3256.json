    "description": "Brides of the Sea', 'Gateways to Asia' and 'the transformers of Asia' are some of the ways scholars have described Asian port cities. Through case studies, this module explores the port city and the 'maritime world' in Asia. Students are introduced to the history of China's maritime world with a focus on the challenges it faced through encroachment by Western imperial powers. This module also examines Asia's colonial port cities, including Calcutta and Singapore, as sites of Western influence and modernization and also as sites of local resistance and transformation. This module is suitable for all students of NUS.",
