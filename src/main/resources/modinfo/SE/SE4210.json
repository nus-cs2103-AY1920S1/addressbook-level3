    "description": "Historical sources (writing) and archaeology (material culture) give very different perspectives on the development of civilisations. This module follows the development of classical civilisations in Southeast Asia from the first to the 16th centuries A.D. Data from archaeological excavations are utilised to create a picture of the achievements of early historic peoples of the region in such areas as the formation of kingdoms and cities; trade; architecture; and warfare. Relations with China and India are also analysed.",
