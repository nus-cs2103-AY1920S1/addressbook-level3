== Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio is to record my contribution to my software engineering project.

=== About the team
This project was done in a group of five, consisting of Shawn, Dominique, Jeun Hoe, Jun Hup and me. We are second-year
students in National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Computer Science.

=== About the project
This project is part of a software engineering module that I took during my second year. We were tasked to optimize
or morph a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop addressbook application for this project. We decided to morph the
application into a team management application called Athletick which caters to time-based sports.

This application enables coaches or captains to manage their team by recording attendance for
training sessions as well as track the performances of their athletes. One of the constraints set for this project is
that the primary input to the application has to be CLI as it is meant for users who can type fast and prefer typing
over the use of mouse. The duration of this project spanned over a period of 6 weeks.

This is what Athletick looks like when coaches or captains first launch the application:

The following is a list of our main features:

* Recording of attendance
* Recording of performance
* Viewing of attendance and performance on calendar
* Viewing of athlete's profile
* Undoing and redoing of commands

My role was to design and implement the feature that allows users to view the profile of an athlete. The following
sections will elaborate more on this feature which includes relevant documentation from the user and developer guides.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added:* I added the ability to view an athlete's profile.

* What it does: The `select` command allows users to view the profile of an individual athlete.

* Justification: There will be occasions when coaches or captains would like to track the progress of an athlete. The
`select` command allows them to view the athlete's personal information such as the name, phone number and email
address. The attendance rate and performance of the athlete is also displayed so that it is easier to monitor instead
of looking at the attendance and performance of all the athletes.

* Highlights:

** This feature works with other features such as `find` or `filter` which reduces the need to
 go through the list when looking for a specific athlete. For this feature, there were many design alternatives to
 consider as there are many ways it could be implemented. The current choice of design was used because it was
in line with the other features my group mates had implemented.

** I felt that the implementation was quite challenging because it requires a certain knowledge on how to use tools
such as JavaFX and SceneBuilder which were used to design the graphical user interface (GUI). With no prior experience, the learning
curve was steep which required more effort to learn about these tools.
