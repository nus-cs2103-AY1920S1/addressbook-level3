    "description": "This module aims to train students in the art and practice of play-writing while simultaneously offering them the opportunity to role-play the professional responsibilities and disciplines of a playwright. Topics to be covered include dramatic structure, dramatic action, the relationship between dialogue and action, characterisation, setting, the use of physical objects to create meaning, and different treatments of time on stage. Students will be assigned research and writing exercises throughout the module culminating in a full-length play. Students will also be expected to act in and direct other students scenes and plays as part of the continuous re-drafting and critique process.",
