== Introduction

Thank you for checking out TimeBook!
TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3).
TimeBook is a scheduling application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of you and your friends.
It also can find the common free time and venues among you and your friends.
TimeBook will have the following features:

. A graphical user interface (GUI) but most of the interactions with the application would happen using command line interface (CLI).
. Allows users to add the schedules of his or her friends and organise them into groups.
. Deconflict different schedules of different people and different groups to find the common free time among them.
. Integration with NUSmods API to allow users to enter their NUSmods timetable link to add it to their schedule.
. Integration with Google Maps API to allow the application to evaluate the best venue for the group to meet up during the free time in their schedules.

== Understanding this guide

=== Basic Information

This guide explains how you can use *TimeBook* to the fullest extent to assist you to plan for your group's meeting.

You can find the steps needed to start scheduling group activities with your friends or loved ones in the <<Quick Start, *quick start section*>> and general *lifecycle* usage of our application.
If you happen to stumble upon some difficulties, our <<FAQ,*Frequently Asked Questions*>> (FAQ) is here to address that.
If you are an experienced *Command Line Interface (CLI)* user, you can hop right into using the application by looking at our <<Command Summary, *Command Summary*>>.
Otherwise, take a look at the <<Inexperienced CLI user, *Inexperienced CLI User*>> section to obtain more information on how to use our application.

== Inexperienced CLI user

Unlike most applications, where you use your mouse to interact with the application such as scrolling and clicking, our application mostly use the *Command Line Interface*.
Most of the time, you would be interacting with the application through typing commands in the command box of the application.

You can play around with the commands in <<Command Summary, *Command Summary*>> to get yourself warmed up.

== GUI Components

In this section, you will learn more about the different components of our application.
Here is an overview of all of the components in our application:

image::guiComponents.png[]

=== MenuBar

You may use the menu bar to access file or exit the application.

image::menuBar.png[]

=== Schedule Display

The schedule display is the main component that you will be looking at to look schedules of yours or others!

image::scheduleDisplay.png[]

==== How to read the schedule view

Unsure of how to read the combined schedules of your friends in TimeBook? Here is a simple example to guide you!

TimeBook ensures that the leftmost column will always start from today's date. Each unnumbered coloured block belongs to
someone's schedule in the group. For example, the image below highlights all of Charlie's schedule.

image::charlieBusyTimeslot.png[]

Take note of the numbered green boxes you see below!

image::freeTimeslot.png[]

These are the common free time slot that you and your *entire* group members share! You can use
these numbered green boxes to arrange your meetings or share it with your group members to pick.

****

image:./icons/important.png[] Note that the labels for each of the coloured block will become hidden if each block becomes too small!
To get more information about the coloured block, you can just hover your mouse over it! +

****

=== Tabs

Tabs will contain your contacts and your groups.
You can use it to see all your existing contacts and groups!

image::tabs.png[]

=== Result Display Box

This box shows you whether your command executed is successful or unsuccessful.
If you encounter an error message here, look at our <<FAQ,*Frequently Asked Questions*>> section to see what is the cause of error.

image::resultDisplayBox.png[]

=== Command Box

Type your commands here to execute them!

image::commandBox.png[]

// tag::suggestions-autocomplete[]
=== Suggestions Autocomplete

TimeBook comes with a helpful feature that provides suggested commands or relevant values so you can spend less time typing commands and more time on your group meetings.

When you type a command, TimeBook will show a dropdown with similarly matching commands.
For example, you type in the command `add`.
TimeBook will then suggest commands such as `addevent`, `addgroup`, `addperson` like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step1.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

If you meant to type the `addevent` command, you can immediately select it by pressing the kbd:[Tab] key.
Otherwise, you can pick other options by using the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow keys and then hit the kbd:[Tab] key to confirm your selection.
For now, try selecting the `addtogroup` command using the kbd:[Down] and kbd:[Tab] keys.
TimeBook will complete the command like this:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step2.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

*****
image:./icons/lightbulb.png[] You can type an abbreviated version of any command as long as the letters are in order!
For example, instead of typing `addtogroup`, try `atg`.
*****

Remember how TimeBook can also suggest relevant values?
Let's try that by specifying a person's name using the `n/` parameter like so:

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step3.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

Again, TimeBook provides useful suggestions, in this case, the names of the people we've previously added.
Now, try using the kbd:[Tab] key to immediately fill in "Bobby".

image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step4.png[width=50%,pdfwidth=50vw]

Now, let's complete the `addtogroup` command.
Let's add Bobby to the Friends group by typing `g/` and using the suggestions to help us pick the Friends group.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step5.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step6.png[]
|=======

Let's say we change our mind and don't want to add Bobby to the Friends group.
No problem, just remove Bobby's name and pick someone else using the familiar kbd:[Up], kbd:[Down] and kbd:[Tab] keys.
TimeBook is smart enough to only fill in the name parameter and won't mess up the rest of your command.

[width="100%",cols="^3,^1,^3",frame="none",grid="none",valign="middle"]
|=======
a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step7.png[] | –kbd:[Tab]–> a|image::command-suggestions/user-guide-example-step8.png[]
|=======

Congratulations!
You've now mastered the suggestions feature using just three simple keys, the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow keys to navigate between suggestions and the kbd:[Tab] key to select it.
// end::suggestions-autocomplete[]

The following sections will explain all the commands we have in TimeBook and what they do.

*****
image:./icons/lightbulb.png[] You can use the command `scroll` to help you scroll the schedule view without touching your mouse!

image:./icons/lightbulb.png[] You can use the command `togglenext` to help you show next week's schedule!
After you've reached the fourth week's schedule, the next `togglenext` command will reset the schedule view back to the first week's schedule.

*****

==== Look at some members: `lookat`
Suppose that all of your group members are extremely busy and the common free time is too short to do any productive work,
you may use the `lookat` command to see if you can meet with some of your group members. You must be viewing a group's
schedule in order for this command to work.

Format:

* `lookat [n/Name]...`

The `lookat` command takes in any number of `n/Name` and highlights the group members according to name.

Example:

Suppose your group schedule looks like the one below.
//Image1

* Simply type `lookat n/Bobby n/Denise` if you are interested in inspecting both of their schedules!
You should see that Bobby's and Denise's schedule become highlighted.
//Image2

*****
image:./icons/important.png[] Empty blocks represent the free time slots for the group members that you are looking at.
The green blocks still represent the common free time slots for the entire group.

=== Closest Common Location

TimeBook will also help you to decide where to meet for your project meetings by suggesting to you which
location is the center for everyone. The center location is the closest location for everyone to meet in NUS based
on their schedule. In time book we define the center location for everyone as the _closest common location_.

*Steps*

. Setup your group by:
.. Adding your group members to your TimeBook with `addperson` command
.. Adding your group to TimeBook with `addgroup` command
.. Add your group members to your group with `addtogroup` command
. Find the free common time when you want to meet with `show` command
. With the free time slot `id` get the details for the closest common location with `popup` command
. Press `esc` button to close the popup

*Constraints*

Due to the lack of internet connectivity, TimeBook will only support locations that are in NUSMods and identifiable by Google Maps.
The full list of the supported locations is below.

*Definitions*

. We define closest common location as the location that requires the least average distance to travel to from different sources by car.
. Locations that are not supported are voided and are not used for the calculations of the closest common location and average travelling distance.
. Refer to the `Developer Guide` on how we compute the closest common location.

==== Closest Common Location Popup `popup`

command: `popup g/ GROUP_NAME i/ID`

Examples:

* `popup g/CS2103T i/2`

image::gmaps/SuccessfulPopup.png[SuccessfulPopup]

=== Saving the data

TimeBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +

== FAQ
[qanda]
[[alice-notice]]
Who is Alice? / How do I store my details and schedule?::
// tag::alice-full[]
// tag::alice-brief[]
When you first start using TimeBook, it will create a hidden person called `Alice` to store your details and schedule. This profile will be a member of every group you create.
// end::alice-brief[]
 +
{nbsp} +
To personalize TimeBook and make it yours, rename `Alice` by entering the command `edituser n/Your Name Here`. If you'd like to fill in more details, you can do so using the <<edit-user-command,`edituser` command>>.
// end::alice-full[]
+
{nbsp} +
How do I transfer my data to another Computer?::
 Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TimeBook folder.
+
{nbsp} +
Why can I enter irrelevant arguments?::
We understand that users occasionally make error while typing and it is frustrating for the application to fail because
of it. Thus for all commands that do not require any arguments(ie `help`, `home` and `exit`), TimeBook allows you to
enter any value after the command word. For example `help 1` will execute `help` command eventhough `1` is irrelevant to
the command. We hope with this feature you will have a seamless and pleasant experience with TimeBook.
+
{nbsp} +
Help! I encountered an error!::
We understand that you may encounter a weird error message and are unsure of what it means so we prepared this section that describes the uncommon errors that you may see.

| Clash in events | There is already a pre-existing event that is happening at that time slot.
| Duplicate Mapping | This person is already in the group.
| Cannot find closest location | The closest common location cannot be determined because everyone is not in NUS.
| XXX does not exist | This person or group does not exist in TimeBook. Some names are case-sensitive.
| No schedule to XXX | This error occurs when you use `scroll` and `togglenext` command when there is no schedule shown.
