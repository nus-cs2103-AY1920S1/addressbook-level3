    "description": "This course examines ASEAN\u2019s ongoing metamorphosis into a rules-based, tri-pillared (political-security, economic, and socio-cultural) Community pursuant to the mandate of the 2007 ASEAN Charter. It deals primarily with Law but is also attentive to the Non Law and Quasi Law aspects inherent in ASEAN\u2019s character as an international actor and regional organisation; its purposes and principles; and its operational modalities, processes, and institutions. Students will grasp the complexities of ASEAN\u2019s conversion to the rule of law and rule of institutions within the context of international law and its frameworks; national competences and jurisdiction; and regional relations and realpolitik.",
