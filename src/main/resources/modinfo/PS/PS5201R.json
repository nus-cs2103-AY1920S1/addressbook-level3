    "description": "This is a core module in political theory designed for students in any subfield of political science. It selectively examines both the history of the subject and current ideas, theorists, and methodologies. Particular attention is given to alternative understandings of the activity of theorising (e.g. scientific explanation, historical explanation, cultural interpretation, moral prescription, and philosophical analysis of concepts and presuppositions) and to debates about the character and aims of political theorising.",
