== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The architecture diagram below gives an overall view of NUStudy's structure. Each component
will be explained in more detail in the coming sections.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for initializing and shutting down the application, linking and cleaning up where necessary.

The `commons` package contains classes used by multiple other components, of which `LogsCenter` is important
as it is used for logging. The rest of NUStudy consists of four primary components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of NUStudy.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds application data in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to disk.

Each of the four components defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component
and exposes the API using a `{Component Name}Manager` class. For example, the `Logic` component
(see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Inter-component interaction

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `deletenote 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command

[[Design-Ui]]
=== `UI`

.Class diagram of the `UI` component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`NoteListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract
`UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

This component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== `Logic`

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Class diagram of the `Logic` component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AppDataParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker × but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== `Model`

.Class diagram of the `Model` component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component is independent of the other three primary components of NUStudy.
It stores application data – notes, questions and revision tasks – as well as a `UserPrefs` object
representing the user's preferences. It also exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Note>` that is bound to the UI,
so any data changes are immediately user-visible.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== `Storage`

.Class diagram of the `Storage` component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component reads and writes `UserPrefs` objects and NUStudy data in JSON format.

== Implementation

This section describes some finer details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::lecimage[]
=== Image support for lecture notes
==== Implementation

(Implementation of image support for lecture notes)

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

==== Design considerations: where to place the image?

* _Alternative 1:_ Images are shown within each lecture note in the first column, and each lecture note
shows all of its title, content and image
** Pros: Easier to implement (FXML does not have to reach into other places)
** Cons: Scrolling through lecture notes, all with images, takes time
* _Alternative 2:_ Place the images in the second column, below their corresponding title and content.
** Pros: More visually appealing, and by keeping just one note in the second column it becomes a
kind of flash card
** Cons: Harder to implement (FXML must reach into the object representing the second column)
// end::lecimage[]

=== Logging

We use `java.util.logging` for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (see <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`,
which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Log messages are written to the console and to a `.log` file.

*Logging levels*

* `SEVERE`: Indicates a critical (potentially fatal) problem with NUStudy.
* `WARNING`: After this incident NUStudy may continue, but with caution.
* `INFO`: Informational reports about actions taken by NUStudy.
* `FINE`: Strictly only useful for debugging purposes, records all data processed by NUStudy.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

The user preferences file location and logging level can be set through the configuration file,
by default `config.json`.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
