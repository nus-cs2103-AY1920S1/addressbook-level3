* If you want to manage your food items without hassle, iFridge is the application made for you!
* This application is made for tech savvy individuals to manage the food in their fridge, control Wastage, and create Shopping Lists.
* This is a desktop application for managing Food in a Fridge. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a Command Line Interface.
* With reminders for food expiring soon and periodic feedback about the waste generated, iFridge will make sure you review and minimize waste.
* You can create template lists (list of items that you would like to have in your fridge at any time).
* And, with a single command, you can generate a shopping list of items that are in your template list but not yet there in the Fridge!
