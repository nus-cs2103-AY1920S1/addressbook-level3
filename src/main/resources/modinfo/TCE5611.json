    "description": "The primary objective of this module is to equip civil\nengineering students with sufficient design knowledge and\nskills on precast structural concrete both for their further\neducation and for their future engineering career. This\nmodule provides students with fundamental approaches in\ndesigning precast concrete components and structures.\nThe students will acquire fundamental knowledge and\napproaches to section analysis and design, design of\nconnections, floor diaphragm action, precast frame\nstructures and precasat components. The module is\ntargeted at MSc civil engineering students and those with a\nkeen interest on precast concrete technology.",
