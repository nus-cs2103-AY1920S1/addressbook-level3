    "description": "Religion is a field of meanings that informs individual people's lives and also underpins social and political identities. While religions in Southeast Asia can be harnessed towards state construction or consolidation, they can also be embraced in ways that escape official control. In the past, religion has enabled people, through their local cults, religious schools, or social movements, to cope with daily existence or even voice their discontent. This module takes a comparative perspective and highlights the theoretical and practical problems related to this field of study.",
