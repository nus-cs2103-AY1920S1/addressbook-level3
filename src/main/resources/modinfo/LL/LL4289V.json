Second, it focuses on the evolution of arbitration, in particular, on the development of the procedures and substantive law that have gradually enabled arbitration to become a meaningfully autonomous legal system. Third, it surveys a variety of explanations for why the arbitral order has evolved as it has \u2013 into a more 'judicial-like' legal order \u2013 focusing on the role of arbitral centres, state regulatory competition, and the reasoning of tribunals in their awards.",
