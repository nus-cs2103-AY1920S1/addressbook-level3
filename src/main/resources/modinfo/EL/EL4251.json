    "description": "This module provides an overview of key social theories that explore the nature of language and its social foundations. Through an examination of how language occupies a central position in contemporary social theory, it considers how such insight may be incorporated into the study of language in social context. In particular, it explores how different social theories may offer varying perspectives on the socially embedded nature of language, linguistic constitution of social relations, and language as power.",
