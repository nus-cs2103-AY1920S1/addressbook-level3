    "description": "This freshman seminar will engage students in critical understanding of romantic love. The notion of romantic love, expressed through courtship and marriage, is ubiquitous in popular culture. In our everyday lives, we embrace being in love as a pre-condition for couple-hood and marriage. But what is love? The seminars will investigate love as a social construct, and examine the various social and cultural factors that influence how we appreciate and understand romantic love in contemporary societies.",
