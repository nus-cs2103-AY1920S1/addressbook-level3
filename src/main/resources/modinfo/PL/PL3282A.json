The design aims to provide students a broad overview of methodologies as well as a deeper understanding of the important issues in interpersonal relationship research. In the second half of the module, students would carry out group projects, applying their knowledge to conducting a research study. They will have hands-on experiences at different research stages, from how a research study is formulated, crystallized and carried out to data analysis, results presentation and writing-up.",
