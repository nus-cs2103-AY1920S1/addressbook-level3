    "description": "Modernity may be post\u2010traditional, but it is far from being thoroughly\nrationalized. Social meanings remain central, and the new approach of\n\u201ccultural sociology\u201d has emerged to study them. Providing an introduction to\ncultural sociology, this course focuses on one of its research programs \u2013 the\nstudy of material objects as iconic symbols. We begin with aesthetic theories\nof sensuous form and cultural theories of symbols and myth, then examine\nempirical studies ranging from motorcycle boys to Giacometti and\ncelebrities, from to vinyl records to the role of branded cultural consumption\nin post\u2010industrial societies.",
