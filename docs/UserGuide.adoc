== Introduction



MooLah is a hassle-free expense tracker for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expenses*.
More importantly, MooLah is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). MooLah supports user-friendly input format and
aliases that greatly improves the efficiency of CLI operations. It also supports recurring expenses and includes menus
from canteens of National University of Singapore for students to track their everyday food expenses in a second.
If you can type fast, MooLah can get your expense management tasks done much faster than traditional GUI expense
trackers.

=== Basic Expense-related Commands
==== Adding an expense: `addexpense`

This is MooLah's fundamental feature: you can add your expenses.

Format: `addexpense d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY [t/TIMESTAMP]`

****
* If you don't specify the time, your expense will be added with its time being the current system time.
* You should only input one of the following into the CATEGORY field: FOOD, TRAVEL, TRANSPORT, SHOPPING, UTILITIES, HEALTHCARE, ENTERTAINMENT, EDUCATION, OTHERS.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addexpense d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/10-10`
* `addexpense d/Buffet c/Food p/250`
* `addexpense d/Chicken rice p/2.50 c/Food t/yesterday noon`

==== Listing all expenses : `listexpenses`

You can list every single expense you have added into MooLah.

Format: `listexpenses`

==== Updating an expense: `editexpense`

Made a mistake? You can edit expenses too.

Format: `edit INDEX [p/PRICE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TIMESTAMP] [c/CATEGORY]...`

Example:

`edit 2 p/3.50`
Updates the price of the 2nd expense in the current list to 3.50.


****
* Edits the expense at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You can set the time of the expense to the system’s current time by typing `t/` without specifying a time.
****

==== Locating expenses by name: `find`

You can find expenses whose description contains any of the keywords you inputted.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `chicken` will match `Chicken`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Puff Curry` will match `Curry Puff`
* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `chick` will not match `chicken`
* Expenses matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. an expense with description
`Chicken rice`, and expense with description `Duck Rice` will both match `rice`
****

Examples:

* `find rice` returns `chicken rice` and `duck rice`.
* `find chicken taxi schoolfee` returns any expense having description containing `chicken`, `taxi`, or `schoolfee`.

==== Deleting an expense: `deleteexpense`

You can also delete an expense from the expenses list in MooLah.

Format: `deleteexpense INDEX`

****
* Deletes the expense at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

```
listexpenses
delete 2
```
Deletes the 2nd expense in the list of expenses, shown by `list`.

```
list
find chicken
delete 1
```
Deletes the 1st expense in the results of the `find` command.

=== Basic Event-related Commands

Events are pretty similar to expenses, except that they denote potential expenses that they may happen in the future.
You should use this feature to keep track of future important events in your life that would require you to spend some money
(e.g. your friends' birthdays).

At launch, MooLah will remind you of your upcoming events. Any transpired events would also appear as popups,
asking you whether you wish to add these events as corresponding expenses.

image::TranspiredEventsPopup.png[width="790"]

==== Adding an event: `addevent`

Events share the same fields as expenses, so you add them the same way.

Format: `addevent d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY t/TIMESTAMP`

****
* Events are potential future expenses, so the `TIMESTAMP' field is compulsory and should contain a future time.
* You should only input one of the following into the CATEGORY field: FOOD, TRAVEL, TRANSPORT, SHOPPING, UTILITIES, HEALTHCARE, ENTERTAINMENT, EDUCATION, OTHERS.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addevent d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/two weeks from now`
* `addevent d/Family buffet c/Food p/250 t/31-12`
* `addevent d/Bangkok plane tickets t/tomorrow p/200 c/Travel`

==== Listing all events : `listevents`

You can list every single event you have added into MooLah.

Format: `listevents`

==== Updating an event: `editevent`

You can edit events the same way you edit expenses.

Format: `edit INDEX [p/PRICE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [t/TIMESTAMP] [c/CATEGORY]...`

Example:

`editevent 2 p/300`
Updates the price of the 2nd event in the current list to 300.


****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****
==== Deleting an event: `deleteevent`

You can also delete an event from the events list in MooLah.

Format: `deleteevent INDEX`

****
* Deletes the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

```
listevents
delete 2
```
Deletes the 2nd event in the list of events, shown by `listevents`.

==== (Coming in v2.0) Converting any currency to preferred currency : `convert`

=== Let's Do Budgeting

Feel a need to cut your spending? Try the awesome budgeting feature!
It can help you cultivate better financial management habits in the following ways:

* Each budget has a progress bar with a percentage, which indicates how much you have
spent as a proportion to the limit.
* The color of the progress bar implies the following 4 situations:
- GREEN: Less than half of the limit.
- YELLOW: Spent half of the limit.
- ORANGE: Reached 90% of the limit.
- RED: Exceeded the limit.
* When your expenses reach 90% of the limit, it will give a warning to remind you to
cut down on your spending.
* When your expenses exceed the budget limit, it will give another warning. However,
the percentage will continue to update even if it exceeds 100%, to give you a better idea
of how much you have overspent.

==== Create a new budget : `addbudget`
Want your expenses tracked under a recurring budget? Simple enough with this command: `addbudget`

The concrete format is:
----
addbudget d/DESCRIPTION p/AMOUNT sd/START_DATE pr/PERIOD
----

For example, after typing
----
addbudget d/school p/300 sd/01-10-2019 pr/month
----
You'll see that a new budget "school" is created, and set to $300, recurring monthly, starting from 1st October 2019.

Tips:

* 4 types of budget periods are supported, namely `day`, `week`, `month`, and `year` (all in lower case).
* The year in start date is optional, i.e. you can simply input `01-10` and the year will be automatically set
to the current year.
* The start date can be any time in the past or future, the budget period will automatically
normalize to the current period.
For example, if today is `23-10-2019`, when you type `sd/01-07 pr/month`, the resulting budget period
will be `01-10-2019 to 31-10-2019`, since that's the period anchored by today's date.
* All budgets are recurring. Continuing from the example above, at 1 Nov 2019, you'll see the budget's period refreshed
to `01-11-2019 to 30-11-2019`, and all past expenses archived, giving you an empty budget panel to start with.

==== Switch between budgets : `switchbudget`
Now that you've successfully added a few different budgets, wonder how to toggle between them? Try this magical command:
`switchbudget`, which switches the primary budget to any other budget in one shot!

The concrete format is:
----
switchbudget d/BUDGET_NAME`
----

For example, suppose you're at primary budget `school` now.

After typing:
----
switchbudget d/outside school
----

You will see that the primary budget panel is switched from `school` to `outside school`. Every expense you add
from now on will be tracked under the "outside school" budget instead.

==== List all budgets: `listbudgets`
To get an overview of all the budgets at hand, simply type:

----
listbudgets
----
You'll see a list of all budgets in MooLah.

Tips:

* The primary budget is marked with a red border.
* To go back to primary budget panel, type `view Primary Budget`.

==== Edit a budget: `editbudget`
A typo? On a second thought? No worries, you can easily modify your budget with `editbudget`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget INDEX d/DESCRIPTION p/AMOUNT sd/START DATE pr/PERIOD
----

For example, if the second budget shown in the list is "school", recurring monthly, amount set at $300,
refreshed on the first day of each month, after typing:

----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget 2 d/school expenses p/400 sd/05-10
----

It will change to "school expenses", capped at $400, refreshed on the 5th of every month.

Tips:

* You can choose to edit any of these 4 attributes of a budget: `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT`, `START DATE`
and `PERIOD`, more than one at a time.

==== Delete a budget (by name) : `deletebudget`
Don't want it any more? Use `deletebudget` to say bye to your budget!

The concrete format is:
----
deletebudget d/BUDGET_NAME
----

For example, after typing:

----
deletebudget d/school
----

The budget with the name "school" will be deleted.

==== Delete a budget (by index) : `deletebudgetid`
If budget names are too long, there's an easier way to delete them: `deletebudgetid`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudgets (first go to list of budgets)
deletebudget INDEX
----
You'll see the corresponding budget disappear from the list.

Tips:

* Regretted? Type `undo` to get it back ;D

==== Delete all budgets: `clearbudgets`
Don't feel like living on budgets any more? You can clear them all, just by a simple command:
`clearbudgets`.

==== View expenses in a different period: `switchperiod`
Wanna see your archived expenses in the past? The command `switchperiod` is the time machine you need.

The concrete format is:
----
switchperiod t/DATE
----

For example, suppose you have a monthly budget "school", refreshed at the first day of each month; and
suppose it is November now.
After typing:
----
switchperiod t/01-05
----
You'll see all expenses tracked under "school" from 1 May to 31 May this year.

Tips:

* The time machine can only travel *back* in time! That is, if the date is in the current or future period, you'll need
to input again.
* Only expenses tracked under *the current budget* are shown.

=== Creating an alias for your favourite commands : `alias`
Assign a full parameterized input to an alias.

Format: `alias a/ALIAS_NAME c/COMMAND_WITH_PARAMETERS`

E.g.
`alias a/chicken rice c/ add d/ Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food`
Result creates an alias “chicken rice” for the command which adds an expense of 2.50 under the Food category with a
description of “Chicken Rice” at the current system time.

- Note: all white spaces characters will be removed from alias names
- Note: aliases with names of official commands cannot be made
- Note: using the same name for an alias will overwrite the existing alias if it exists

=== Saving the data
Expense tracker data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

=== Viewing Statistics
==== Summary : `stats`
Produces statistics regarding the user’s expenses.

The statistics is in the form of a pie chart, where every piece represents the combined expenditure of all expenses
under the category, taken as a percentage of the total expenditure in the budget the command was called.

Format: `stats [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE]`

- Date formats accepted include `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD-MM`, where the year will be taken as the current year if it is
not specified.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, statistics is calculated from one month after `START_DATE`

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, statistics is calculated from one month before `START_DATE`

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics is calculated from one month before the current date.

Example:
`stats`
`stats sd/12-12-2018`
`stats sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018`

==== Compare : `statscompare`
Produces and displays statistics regarding the user’s finance for 2 time periods.
The statistics include all categories of items, the number of entries and the total expenditure of all expenses under
the category.
The number under each cell represents the difference using `second period – first period`.

Format: `statscompare sd1/START_DATE_1 sd2/END_DATE pr/PERIOD`

- Date formats accepted include `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD-MM`, where the year will be taken as the current year if it is not
specified.

- `PERIOD` takes in either of the following keywords: week, month, year

NOTE[Work in progress]:
- day is ideally recognised as a keyword to `PERIOD`

- If day is given as a keyword under `PERIOD`, statistics will be calculated from 12:00am of the day till 11:59pm of
the same day

Examples:
`statscompare sd1/01-01-2019 sd2/01-02-2019 pr/month`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`
