    "description": "The role of symmetry in geometry was first understood clearly by Felix Klein in the late 19th century. Since then, transformations (specifically, rigid motions) have been an increasingly studied topic in geometry, and elsewhere in mathematics. However, the intricate connection between rigid motions and beautiful results about well-studied geometric configurations is rarely made explicit. This course will study rigid motions of the plane, with special attention to the insights they provide into plane geometry.",
