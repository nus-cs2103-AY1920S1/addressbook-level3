== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

This section will illustrate and detail the overall design of the software for treasurerPro.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

This section illustrates the overall architecture of the software for treasurerPro.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of treasurerPro.

treasurerPro is divided primarily into 6 packages which contain implementation for each tab in the UI:

. Transaction package: Home tab
. Person package: Members tab
. Reimbursement package: Reimbursements tab
. Inventory package: Inventory tab
. Cashier package: Cashier tab
. Overview package: Overview tab

Each package uses either TXT or JSON based storage.
Within the package, they share a similar structure, consisting of the following components:

. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the package.
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands sent to that package.
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the package in-memory.
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The details on the structure of these components are located in the next few sections.
Alternatively, clicking on the names in the above list will bring you to the respective section.

Apart from the components above, treasurerPro also has the following shared components:

. `Main`
. `Commons`

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes each package in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down each package and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `Log Center` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

Commands in treasurerPro are tab-specific.
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` in the Transactions tab.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command within the Home tab.
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

A command inputted by the user is received by `MainWindow`, and forwarded to the respective `Logic` according to the tab the user is currently on.
Further details of the interactions between `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` are given below.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI component consists of a `MainWindow` that holds both a `TabPane` and a `Lion`.
The `TabPane` holds multiple `Tab` objects, for example, `Transactions` and `Cashier`.
The `Lion` consists of a `ScrollPane` that holds messages that are to be displayed to the user.

All these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the respective package's `Logic` component.
* Updates itself with modified data whenever changes are made by the user.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

This section will show the structures of the `Logic` component of the different tabs.
The diagram below shows a generalised view of the `Logic` component within the packages.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Generalised `Logic` Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

An outline of how a command is processed through `Logic` is as follows:

. `Logic` uses the tab's `Parser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person, transaction).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui` (not depicted).

A general Sequence Diagram depicting the above outline is shown below:

[[GeneralLogicSD]]
.Sequence Diagram for execution within `Logic`.
image::GeneralSequenceDiagram.png[]

Further details on the implementation of the `Parser` and `Command` can be found below in <<RTLogic, Section 2.3.1. Home and Reimbursements Tab>>,
<<ICLogic, Section 2.3.2. Inventory and Cashier Tab>> and <<PLogic, Section 2.3.3. Members Tab>> below.

image::OverviewLogicDiagram.png[]

The parsers represented by the `ABCParser` are:

* `SetCommandParser`
* `NotifyCommandParser`

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

This section will show the structures of the `Model` Component of the different tabs.
The diagram below shows a generalised view of the `Model` component within the packages.

.Structure of the Generalised `Model` Component
image::ModelCD.png[]

[NOTE]
`XYZObjects` are only present in the `transaction`, `reimbursement`, `person`, `cashier` and `inventory` packages.

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for the Home Tab

The `Model` of the Home tab:

* stores a `TransactionList` object that represents the list of all transactions data
* stores a `Predicate<Transaction>` object to filter the list of all transactions
* stores another `TransactionList` object that represents the filtered list of transactions according to the predicate

*API for transaction package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/transaction/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for the Reimbursements Tab

The `Model` of the Reimbursment tab:

* stores a `ReimbursementList` object that represents the list of all reimbursements data
* stores another `ReimbursementList` object that represents the filtered list of reimbursements according to the command

*API for reimbursements package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/reimbursement/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for the Members Tab

The `Model` of the Members tab:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences for `person` package.
* stores the Address Book data for `person` package.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

*API for person package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/person/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for the Inventory Tab

To be filled in :)

*API for inventory package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/inventory/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for the Cashier Tab

The `Model` of the Cashier tab:

* stores an `InventoryList` object that represents the list of all items in the inventory
* stores a list of sales items present on the table of the Cashier tab
* accesses the `TransactionList` object from transaction package that represents the list of all transactions data

[NOTE]
This `Inventory List` is different from the one in the `Model` of inventory package.
This is so that the `Inventory List` in the `Model` of cashier package cannot add or delete any items in the inventory.
This means that `Inventory List` in cashier package access different set of methods which modifies only the quantity of the item.

*API for cashier package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/cashier/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Details on the `Model` Implementation for the Overview Tab

The `Model` of the Overview tab:

* stores an array of 6 double values representing the budget goal, expense goal, sales goal, budget threshold, expense threshold and sales threshold respectively
* stores three booleans indicating whether notifications for budget, expenses and sales have already been shown, valid for the current session only
* exposes getter and setter method to read and write the goals and thresholds
* does not depend on any of the other components

*API for overview package* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/overview/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

This section will show the structures of the `Storage` component of the different tabs.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented and works.

There are a total of 6 tabs in our application for each feature: Home tab, Members tab, Reimbursement tab,
Inventory tab, Cashier tab, Overview tab.

=== Home Tab

This tab will help to show records of individual transactions from miscellaneous spending, revenue from sales and cost of buying items to sell.
Each transaction will require an input of its date, description, category, amount and member that is accountable for it.

Revenue from each cashier checkout will also be automatically inputted as a transaction with *positive* amount in this tab with the person being the cashier.
The inputted transactions that corresponds to a spending with a *negative* amount will be tabulated for each member in the reimbursement tab to keep track of reimbursements.

==== Add Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Add command feature in the Home tab.
This feature adds transaction to the table and data file.
All fields in the transactions are compulsory to be inputted by the user: date, description, category, amount, person full name.
The person's name inputted has to match a name already existing in the `AddressBook` which is shown in the Members tab.

Thus, this feature requires access to the `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel#getPersonByName` inside the person package which contains the `AddressBook` implementation to check for the validity of the name entered when inside `AddCommandParser` which creates the `Transaction` object.
The following Sequence Diagram shows how the `Transaction` object is created from `AddCommandParser` which is represented in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>
as a generic parser:

.Sequence Diagram of the Parser for the Add command
image::HomeAddCommandParser.png[]

These are the definitions of the methods shown above:

[[getPersonByName]]
* `AddCommandParser#parse(args, pd)`: It parses the given user input (args) and creates an `AddCommand` object.
* `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel#getPersonByName()`: It returns the `Person` object in `AddressBook` that matches the given name.

The `AddCommand` is created and the newly created `Transaction` object is passed into its constructor.
The following Sequence Diagram is the reference from <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>:

.Sequence Diagram of the Add command in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeAddCommandSD.png[]

These are the definitions of the methods shown above:

[[resetPredicate]]
* `Model#resetPredicate()`: It resets the `Predicate` object in `ModelManager` to evaluate all `Transaction` objects to true.
* `Model#addTransaction(transaction): It adds the given `Transaction` object to its `TransactionList` objects attributes.

Thus, when the `Model#resetPredicate()` method is called in the `AddCommand`, the UI table will immediately shows the full transaction list regardless of the list shown at the start of the <<activityDiagramAdd, Activity Diagram>>.
If the prior command was a Find command, then the list in the beginning of the Activity Diagram would be a filtered list but after the Add command is executed, the full list of transactions would be shown.

After the command is executed, the `LogicManager` updates the in-app list of transactions via the `ModelManager` and updates the data file via the `StorageManager`.
The following Sequence Diagram shows how the updating of the list of transactions in the app and in the data file:

[[updateTL]]
.Sequence Diagram of updating the transaction list in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeAddCommandMMSM.png[]

[NOTE]
This update of the list of transactions is done for every command that is executed successfully in the Home tab.

Finally, the `StorageManager` and `ModelManager` inside the Reimbursement package will be updated with the latest `TransactionList` object to generate an updated list of reimbursements for the user to view in the Reimbursements tab.
The following Sequence Diagram shows how the Reimbursements tab is updated from the `MainWindow`:

[[update-reimbursement]]
.Sequence Diagram of updating the reimbursement list in the Reimbursements tab (transaction package)
image::TUpdateRinMainWindow.png[]

[NOTE]
This update of the Reimbursements tab is done for every command after the list of transactions is updated (shown in <<updateTL, 3.1.1. Add Command Feature: Figure 15>>) when there is a command executed successfully in the Home tab.

[[activityDiagramAdd]]
To better illustrate the flow of events from the moment a user inputs a command till the completion of the command, the Activity Diagram for the Add command is shown below:

.Activity Diagram of the Add command in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeTabActivityDiagramAddCommand.png[]

As shown, when a user does not input all the compulsory fields or input a name that does not match anyone in the `AddressBook`, a response to inform the user of the incorrect input is shown and when a successful addition is done, a response message is shown as well by our mascot, Leo.

Since the Reimbursements tab tabulates the amount to be reimbursed to a person, if the inputted amount is a negative amount to indicate a spending that needs to be reimbursed, the Reimbursements tab will update and show this record.

[[DeleteCommandHome]]
==== Delete Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Delete command in the Home tab.
This feature allows for 2 types of deletion, by the index shown in the table or by the person's name.
Inputting the person's name will cause all transactions linked to that person to be deleted.The following Activity Diagram shows the steps needed to delete a new transaction:

.Activity Diagram of the Delete command in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeTabActivityDiagramDeleteCommand.png[]

The above Activity Diagram assumes the index to be within the bounds of the table but if it is not, a response will be shown about the incorrect input.
Also, as shown above, responses will be shown to indicate if an input is incorrect or when a successful deletion is done.

For the implementation, the `DeleteCommandParser` which is represented in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>> as a generic parser creates either a `DeleteIndexCommand` or `DeleteNameCommand` object according to the user input.
The following Sequence Diagram shows how the `DeleteNameCommand` is created with the definition of `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel#getPersonByName` defined in
<<getPersonByName, 3.1.1. Add Command Feature>>:

.Sequence Diagram of the parser for the Delete command to delete by the `Person` 's name
image::DeleteCommandParser.png[]

The following Sequence Diagram shows how the command to delete transactions according to the specified name works after it is created which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>:

.Sequence Diagram of the Delete command being executed in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeDeleteNameCommand.png[]

In addition, the `Model#resetPredicate()` method defined in <<resetPredicate, 3.1.1. Add Command Feature>> is not called in the `DeleteNameCommand`.
If the prior input is a Find command and the list at the start of the Activity Diagram shows a filtered list, the table in the UI will continue to show the filtered list after the current Delete Command.
To view the full transaction list, the user would be required to enter the back command where `BackCommand` calls `Model#resetPredicate()`.
The Sequence Diagram for the `BackCommand` is shown in the following section <<BackCommandSD, 3.1.3. Back Command Feature>>

After this, the list of transactions and the Reimbursement tab is updated as shown in <<updateTL, 3.1.1. Add Command feature: Figure 16>>
and <<update-reimbursement, 3.1.1. Add Command feature: Figure 17>>
respectively.

The implementation of the command to delete transactions according to the specified index would be similar but does not require interaction with the `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel` from the
`AddressBook` in the person package inside its branch in `DeleteCommandParser`.
In `DeleteIndexCommand`, it also calls the
`Model#findTransactionInFilteredListByIndex(index)` and `Model#deleteTransaction(index)` instead which deletes the `Transaction` object according to its position in the filtered transaction list.

==== Back Command Feature

[[BackCommandSD]]
This section explains the implementation of the Back command feature in the Home tab.
The `BackCommand` is called to show the full list of transactions when the table is showing a filtered list.
It is not initialised by a specific command parser as shown in as shown in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>
but initialised by the `TransactionTabParser` instead.
The following detailed Sequence Diagram shows how the Back command works:

.Sequence Diagram of the Back command being executed in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeTabBackCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Sort Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Sort Command feature in the Home tab.
The `SortCommand` allows for 3 types of sort, by name in alphabetical order, by amount (from least to most) and by date (from oldest to most recent).

The following Sequence Diagram shows how the Sort command works which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>:

.Sequence Diagram of the Sort command being executed in the Home tab (transaction package)
image::HomeTabSortSD.png[]

When a user inputs the Sort command, it is only checked that it is one of the 3 types or it will show a response about the incorrect user input.
When it is successfully sorted, there will also be a response message shown.

Similar to the Delete command in <<DeleteCommandHome, 3.1.2. Delete Command Feature>>, the `Model#resetPredicate()` method is not called.
If the UI table is showing a filtered list of transactions, the back command has to be entered to call that method from `BackCommand` to reset the predicate.

==== Overall Design Considerations

This section's table explains the design considerations for some implementations in the Home tab.

|===
|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 |Conclusion and Explanation

|`ModelManager` contains 2 variables that point to a `TransactionList` object in original order and a `TransactionList`
object for viewing that can be sorted such that when [blue]`sort reset` is called, the `TransactionList` for viewing can be set to be equals to the original one.
|`ModelManager` contains only the shown `TransactionList` that can be sorted and reads from the data file to get
the `TransactionList` object in original order when [blue]`sort reset` is called.
|Alternative 1 was implemented. Alternative 1 allowed exporting of the data file in the desired order anytime while treasurerPro was running while
alternative 2 meant that the data file would be updated only when treasurerPro is exited. The implementation is shown in <<lists, Figure 24>>, below the table.

|The Members tab's `Model` interface is passed as parameters into Home tab's `Logic` to give `Logic` access to all public methods
of `ModelManager`.
|A new interface is made to allow the only used method of Members tab's `ModelManager` to be accessed in Home tab's
`Logic`.
|Alternative 2 was implemented. The new interface acts as a facade for `ModelManager` which prevent unwanted modifications
to `AddressBook`. The interface implemented is `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel` as shown in <<facade, Figure 25>>, below the table.

|An `ArrayList` is used to store `Transaction` objects in `TransactionList`.
|A `LinkedList` is used to store `Transaction` objects in `TransactionList`.
|Alternative 1 was implemented. An `ArrayList` has better performance for the set and get methods than a `LinkedList` which would frequently used in `ModelManager`.

=== Members Tab

This tab will help to keep track of the contact details of members in the club or society for the treasurer.

==== Delete Command Feature

This feature allows for deletion by the index shown in the the Members tab.
This tab integrates the existing `AddressBook`.
The following Sequence Diagram shows how the Delete command works:

.Sequence Diagram of the Delete command in the Member tab (transaction package)
image::MembersDeleteSD.png[]

Before, the deletion is done, there will be a check to the `TransactionModel` to ensure that the member is not linked to any transaction records since every transaction must be linked to a `Person` in the `Members Tab` (`AddressBook`).

=== Reimbursements Tab

This tab helps to show reimbursements that the user has not paid to a person.
Each reimbursement is auto extracted from transactions and grouped by person in transactions.
So, each reimbursement shows the total amount that the user needs to reimburse a person.
And there can not be two reimbursements that refer to the same person.

The user can add deadline to a reimbursement, mark a reimbursement, find a reimbursement and sort reimbursements.

The following is an overview class diagram for `LogicManager` in reimbursement tab:

.Overview class diagram of reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabClassDiagram.png[]

And this is a
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-3/main/blob/master/docs/images/GeneralSequenceDiagram.png[general sequence diagram]
of command execution.
The detailed implementations of command execution in reimbursement tab are in the following section.

==== Deadline Command feature

This command is used to add a deadline date to a reimbursement for a person.
Deadline command requires access to the `Model` of the person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in.
Deadline field should be provided in a valid date format.
The person's name inputted has to match a person's name already existing in the `Reimbursement` which is shown in the Reimbursement tab.

The following Sequence Diagram shows the execution of Deadline command:

.Sequence Diagram of Deadline Command in the Reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSD.png[]

As shown, a user needs to add a deadline to a reimbursement by specifying the person's name and providing a date.
The `DeadlineCommandParser` creates a `DeadlineCommand` with person and deadline date information.
This `DeadlineCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager` of reimbursement and is executed by calling `addDeadline` method in
`ModelManager`.
After the operations, `LogicManager` gets updated reimbursement list from `ModelManager` and displays the deadline in reimbursement list.
After that, the deadline is saved into a `.txt` file.

.Activity Diagram of Deadline command in the Reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDeadlineCommand.png[]

As shown by the above activity diagram, when a user inputs a person who does not exist in any reimbursement or keys in an invalid data format, our app displays the expected format of the deadline command.
Otherwise, when the execution is successful, a response informs the user that deadline is successfully added to the reimbursement.

==== Find Command feature

This command is used to find a reimbursement that contains the person's name.
The Find command requires access to `Model` of the person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in.
Person field should be provided and the person's name should exist in reimbursement list.

.Sequence Diagram of Find Command in Reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementFindCommandSD.png[]

A user needs to find a reimbursement by providing the person's name.
As shown in the above figure, `FindCommand` is executed by calling `findReimbursement` method in
`ModelManager`.
After the operations, that reimbursement is returned and reimbursement tab only shows a `filteredList` which contains this single reimbursement.

[[ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramFindCommand]]
.Activity Diagram of Find Command in Reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramFindCommand.png[]

The above activity diagram shows the steps needed for Find command.
The person's name is checked whether it exists in reimbursement list.
If not, our app informs the user that command is incorrect.
If command is valid, the reimbursement is found and displayed in the tab.

==== Back Command feature

This command is used to return to the original list after executing Find command

.Sequence Diagram of Back Command in Reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementBackCommandSD.png[]

`BackCommand` execution updates `filteredList` inside `ModelManager` to the original full `reimbursementList`.
After the operations, the original full reimbursement list is displayed.

==== Done Command feature

This command is used to mark a reimbursement that has been done.
Done command requires access to `Model` of the person package.
Person field should be provided and the person's name should exist in reimbursement list.

[[ReimbursementDoneCommandSD]]
.Sequence diagram of done command execution in reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDoneCommandSD.png[]

A user needs to mark a reimbursement as done by specifying the person's name for the specific reimbursement.
The `DeadlineCommandParser` creates a `DoneCommand` with person's information.
As shown in the above figure, `DoneCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager`
and it is executed by calling `doneReimbursement` method in
`ModelManager`.
After the operations, the status of transactions that consist of this reimbursement is updated to `True`
and that reimbursement is deleted from the reimbursement list.
Then the updated reimbursement list is displayed and this new list without that deleted reimbursement is saved.

<<ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDoneCommand, The following activity diagram>> shows the steps needed for done command.
The person's name is checked whether it exists in reimbursement list.
If not, our app informs the user that command is incorrect.
If command is valid, the reimbursement containing the provided person's name is deleted from reimbursement list and will not be displayed.

==== Sort Command feature

This command is used to sort reimbursements and the user can choose to sort based on name, amount or deadline.

.Sequence Diagram of Sort Command in Reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementSortCommandSD.png[]

As shown in the above figure, `SortXYZCommand` is executed by calling `sortListByXYZ` method in
`ModelManager`.
And reimbursement list is sorted using `SortByXYZ` comparator.
For `SortAmountCommand`, the list will be sorted in descending order of absolute value of amount.
For `SortNameCommand`, the list will be sorted in descending alphabetical order of person's name.
For `SortDeadlineCommand`, the list will be sorted in the order that nearest deadlines are at the front.

==== Overall design considerations

This section's table explains the design considerations for some implementations in the reimbursement tab.

.Table of design considerations and comparisons
|===
|Aspect|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 |Conclusion and Explanation

|How [blue]`done` command in reimbursement tab updates transactions model and storage.
|The `reimbursementLogic` keeps a `transactionModel` and a `transactionStorage` to update transactions.
|`MainWindow` calls methods from `reimbursementLogic` and `transactionLogic` when a command is executed.
|Alternative 2 is chosen.
`transactionLogic` follows Façade pattern to prevent exposing the internal details of the transaction tab.
So, instead of directly manipulating model and storage of transactions from `reimbursementLogic`,
the operations are done through `transactionLogic` as shown in the <<facadeRe, code snippet>> below the table.

|How reimbursement records are saved and read from `.txt` files
|The reimbursement tab saves all the information of transactions that make up a reimbursement into `reimbursementInformation.txt`.
|The reimbursement tab only saves person's name, amount and the deadline information into `reimbursementInformation.txt`.
When launching the application, reimbursement tab reads the transactions information from `transactionHistory.txt`.
|Alternative 2 is chosen.
Alternative 2 does not save duplicate information that has already been saved into `transactionHistory.txt`.
So, alternative 2 is more efficient.

=== Inventory Tab

This tab will help to keep records of all items currently in the club’s possession.

Each item will require an input of its description, category, quantity, and cost per unit.
Optionally, if the item is meant for sale, the price can be inputted as well.

The following Class Diagram shows the architectural design of the tab:

.Class Diagram of Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::InventoryTabClassDiagram.png[]

==== Add Item Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Add command feature of the Inventory Tab,
which allows the addition of items to the inventory. These items are represented by `Item` objects.
The addition of an `Item` to the inventory requires an input of the `Item`’s description, category, quantity, and cost.
The price field is optional and may be added only to an `Item` meant for sale.

The following Sequence Diagram shows how the AddCommandParser creates an `Item`:

.Sequence Diagram of the Add command parser in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/AddCommandParserSeqDiagram.png[]

As seen in the above diagram, the parser takes in the user input as well as the existing `InventoryList`. Within the
parser, it will use the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the arguments using the prefixes. This creates an
`ArgumentMultimap`, allowing the system to retrieve the user input based on the prefixes that precede them. Thus, this
increases the accuracy of the parsing and allows the fields to be in any order in the user input.

If the description of the `Item` being added matches that of an existing `Item`, the new `Item`’s quantity is added to
that of the existing `Item` and the cost per unit is recalculated. This is handled within the `AddCommandParser`,
which also checks the validity of the input using the isValidNumericString(string) method.

The code for the `AddCommandParser#isValidNumericString(String)` can be seen in the code snippet below:

.Code snippet of the `AddCommandParser#isValidNumericString(String)` method in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/AddCommandSnippet.png[]

Through this method, the application prohibits the addition of an `Item` with any value equivalent to or greater than
10,000. This includes the total cost and expected revenue of each `Item`. It also prohibits non-numeric inputs where
numeric inputs are expected. The `AddCommandParser#isValidNumericString(String)` method performs the aforementioned
checks and returns a boolean that represents the validity of the input.

After the `Item` is created and the command is executed, the `LogicManager` updates the in-app `InventoryList` via the
`ModelManager` and saves to the data file via the `StorageManager`.

The following sequence diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the
AddCommand works:

.Sequence Diagram of the Add command in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/AddCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

For a greater understanding of the flow of events and checks, you may consult the following activity diagram that
shows the steps that follow the input of an Add command:

.Activity Diagram of the Add command in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/AddCommandFlowChart.png[]

==== Delete Item Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Delete command feature of the Inventory Tab, which allows the deletion
of items from the inventory. This feature requires only the command keyword and an index or description as input.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the
`DeleteCommand` works:

.Sequence Diagram of the Delete command in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/DeleteCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

The `DeleteCommandParser` is responsible for checking the validity of the input, and does not allow any indexes that
are less than 1 or greater than the largest index currently in the list. It can also take in a description as input and
compares it against existing `Item` s in the `InventoryList`. This comparison is case-insensitive.

After the command is executed and the `Item` is deleted, the `LogicManager` updates the in-app `InventoryList` via the
`ModelManager` and saves to the data file via the `StorageManager`.

==== Edit Item Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Edit command feature of the Inventory Tab, which allows you to edit
items in the inventory. This feature requires the command keyword, an index and at least one field as input.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the
`EditCommand` works:

.Sequence Diagram of the Edit command in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/EditCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

==== Sort Items Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Sort command feature of the Inventory Tab, which allows the sorting
of items within the inventory. There are 3 ways items can be sorted - by description, category or quantity.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the
`SortCommand` works:

.Sequence Diagram of the Sort command in the Inventory tab (inventory package)
image::inventoryDG/SortCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

==== Overall Design Considerations

This section explains the design considerations for some crucial implementations in the Inventory Tab.

|===
|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 |Conclusion and Explanation

| `ModelManager` could contain a separate `InventoryList` that stores the original list in order to restore the original
order when [blue]`sort reset` is called.

*Pros*: It is relatively fast.

*Cons*: It takes up a lot of memory.

| Each `Item` could store a copy of the original ID as a private attribute. When [blue]`sort reset` is called, the list
is sorted by the original ID.

*Pros*: Keeping one list is better for memory complexity.

*Cons*: Sorting could be slightly slow.

| Alternative 2 has been chosen. The time complexity of sorting is not very high, but it has a much higher advantage in
memory complexity.

| An ArrayList is used to store `Item` objects in the `InventoryList`.

*Pros*: It retrieves most elements more efficiently.

*Cons*: The head and tail are not retrieved as efficiently.

| A LinkedList is used to store `Item` objects in the `InventoryList`.

*Pros*: The head and tail of the list can be retrieved via linear time complexity.

*Cons*: Every other element would be slower to retrieve.
|
Alternative 1 has been implemented. An ArrayList has better performance for the get and set methods than a LinkedList
for elements not in the head and tail.
As it is natural for the number of items in the inventory to be high, and the get and set methods would naturally be
frequently used in the `ModelManager`, the ArrayList seems to be a better choice.
|
|===

=== Cashier Tab

This tab will act as a shopping cart to add and record sales items that are to be sold from the inventory.

Upon every successful checkout, all the sales items sold will recorded as one transaction, which will subsequently be appended to the list of transactions on the Home tab.
In addition, the stock remaining in the inventory will be updated accordingly in the Inventory tab.

==== Add Sales Item Feature

This feature allows the addition of sales items to the cart.

Only sales items can be added to the cart.
If the price of an item is zero, it is not available for sale.
The system will prohibit any addition of such an item to the cart.

Adding of a sales item to the cart will require an input of its description and quantity.
An optional field for category is provided to guide the cashier to find the desired item.
If only the category field is inputted,
`Model` will search all the sales items in the `Inventory List`
according to the specified category and suggestions would be shown by Leo, the assistant.

If the description inputted does not match any valid item, the `Model` will call the `getRecommendedItems(description)` method, which will in turn call `getCombination(arr, arr.length)` method to return an ArrayList containing all subsets of the inputted description that are of at least length 3. These subsets are then compared with the actual description of all items in the inventory to check if either contains the other.

The following is a code snippet from `getCombination(char[] arr, int n)` method:

    public ArrayList<String> getCombination(char[] arr, int n) {
        ArrayList<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int start = 1; start <= n; start++) {
            String word = "";
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - start; i++) {
                //  Adds characters from current starting character to current ending character
                int j = i + start - 1;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                    word += String.valueOf(arr[k]);
                }
                result.add(word);
            }
        }
        return result.stream()
                .filter(str -> str.length() >= 3)
                .collect(Collectors
                        .toCollection(ArrayList::new));
    }

.Code snippet of `getCombination(char[] arr, int n)` method from Cashier package

{blank} +
The `getCombination(arr, arr.length)` method in the above snippet consists of 3 nested loops. The first loop decides the
starting character. The second loop takes each of the characters on the right of the starting character as the ending character.
The last loop appends all the characters from the starting character to the ending character. After iterating through the nested loops,
the ArrayList `result` is passed into a stream to filter out all subsets of length less than 3.

`AddCommandParser` will carry out multiple checks to check the validity of the inputs. `hasItemInInventory(description)`
and `hasSufficientQuantityToAdd(description, quantity)` methods will be called to ensure the item has sufficient stock left in the inventory. +
There will also be checks to ensure that the item specified is available for sale.

If description and quantity are both valid, the `ModelManager` will add the item into the sales list as shown in Figure 2.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the `AddCommand` works:


.Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Cashier tab (cashier package)
image::AddCommandCashierSeq.png[]

[NOTE]
After every `Add Command`, the quantity of items in the Inventory tab will still remain the same. The remaining stock
will only be updated after the checkout command.


[NOTE]
Once the item is added, boolean `onCashierMode` in ModelManager will be immediately set to true if it is initially false.

The following activity diagram shows the steps proceeding after the user input an Add command:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command (cashier package)
image::AddCommandCashierActivity.png[]

==== Setting the Cashier Feature

This feature allows an existing person in the `Address Book` to be set as a cashier.
The only field required is the name of an existing person.

To set a cashier, the person's name inputted has to match an existing name in the `AddressBook` as shown on Members tab.
This means that SetCommandParser requires access to the `Model` of the Person package where the `AddressBook` implementation is. +
If the person's name cannot be found in the `Model` of the Person package, a response message will be shown by Leo, informing the user that there is no such person.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the SetCashierCommandParser checks for an existing person:

.Sequence Diagram of SetCashierCommandParser (cashier package)
image::SetCashierCommandSeq1.png[]

If the specified name is valid, the `Model` of the cashier package will set the person as cashier.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the set cashier command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Set Cashier Command (cashier package)
image::SetCashierCommandSeq2.png[]

If the inputted name is invalid, the user will be prompted to enter a valid name.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a set cashier command:

.Activity Diagram of Set Cashier Command (cashier package)
image::SetCashierCommandActivity.png[]

==== Checkout Feature

This feature records all the sales items in the table as one sales transaction under the `Sales` category.

The Home tab will be updated with the new transaction labelled as `Items sold`.
The remaining stock of the sales items will also be updated on the Inventory tab.

During the execution of the command, `getCashier()` method will be called which will return a person.
This person will be used to create a `Transaction` object.
If the cashier is null, the command cannot proceed and Leo will prompt the user to set a cashier. +
If the amount inputted is valid and cashier has been set, the `ModelManager` will create a new transaction of the sales made.

[NOTE]
After the execution of the above methods, a clear command will then be called automatically to clear all the sales items on the tab.

[NOTE]
After checkout command is executed, boolean `onCashierMode` in ModelManager will be immediately set to false.

The following Sequence Diagram which is referenced in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>, shows how the checkout command is executed:

.Sequence Diagram of Checkout Command (cashier package)
image::CheckoutCommandCashierSeq1.png[]

The `Cashier Logic` will call relevant methods to update the inventory list and newly-generated transaction to the respective `.txt file`. +
To update the view on the Inventory tab and Transaction tab, transaction will be added to the transaction `Model` and
`readInUpdatedList()` method of inventory `Model` will called to read in the entire inventory data file.

The following Sequence Diagram shows how the transaction and inventory are updated:

.Sequence Diagram of how Transaction and Inventory get Updated (cashier package)
image::CheckoutCommandCashierSeq2.png[]

If the amount inputted is less than the total amount of items, the user will be prompted to key in a valid value.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a checkout command:

==== Overall Design Considerations

This section explains the design considerations for some crucial implementations in the Cashier tab.

|===
|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 |Conclusion and Explanation

|An ArrayList is used to store the list of sales item shown on the Cashier tab.

*Pros*: Elements are be accessed directly more efficiently.

*Cons*: Adding and removing from the head of the list is less time-efficient for ArrayList.

|A LinkedList is used to store the list of sales item.

*Pros*: Elements can be accessed from the head and tail of the list in constant time.

*Cons*: When accessing directly via the index, performance is poor with respect to time.

|Alternative 1 is selected. An ArrayList has better performance with respect to time when accessing each elements directly. As the sales list will be updated and accessed regularly, an ArrayList is more fitting.

|The Transaction, Inventory and Person `Model` interfaces are passed as parameters into the constructor of Cashier's `Logic`
to call relevant methods to update the inventory and transactions.

*Pros*: Cashier's Logic can access all public methods in the respective `Model`.

*Cons*: It might result in unintended modification to some of the data in the Models.

|Interfaces that only contains the required methods are created. The methods are called via these interfaces
to update the data.

*Pros*: Prevents any unwanted changes through other methods. This adheres to the Facade Pattern.

*Cons*: If more methods are needed, they need to be added to these interfaces.

|Alternative 2 was implemented as only a few methods are required from each `Model`, so the new interfaces can act as facades
and restrict access to all public methods in the models. This prevents Cashier’s `Logic` from causing any
unintended modification to any of the data in the Models.

|The Cashier's `Storage` directly writes to and from the data file of the inventory and transaction.

*Pros*: It can access the data file directly without any dependencies.

*Cons*: The data files can be modified from 2 sources, increasing chances of bugs.

|The Cashier's `Storage` accesses the methods from the Transaction and Inventory storage via their `Logic`
to update the data.

*Pros*: The data files are only modified from 1 source, ensuring cohesiveness in the format of data stored.

*Cons*: It introduces more dependencies on the storage of other packages.

|Alternative 2 is implemented to enforce defensive programming, so that the data files are not modified via 2 different
methods from different sources and eliminates any chances of uncoordinated data in the data files.

|===

=== Overview Tab

This tab displays various summary statistics for the data within treasurerPro.
There are four main statistics shown:

. Expense Summary: Pie chart of expenditure by category.
. Inventory Summary: Pie chart of inventory by category.
. Sales Summary: Bar chart of sales by months.
. Budget Overview: Line chart of budget remaining by months.

The above summaries are automatically updated whenever new data is entered from any of the other tabs.

There are two main user features within this tab: a feature allowing the user to set goals, and a feature for the user
to set percentage thresholds for notifications.

==== Set Command Feature

This feature allows the user to set a goal for their budget, expense or sales targets.

The following Sequence Diagram depicts how the Set Command operates, and is an extension of the general sequence diagram
found in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3. Logic component: Figure 5>>:

.Sequence Diagram of Set Command in the Overview package.
image::OverviewSetCommandSD.png[]

After execution of the command, the `LogicManager` also instructs the `StorageManager` to save the new information to
the data file.

==== Notify Command Feature

This feature allows the user to set a percentage threshold for notifications. Upon hitting that percentage for a
particular financial goal, the user will automatically be notified of it with a message from Leo.

The following Sequence Diagram depicts how the Notify Command operates, and is an extension of the general sequence
diagram found in <<GeneralLogicSD, 2.3 Logic component: Figure 5>>:

.Sequence Diagram of Notify Command in the Overview Package
image::OverviewNotifyCommandSD.png[]

After execution of the command, the `LogicManager` also instructs the `StorageManager` to save the new information to
the data file. The full execution of the command is shown in the activity diagram below:

.Activity Diagram of Notify Command in the Overview Package
image::OverviewNotifyActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

In order to display the summary statistics shown to the user within the Overview tab, they must first be calculated.
Several design considerations were made as to how these calculations would be made, as shown in the table below:

|===
|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 (Current Choice)|Conclusion and Explanation

|The summary statistics are calculated by retrieving the transaction and item lists. Each transaction or item is then
read individually and their totals added up.

*Pros*: This is a much simpler, straightforward implementation.

*Cons*: It is difficult to filter the list by a given criteria, which is required for certain summary statistics.

|The Java Streams library is used to calculate the summary statistics, by retrieving the transaction list and item list
as streams instead.

*Pros*: It is much easier to filter the list from a given criteria with the built in `.filter()` method, and additional
criteria can easily be added simply by adding additional `.filter()` methods.

*Cons*: Java Streams run slower than their iterative counterparts when the list is small, and are more complex to
implement.

|Alternative 2 is selected as the performance difference is negligible for smaller lists, and will benefit the user in
the long run as their lists of transactions and items become larger and larger.

Additionally, it allows for future extensibility of summary statistics, as new statistics can be created simply by
modifying or adding on new criteria.

|===

The following is a code snippet of the chosen implementation above:

    public double getTotalExpenses() {
        Stream<Transaction> transactionStream = transactionLogic.getTransactionList().stream();
        return transactionStream
            .filter(transaction -> !transaction.getCategory().equals("Sales"))
            .filter(transaction -> transaction.isNegative())
            .flatMapToDouble(transaction -> DoubleStream.of(transaction.getAmount()))
            .sum() * -1;
    }

A design consideration was also made for the implementation of the notifications that are to be displayed
to the user upon hitting the notification threshold. These are shown in the table below:

|===
|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 (Current Choice)|Conclusion and Explanation

|A new class is created to act as a notifier, and is called after the execution of every command to check if any
notifications need to be displayed to the user.

*Pros*: All tabs can utilize this notifications feature and display messages to the user when needed.

*Cons*: Extra program resources are needed to create such a class.

|A method within the Overview tab's `Logic` is called to check if any of the notifications thresholds have been met.

*Pros*: Easy to implement with minimal new resources required.

*Cons*: It will be difficult to extend this functionality to other tabs if needed.

|Alternative 2 was implemented after a discussion held with the team revealed that this functionality was and would not
be needed for any of the other tabs.

Thus, it made more sense to stick with the simpler, less resource intensive
implementation of this function,

|===

The following is a code snippet of the chosen implementation above:

    private void checkIfNotify() {
        List<OverallCommandResult> notifications = overviewLogic.checkNotifications();
        for (OverallCommandResult notif: notifications) {
            lion.setResponse(notif.getFeedbackToUser());
        }
    }

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedtreasurerPro`.
It extends each tab's `Model` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `tabStateList` and `tabStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations in each tab's `ModelManager`:

* `ModelManager#commit()` -- Saves the current tab's state in its history.
* `ModelManager#undo()` -- Restores the previous tab's state from its history.
* `ModelManager#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone tab's state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface of the tab as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
Each package's model will be initialized with their initial default state, and the
`tabStatePointer` of each package pointing to that state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes a command that modifies the application state.
The command calls `Model#commit()`. The state after executing the command is saved in the `tabStateList`, and the
`tabStatePointer` is shifted to that new state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

[NOTE]
Commands that do not modify the application state will not call `Model#commit()`, and thus no new state
will be created in `tabStateList`. The `tabStatePointer` will continue to point at the same state.

Step 3. The user executes `undo` to undo the last command.
The `undo` command calls `Model#undo`, which shifts the currentStatePointer to the previous state,
restoring it to that state.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `tabStatePointer` is already pointing to the first item in the list, an error will be returned to the
user and nothing will be done.

Step 4. The user executes `redo` to redo the last `undo` command.
The `redo` command calls `Model#redo`, which shifts the currentStatePointer to the next state,
restoring it to that state. In this case, it is identical to after Step 2.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

==== Design Considerations
In order to implement the undo/redo command, several alternatives in design were considered before
settling on the current implementation:

|===
|Alternative 1 (Current Choice)|Alternative 2|Conclusion and Explanation

|The state of the tab is saved after every command.

*Pros*: This is much easier to implement.

*Cons*: Extra memory is used to store each state after every command.

|Each command is capable of undoing/redoing itself.

*Pros*: Less memory is required.

*Cons*: The implementation of each command becomes more complex, as it must be able to correctly undo/redo itself.

|Alternative 2 is selected due to its ease of implementation. Most modern computers also have sufficient
memory space to store extra states.
|===

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
