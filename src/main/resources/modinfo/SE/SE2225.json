    "description": "From the betel popular across the region for millenia, to colonial opium regimes, to Bangkok\u2019s Soi Cowboy, vice has always been a part of life in Southeast Asia. In this module, students investigate the economic, political, social, ecological, and cultural significance of a variety of substances and activities, from drugs like opium, alcohol and caffeine, to activities like paid sex and gambling. Students use a range of texts, including scholarly articles, memoirs, movies, and first\u2010hand observation to investigate the ways illicit substances and behaviors are deeply imbricated in everyday life in Southeast Asia.",
