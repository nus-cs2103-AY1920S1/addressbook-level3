== Introduction

*VISIT* is a *desktop address book application* for Doctors to *plan their visits* and *manage their patient information*. Most notably, VISIT is *optimized for Doctors who prefer to use a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having a pleasant Graphical User Interface (GUI). If your typing speed is sufficiently quick, VISIT can *greatly increase your efficiency* in managing your patient profiles and appointments. Interested in spending less time resolving logistical hiccups and more time doing your job? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `VISITapp.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for VISIT.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all patients
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to VISIT's address book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list

* Items in square brackets are *optional*. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/cough` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used optionally or multiple times. +

=== *Upcoming Features*
The following features are intended for a later release of VISIT that will further expand on the managing power doctors will be able to execute using the application.

==== Inventory System `[Coming in v2.0]`

VISIT v2.0 will include an inventory system for doctors to manage and organise their medical stores.
Doctors will be able to generate the list of medication in their stock and assign them to patients using the app
, which automatically deducts from that list. +
Warnings of low stocks are also an intended feature.

==== Printing of Medical Certificates `[Coming in v2.0]`

In v2.0, VISIT will allow doctors to easily print an official Medical Certificate with a single command.

==== Microsoft Azure Integration `[Coming in v2.0]`

Microsoft Azure is a popular Cloud Computing platform that allows for data analysis, remote deployment and user
authentication resources. We plan to leverage this power in VISIT v2.0 so that doctors may securely access
VISIT from any location, truly bringing VISIT on-the-go.
