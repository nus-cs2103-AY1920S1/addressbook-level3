    "description": "Businesses create value by supplying products or services to satisfy customer demand. Mismatches between the available supply and demand leads to severe economic consequences due to either unsatisfied customers or wasted resources. This is further complicated when stakeholders with conflicting incentives interact to bring products or services to market. In this course, we will investigate how firms can leverage their Value Chains, Logistics and Operations to limit both the incidence and consequence of supply-demand mismatches. Using cases from a wide range of industries, we will illustrate that firms that employ these techniques to better match supply with demand enjoy a significant competitive advantage and deliver superior value.",
