    "description": "Upon successful completion of the module, the student shall be able to: 1) understand and describe the major principles and types of rheology; and 2) how these can be applied to give the required structure, texture and viscosity in a processed biomaterials. Major topics covered include viscosity of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, viscoelastic properties of weak and strong gels, transient responses of a wide range of food and pharmaceutical products, and theoretical/empirical modelling of mechanical properties.",
