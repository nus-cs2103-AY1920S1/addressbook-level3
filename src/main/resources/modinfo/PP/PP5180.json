    "description": "The course links trade policy to global value chains (GVCs), which are the driving forces of 21st-century international trade. The first part addresses specific issues in trade policy, such as trade in goods and services, foreign direct investment, intellectual property rights, trade and standards, free trade agreements (FTAs), and the WTO. The second part focuses on GVCs. First it covers GVCs from economic and business perspectives, and examines how they work sectorally and geographically. Then it links GVCs to trade policy \u2013 at the national and sub-national levels, and how GVCs are covered in FTAs and the WTO.",
