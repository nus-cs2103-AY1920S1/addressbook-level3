== About the project
My team and I were tasked with enhancing a command line interface addressbook application. After careful consideration, we morphed the application into a Hackathon personnel management system called Alfred. With human resource managers of startups and small- and medium- sized enterprise in mind, we created this application to help streamline the management of Hackathon competitions. This improved application enables users to manage different parties(like participants, teams and mentors). Additionally, it automatically establishes relationships between these parties, delegating the tedious task of maintaining complex relationships to the system itself.

This is what our project looks like:

My main role was to design and write the code for the Graphical User Interface(GUI), in order to ensure that user experience is enhanced, and information is displayed in an organised and readable manner. As part of my duty, I have implemented the command suggestion prompt. I have also implemented `assign` and `remove` commands to assign participants or mentors to a team. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in further detail, including the relevant documentation I have included in the user and developer guide with reference to these features. Further details on the `home` command feature and layout of the GUI (that I have also implemented) can be found in the user guide and developer guide.

`remove mentor`     Text in red indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the
application.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other contributions to the project._
|===

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to choose from different suggested command templates as a user types into the user input box

* What it does: This feature predicts the command that a user is going to enter as they are typing, and provides suggestions. The user can then navigate and choose from these suggestions. Doing so will provide a command template for the user to work with.
* Justification: Managing different entities in the system requires a variety of commands(in which some are more complex in nature). Thus, this feature allows users to conveniently summon commands. Furthermore, it takes the memory work of remembering numerous commands out of the equation.
* Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. Addition of new commands would only require minimal changes to the code base of this feature. The fulfilment of this feature was more demanding as it requires a deeper understanding on the workings of the third party library JavaFX. On top of that, the implementation of this feature was constantly met with errors, before vital concepts regarding the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/Node.html[`Node`] component of JavaFX came into light.
* Credits: This was inspired by the command suggestion box in Telegram bots. The inspiration of how this feature can be implemented comes from the following webpage: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50495430/how-to-customize-auto-complete-text-field-suggestion-in-javafx

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to assign several participants or one mentor to a team

* What it does: The assign command assigns a participant or mentor to a team. The remove participant or remove mentor command removes said entity from the team.
* Justification: Hackathons involves teaming participants up and allocating a mentor to guide teams. This feature helps to establish this relation.

== Design Considerations
|===
|When designing the GUI, homepage statistics, command suggestion and assign/remove functions, careful deliberation was needed on optimum data structure to use and design principle to employ to implement these features. Below is a brief summary of the thought process I put in before coming to a decision.

[width="100%", cols="22%, 38%,40%"]
|=======================================================================
|Aspect |Alternative 1 |Alternative 2
|How to store a set of correct commands and search through it as user types: In order to provide suggestions as a user types, there needs to be a way to store the set of correct commands as strings in the system, and search through it to check if it contains some parts of user input. The results will be provided to the user as suggestions.
| Use an `ArrayList` and go through every element in the array list one by one to look for commands that matches the user input.

*Pros*: Easy to implement

*Pros*: When new commands are implemented, they can easily be added into the `ArrayList`

*Cons*: Allows duplicates, if duplicate commands are added into the `ArrayList`, duplicate suggestions may be provided.

*Cons*: Searching through the `ArrayList` is inefficient as `Stream` is not used.

|Store the commands in a `Set` and convert it to a `Stream` to search through the commands.

*Pros*: Prevent duplicates, so that duplicate commands will not be entered accidentally.

*Pros*: More efficient.

*Pros*: Easier to search through the set of commands when it is stored as `Stream`.

I have decided to proceed with this option as preventing duplicates enables a more defensive style of programming. It is also more efficient.

|How to fill up user input text field when a command suggestion is chosen:

upon choosing a command suggestion, it template(the command suggestion excluding blue-colored instructions and grey-colored guides) will be used to occupy the user input text field.

| Map each command suggestion to their respective templates in `String` form

*Pros*: Easy to implement.

*Cons*: Tedious to implement(requires many lines of code).

*Cons*: Duplicate logic will be implemented, as the templates could be extracted from the command suggestion itself.

| Filter out the relevant text template from the command suggestion that is choosen.

*Pros*: No duplicate logic is implemented as the templates are extracted directly from the choosen command suggestion.

*Pros*: Lesser code needs to be written in order to extract the template from the choosen command suggestion.

*Pros*: Use of regular expression may be harder to implement.
