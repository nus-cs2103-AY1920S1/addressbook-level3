    "description": "War crimes trials are commonly used to address mass violence and facilitate political transition. This course examines the potential and limits of war crimes trials as transitional mechanisms, comparing them with non-legal complements and alternatives. What transitional objectives do these trials seek to achieve and how do these trials contribute to a society\u2019s political transition? Given the many pressing and conflicting needs of post-war societies or societies in transition, should the organisation of such trials be prioritised? What are possible alternative transitional measures? What role should the law play, if at all? Using Singapore\u2019s Second World War experience as a central case study, this module will explore the challenges faced by societies undergoing political transition and the different legal and non-legal measures adopted.",
