    "description": "Cognitive neuropsychologists analyze case-study data from brain-injured children and adults in order to develop and evaluate models of normal cognitive processes. This module provides an opportunity for students with core knowledge in cognitive psychology, to examine how patterns of impaired performance have informed models of bilingualism, speaking, listening, reading, writing, object recognition, face perception, memory and attention. Wherever possible, video-tapes of patients with these deficits will be used to supplement the main textbook and journal articles. The ensuing discussion will hold implications for rehabilitation, but the emphasis will be on theoretical and methodological issues in the field.",
