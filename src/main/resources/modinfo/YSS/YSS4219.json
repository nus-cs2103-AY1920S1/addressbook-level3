The course considers the reasons for the failure of the peace process, from an international law perspective. It looks at the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, and the way the dispute has been shaped by outside actors and events. Beginning in the period of European colonialism, the course takes students through the Cold War and its aftermath to the Oslo years, the \u2018war on terror\u2019, and the unrest in the region after the uprisings in 2011.",
