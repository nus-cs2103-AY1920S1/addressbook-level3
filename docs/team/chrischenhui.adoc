== image:address_book_32.png[icon, 39, 36] Overview of _Dukemon_
//== Overview of _Dukemon_

._Dukemon_'s design.
image::DukemonWithMewOnly.png[width="400"]

_Dukemon_ is a desktop flashcard application, which aims to streamline and gamify
the process of learning words and definitions. +
The user interacts with it primarily through a CLI (Command Line Interface), with some GUI (Graphical User Interface) features.

Allow me to brief you on some useful terms and to give you a context.

1. Flashcards are termed as `Cards`. +
2. A collective set of `Cards` are termed as `WordBank`.

3. A general flow of _Dukemon_'s usage is as follows:

.. Note taking phase

... User creates/selects a `WordBank`.
... User populates the `WordBank` with `Cards`, or edit the `Cards`.

.. Learning phase

... User starts the game using selected `WordBank`.
... _Dukemon_ prompts the questions, and user has to answer accordingly.
... _Dukemon_ ends the game.
... User reviews performance from statistics page.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major feature
*_WordBank_ Management*

* *What it does:* +
** Enables user to have a high level management for his _WordBanks_ and _Cards_ through CLI and GUI. +
Is semi-automated by _Dukemon_ to enhance user's learning experience. +
Consists of four complementary distinct sections.

. *_WordBank_'s data structure and its storage system*: +
Allows developers to use and extend this architecture to streamline their feature implementation. +
Allows user to save and load their _WordBanks_. +
Is implemented with a robust underlying `WordBankList` data structure, with its
own `WordBankListStorage`,
along with rich integration of `Model`, `Storage`, `Logic` and `UI` to synchronise its
data.

. *User Commands*: +
Allows user to customise _Cards_ / _WordBanks_ through `CardCommands` / `WordBankCommands`.

. *Drag and drop*: +
Allows user to export their _WordBanks_ out of their computer simply by dragging it out of _Dukemon_. +
Likewise, it allows user to import a _WordBank_ file from their computer by dragging it into _Dukemon_.

. *Revision _WordBank_*: +
Allows user to visit a centralised word bank that automatically collects cards for revision. +
Cards that were answered wrongly are automatically added to this revision bank. +
Likewise, cards that were answered correctly during game play are automatically removed from this revision bank.

//{nbsp}

* *Justification:*

** Well designed architecture and well implemented data structure streamlines integration and allows extension for
features that builds on top of it. (_Statistics, Game, Settings_)

** Management system is essential for a self-typed flashcard app like _Dukemon_.

** Drag and drop accelerates the sharing of knowledge/notes with friends, thereby enhancing user experience. +

** Revision _WordBank_ improves the learning process by helping the user collate cards that requires revision.

//{nbsp}

* *Highlights:*

** There exists multiple ways to design and implement _WordBank_ management. Throughout _Dukemon_'s development,
it has been restructured and rewritten a few times before finally coming to how it is implemented now. +
This was primarily because my teammate's features requires heavy and continuous integration with _WordBank's_ management. We came together twice every week to discuss how our features should be integrated with one another. +
To best implement it, I spent considerable amount of effort to study different design patterns and architectural styles, such as _MVC (Model View Controller)_,
_Observer Pattern_, _n-Tier Style_, _Event-Driven Style_, to realise the final design.

** Continual in-depth discussion with team member, Subbash, to find the best design to integrate user commands
with his different modes.

** Discussed with team member, Paul, who is in-charge of UI, on _Observer Pattern_ usage to display _Cards_ and _WordBanks_ that automatically
update itself.

** Consulted team member, Jason, on how I can best leverage his _Statistics_ feature to streamline my revision bank implementation.

** Learned and adapted _Callbacks_ and _Functional Programming_ into my drag and drop section
to preserve the quality and structural integrity of the existing code base, from team member Yi Da.

** Individually sourced for proper online tutorials and online code references to implement drag and drop section,
and design concepts such as _Observer Pattern_ and _MVC_ within _Cards_ and _WordBanks_.

** Teammates
*** For their continual discussion, presence and support as mentioned in my highlights above.
** Tutors
*** For their unconditional effort in guiding us and providing us with valuable resources and feedback throughout _Dukemon_'s development.

=== Minor features
** Default WordBanks for new players
*** Implemented multiple user friendly word banks for user to try out. (pokemon, arithmetic, trivia, graph, cs2103t)
*** Created on the first launch of _Dukemon_ (implemented through preferences file), and behaves like normal word bank. (Can be edited and removed)
*** Implemented the initialisation of required folders for related files automatically if not present.

** User experience centric messages
*** Played the game insane amount of times to design constructive feedback to display on the command box from the user perspective.
*** Developed user friendly command usage feedback that guides the user to using _Dukemon_.
