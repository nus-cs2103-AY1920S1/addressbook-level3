    "description": "This course will focus on several things. First, each actor will learn how to build their acting craft, and will achieve personal confidence in a way of working. Second, each actor will work on two or three scenes with a partner. These scenes will be chosen from World literature, and any time frame, depending on the student actor\u2019s needs. Third, we will cre-ate an original piece of theatre as the culmination of the course. This module fulfills the Art Practice track in the Arts & Humanities major.",
