== Introduction

StudyBuddy Level 1 is for students in the School of Computing at NUS
that prefer to use a desktop app to help their studies.
StudyBuddy is also optimized for those who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). Being highly familiar working with CLI,
Computing Students can greatly benefit from the app to
manage their studies efficiently and faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Command Format / Rules

Things noted here are standardization of the User Guide.
These points are absolute, unless stated otherwise in the specific section(s).

****
* All commands are written in ENGLISH with no weird symbols.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
E.g. `add <t/TITLE>` -> `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Midterm notes`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
E.g `t/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `t/Midterm note t/exam` or as `t/Midterm`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`

* All flashcards, notes, cheatsheets objects will be given a unique `id` on creation.

* All flashcards, notes, cheatsheets objects can have a maximum of 5 `TAG` each.

* All `MODULE` parameters are a `TAG`.

* In EDITING (`edit`):
    ** All optional fields provided, except `t/TAG`, will overwrite their relevant fields.
    ** `t/TAG` optional field, will be added to the flashcard, if they do not already exist.

* In DELETING (`delete`), Confirmation reply of `y` or `n` has to be given, else no objects is deleted.
    ** `y` indicates `YES` and notes will be deleted.
    ** `n` indicates `NO` and notes will not be deleted.

* Any indexes (`id`) must be positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...).
The indexes refers to the index number shown in the displayed list of objects (e.g. flashcards, notes, cheatsheets, tags).

* Only exact matches of any searches will be returned.
E.g. "noted" will return "noted" but not "note" or "notes"

* All searches are case insensitive.
E.g. 'cs2103t' will match 'CS2103T'
