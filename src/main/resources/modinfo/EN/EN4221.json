    "description": "This module uses major dramatic texts to examine the topic of performance in Elizabethan/Jacobean literature and culture, both of which are marked by a pervasive theatricalization of authority, social categories, and personal identity. Significantly, the culture was also shaped by a theology that identified performance with evil. The module aims to provide students with an understanding of the culture of the period as well as a survey of its drama. The module is designed for advanced undergraduate English majors, preferably those who have taken at least one other module in English literature before 1700.",
