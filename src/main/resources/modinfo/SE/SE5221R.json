    "description": "This module will provide an overview of the diversity of peoples and places in Southeast Asia, with the aim of examining its regional identity. It is grounded conceptually in the notion of 'landscape', situated across multiple scales of reality from the local to the global. Empirically, aspects of material and non-material cultures and dimensions of Southeast Asia will be discussed, including the economy, religion, environment and politics. The potential and limits of 'landscape geography' in critically understanding Southeast Asia will also be assessed.",
