    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for the BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, winds and percussion. For BMus instrumentalists, this is the first performance which is assessed formally as a contribution to the overall graduation requirement. The module functions effectively as the audition requirement for transfer for the Young Artists to the BMus programme and for those NUS students seeking to move into a second major focus in the instrument.",
