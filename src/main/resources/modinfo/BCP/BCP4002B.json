    "description": "The job scope of the Consulting Practicum is part of the initial negotiations between the students and the company. Through this, the students learn how to define a job scope, negotiate the resources, and negotiate the timeline and deliverables. The instructor is only involved in confirming the final agreement between the students and the company. It is an interactive process as the students have to make a preliminary survey of the company before finalising the job scope. The project is divided into stages -- planning, research and assessment, and recommendations. It is not the same as an industrial attachment as the students take a strategic approach to dealing with a real company issue - it is a consulting project, pure and simple. It is not an academic exercise as the research is focused on real work issues. Students use their skills learnt in library work and market research.",
