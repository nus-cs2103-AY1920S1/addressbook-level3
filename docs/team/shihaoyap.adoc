== Welcome to AddMin+

== Overview on Project

AddMin+ is a student developed application under the National University of Singapore's __CS2103T Software Engineering Module__.
The project required students to enhance a basic command-line interface desktop application which is the
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3]
that was developed by the se-edu team. The
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3]
is a desktop address book application that was designed to be used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

== About AddMin+

The AddMin+ Team comprises of 5 Computer science students from AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3. The team decided to
morph and enhance the capabilities of the original application into an all-in-one administration desktop
application. The application is specially designed for the use of any events management start-up company
that is faced with limited manpower and resources.

AddMin+ is specially designed to ease the workload of admin staff in these companies and allow them to
effectively handle the administrative needs of the company by providing the following functions: event creation and
deletion, editing of event details, manual and automatic manpower allocation for events and providing an
overview of all the data via statistics while keeping track of the companies schedule to ensure that no event
will be missed!

To give you a better picture of AddMin+! This is what the application looks like:

== My Roles and Responsibilities
My project responsibilities and tasking include being in charge of the group's documentation quality as
well as ensure that high standards are maintained and delivered on time and in the right format.

While my coding related tasking was to design and write codes for the entire *Schedule* section of the project.
The following sections will illustrate the enhancements in more detail, as well as provide relevant
documentation that I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to those enhancements.

== Before we start
The following symbols and formatting will be used throughout this document:

[TIP]
*LightBulbs* indicate a _Tip_, something that is helpful to the reader

[NOTE]
*'i' Icon* indicate a _Note_ that supplements useful information

Text in a link:[`blue font and grey`] background indicates a _hyperlink_

Texts with a `grey background` indicates _Code Logic_ such as class objects, OOP definitions or user-input.


== Summary of contributions
This section will show a summary of all the features, enhancements, documentation, and other useful contributions
that I have contributed to the team project.

* *Major feature*: added and implemented the entire *Schedule* section of the project which includes major GUI implementations
and 4 schedule related commands.

** What does it do: The *Schedule* section was implemented to allow users to have an easier way to view and identify
events that are happening on a specific date or period. Thus, the `display_schedule_date`, `display_schedule_month`
and `display_schedule_between` commands were implemented. The enhancement was also done to improve the user experience, by providing a clean
graphical representation of the user's schedule through the use of the `generate_schedule` command, greatly improving the application's user experience.

** Justification: The *Schedule* feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to have a convenient way to view their
upcoming event schedule and keep track of all the important event dates. The feature will greatly improve the user experience of the application
by providing a clean user interface to allow the users to have a visual overview of their schedules.

** Highlights: This enhancement requires handling and dealing with the `Event` objects extensively. The implementation of the *Schedule* feature
required an in-depth analysis of the application's storage and modeling architecture. The *Schedule* feature was also challenging as
it required the implementation of an additional `DistinctDate` object for the `generate_schedule` command which was also used in the
`Employee` window. During the designing of the *Schedule* component, deep consideration was needed to ensure that the user interface was clean
and optimal for the users.

* *Minor features*: Multiple Graphic User Interface improvements were made throughout the application to improve the user experience.
Implemented the tab recognition feature, which is used to restrict commands on specific tabs to prevent unusual behavior, which can cause users to be confused.
Other minor features includes the implementation of the `add_ev`, `edit_ev`, `find_em_tag` and `find_ev_tag` commands
for the AddMin+ App.

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|_The original user guide has been updated to document the new capabilities of the AddMin+ functionality.
The following are excerpts from the AddMin+ User Guide, which will showcase the sections that I have contributed to, in
particular, the *Schedule* section of the UG. They will showcase my ability to write documentation for end-users._
|===

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=Schedule1]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. The section will cover the design considerations and
design code structure of the `generate_schedule` command. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation
and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._

== Conclusion:
The AddMin+ project was created by the AddMin+ Team as part of a university module requirement. Through AddMin+, I was able
to experience what it was like to be involved in a software development project, where we were able to experience both the technical and
non-technical aspects of a software development project. We were able to directly apply the key software development concepts taught in CS2103T
in our project and also experience what it was like dealing with a brown-field project.

Another aspect of software development which I felt is often overlooked is actually the non-technical aspect, such as
documentation writing. However, through CS2101, we were able to learn the steps of writing quality documentation of our project
that caters to our target audiences. Finally, even though the AddMin+ project was only 6 weeks long, I was able to pick up many valuable knowledge
that will be essential in becoming a software developer in the future. If you would like to know more about me or AddMin+, feel free to drop by my https://shihaoyap.github.io/ShihaoResume/index.html[personal website] or
