    "description": "This advanced seminar explores the international politics of Southeast Asia using new and innovative theories from International Relations (IR). Southeast Asia is at the crossroads of a range of contemporary dynamics: from US-China power-shifts, and South China Sea disputes, to democratic transitions (Burma) and populist authoritarian rollbacks (Philippines). The scholarly study of Southeast Asian IR has not kept pace with the region, however. This module draws on IR practice theory, international political sociology, feminist theory, emotions theory, and diplomatic history to examine how colonialism, class, ethnicity, gender, emotions, domestic politics, regime types (democracy/authoritarianisms) etc., shape Southeast Asian IR.",
