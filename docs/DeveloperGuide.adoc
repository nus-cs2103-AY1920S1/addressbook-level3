== Introduction

=== What is Powerlifting Competition Coordinator?

Powerlifting Competition Coordinator is a free application for powerlifting competition event organizers
that is simple, fast, and easy to use. It is targeted at organizers of small to medium sized powerlifting
competitions who require a hassle-free way of managing and tracking the lifts of participants in and out
of the powerlifting competitions. During competition mode, the system has real time maintenance of athlete
rankings within their respective weight classes allowing the organizer track the participants'
standings at all times throughout the duration of the competition.

=== Core team

Powerlifting Competition Coordinator  was developed and is maintained by
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-3[Team T11-3].
Feel free to https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-3/main/issues[contact us] for any enquries.

=== Contributing

Powerlifting Competition Coordinator is an open source project and we would love to involve any contributor
who has a passion for powerlifting.
To get involved, start by reading <<SettingUp#, Section 2, “Setting up”>>.

== Setting up

This section includes the instructions to set up your development environment.

=== Prerequisites

Prior to setting up the project proper, make sure you have the following.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 11 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 11. +
You can get the latest Java 1 JDK at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads[this link].
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

To setup the project in IntelliJ, follow the steps below.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

To verify that the setup is completed successfully, you should:

. Run the `seedu.system.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing, Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

This subsection includes configurations that you may find necessary or useful as you work on this project.
We recommend that you make these configuration changes and additions before you start writing code.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. Follow the instructions below to rectify this.

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level3` repo.
If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the
`se-edu/addressbook-level3`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section documents the design and interaction of components in Powerlifting Competition Coordinator.
Please take a moment to understand the different components before making any code changes.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a
quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
 `CompetitionListPanel`, `ParticipationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SystemParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the System data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<Competition>` and `ObservableList<Participation>`
that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the
data in the list change.
* exposes a Session class to handle the context switching between in and out of competition sessions.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `Person`, `Competition`, `Participation` data in json format and read it back.


== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Context-Switching feature between sessions

==== Overview

Our features are mainly split into 2 contexts. An in-competition, and an out-of-competition session mode.
A session is started when the user wants to start an existing competition to call lifters to perform their attempt,
record them, and finally to view the ranking leader board for the competition, all within in-session mode.
On the other hand, an out-session mode, when the user exits the competition session mode,
is where all create, read, update delete of the Person, Competition, and Participation is done.

The reason for this context-switching feature is to prevent users from using out-session commands that are strictly for
in-session mode and vice versa.

.Activity Diagram for average user flow from out to in-session.
image::ActivityDiagram.png[]

Figure 9 shows the average user flow of how the user can go in-session,
and also distinctly shows the commands that can be done in each state.
However, the end of every competition session does not signify the end of a user's activity.
The user can still go in and out of the competition session (start and end), to perform the different commands
from the different states.


==== How it is being implemented

This is done using an instance of the Session class, which is exposed from the model manager.
The session has a competition field to indicate the current competition that is ongoing during the session.
If there is no competition set in the session, then there is no ongoing session. Using this simple
but highly effective method, we are able to use very simple logic to achieve the necessary context-switching behaviour
described in the above diagram.

=== In-Session
In-Session is the state where the user enters competition mode, where users can command the app to generate
the next lifter, as well as record any attempt. At the end of the competition, the rank of the participants
and competition can be viewed too, as long as a competition session has yet to end.

To handle the state of the competition, we have created a new `Session` class that is packaged into model and
managed by the ModelManager. The `Session` class is a singleton class, and only has one instance in the ModelManager.
The reason behind the use of a singleton class to handle sessions, is that we only want one ongoing session at any
point in time. The singleton class will also only temporarily store its participation list, and participationAttempt
list in relation to the ongoing session. Once the session ends, all data is reset.
Any update in any objects such as the attempts or participation details will be handled by the ModelManager,
which will be explained in more details in the respective features below.

.Class Diagram of the Session package in the Model
image::SessionClassDiagram.png[]


==== Next feature
One of the main purpose of the in-session function is to generate the next lifter and his attempt details accordingly.
In the `Session` class, the list of `ParticipationAttempt` is maintained so that athletes can make their attempt
in order of the type of lift, attempt number, and in increasing weight to be attempted. Upon calling the `next` command,
the next lifter is called up, and the following lifter should be asked to prepare for his lift, after the next lifter.

Format: `next`

Given below is the example flow of what the model does when the `NextLifterCommand` is executed after being parsed
through the LogicManager.

*Step 1:* A new `NextLifterCommand` is constructed when the user inputs `next` in the command box.
When `NextLifterCommand#execute()` is called, the model will get the following lifter, and store the
ParticipationAttempt retrieved from `Session#getFollowingLifter()` in a local variable,
to be returned together with the CommandResult later on.

*Step 2:* The `ModelManager` will call `Session#NextLifter()` to generate the next lifter and attempt in the form of a
`ParticipationAttempt` object. If the `Session` is not prepared, which means that the imported `ParticipationAttempts`
are not sorted, `prepare()` will be called internally. When this method is called, the ParticipationAttempt list in the
Session will be sorted according to the new `ParticipationAttemptComparator`. When this is done, the session is now
prepared, and next or following lifters can be generated based on this sorted list.
(This method is usually called once just after starting the session.)

*Step 3:* The `Session#NextLifter()` method will then return the first `ParticipationAttempt` in the list.
This is equivalent to the next lifter to make his attempt, since he is the top most in the sorted list.

*Step 4:* A new `CommandResult` will be returned. Details of the next and following ParticipationAttempt will be
included and displayed in the Dialogue Box to the user.

.Sequence Diagram for the NextLifterCommand
image::NextSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Lift feature
This command allows the user to update and record the result of the attempt that was just made.
The participation's dependent attempts as well as scores will be automatically updated according to the lifts made and
recording using this command.

Format: `lift Y/N`

Given below is the example flow of how the model executes the `AttemptLiftedCommand` in the model after it is
parsed through the `LogicManager`.

*Step 1:* An `AttemptLiftedCommand` is created with a boolean parameter to indicate the success of the lift.
An input `lift y` by the user will create an `AttemptLiftedCommand`, taking in boolean `true`.

*Step 2:* The following lifter and attempt is retrieved and stored in a local variable in the execute method of the
command, so that we can prompt the user of the following lifter, before any changes are made to the existing attempts.

*Step 3:* `model#makeAttempt()` is called in the execute method of the command. The `ModelManager` will then call
`Session#attemptMade()` to indicate the attempt has been made. This method will return a `ParticipationAttempt` object
that has just been made, and stored in a local variable named `next`. If this particular attempt has already been made,
an exception will be thrown to inform the user in the form of a `CommandResult`.

*Step 4:* The `Participation` of the `next` will be retrieved, so that we can update the participant's attempt by
calling `Participation#updateAttempt()`. `ModelManager#setParticipation()` will then update the participation's attempt
in the storage accordingly.

*Step 5:* `AttemptLiftedCommand#execute()` will then return a new `CommandResult` containing the associated result,
together with the following lifter.

.Sequence Diagram for the AttemptLiftedCommand
image::LiftSequenceDiagram.png[]

//tag::Rank[]
==== Rank feature
A RankCommand class is created to facilitate ranking of an athlete for a given competition he or she participates in.

===== Implementation
RankCommand extends the Command Abstract Class, the rationale is explained in `Choice of Design Pattern` sub-section of the Rank feature.

Rank feature has 2 sequential checks:
1. Checks if a competition session is ongoing, rank command can only be used if a competition session persists.
2. Checks if an athlete participates in a competition, rank command can only be used if an athlete participates in a competition.

Finally, the feature returns an athlete's report card for a competition. For example,

 Athlete: Alex Yeoh
 Competition: NUS Powerlifting Open 2019
 Rank: 1
 Total Score: 1
 Max Squat: 1
 Max Bench Press: 0
 Max Deadlift: 0

When the rank feature is used, RankCommand interacts with other classes to return an athlete's report card. See the
sequence diagram for a high level depiction of how RankCommand interacts with other classes.

.Sequence Diagram of the RankCommand
image::RankCommand.png[]

===== Choice of Design Pattern
Original AB3 code base uses a Command Design Pattern, which facilitates execution of different commands,
without the programme knowing which type of command is being executed. Furthermore, the original AB3 code base achieves
a Command Design Pattern by requiring different types of command classes to extend from a Command Abstract Class.

Due to time constraint and to achieve consistency with the Command Design Pattern of the original Code Base,
we decide to apply the Command Design Pattern for the Rank command too.

//end::Rank[]


==== Ranklist feature
A RanklistCommand class is created to facilitate ranking of all the participants for a given competition that is
currently ongoing (i.e. in-session). The ranking can be altered depending on the ranking method chosen by the user.
This provides the user a variety of ranking methods to suit the user's need during a powerlifting competition.
Typically, a powerlifting competition usually provides rankings for their participants based either on their overall
score or the maximum weight lifted for a particular lift.

===== Implementation
RankCommand extends the Command Abstract Class, the rationale is explained in `Choice of Design Pattern`
sub-section of the Ranklist feature.

Rank feature has 1 check:
1. Checks if a competition session is ongoing, Ranklist command can only be used if a competition session
is currently ongoing.

Finally, the feature returns a listing of the athletes based on the ranking method provided. For example,

 Ranking of athletes by overall score in competition NUS Powerlifting Open 2019:
1. Alex Yeoh (Score: 100)
2. Bernice Yu (Score: 97)
3. Charlotte Oliveiro (Score: 2)

When the Ranklist feature is used, RanklistCommand interacts with other classes to return a participant's score for
a given ranking method before sorting the list and displaying it on the screen as seen above. Please refer to the
sequence diagram for a high level depiction of how RanklistCommand interacts with other classes.

.Sequence Diagram of the RanklistCommand
image::RanklistCommand.png[]

===== Choice of Design Pattern
Original AB3 code base uses a Command Design Pattern, which facilitates execution of different commands,
without the programme knowing which type of command is being executed. Furthermore, the original AB3 code base achieves
a Command Design Pattern by requiring different types of command classes to extend from a Command Abstract Class.

Due to time constraint and to achieve consistency with the Command Design Pattern of the original Code Base,
we decide to apply the Command Design Pattern for the Ranklist command too.


==== End session feature
This feature ends the session, and shifts the user back to the out-session state.
All data stored in the session will be reset to default.

Format: `endSession`

When we first implemented the session feature, the session can only be ended when a competition has ended,
which means there are no more attempts to be made. However, we have now made it such that the user can switch
between sessions as and when, even in the middle of the competition. This gives users more flexibility to switch between
session states, without worrying about the state of the competition.

=== Out-Session

==== Start Session feature
The start session feature is a command to start a new competition session, when a user is not in competition state.
As mentioned in Section 4.2. above, `Session` allows the user to start any competition session as and when, even when a
competition has not ended (there are still attempts left to be made). To start a session, the user can enter
the command with the specified competition.

Format: `startSession c/COMPETITION_NAME`

Given below is the flow of execution in the model after a `StartSessionCommand#execute()` is called.

*Step 1:* `Model#startSession(comp, partList)` is called, where `comp` is the `Competition` object to start the session
with, and `partList` is the list of `Participation` who will be participating in this competition session.
The method then calls `Session#start(comp, partList)`.

*Step 2:* An internal call in the `start()` method, `loadAttempts(p, p.getAttempts())`, is made for every
`Participation` object, `p`, by looping through the `partList`, loading all unattempted attempts into the
participationAttemptList temporarily stored in the Session instance.
(`p.getAttempts()` retrieves the list of all 9 `Attempt` instance that the participation has submitted at the start.)

*Step 3:* The `loadAttempts()` method will loop through all the 9 `Attempt` objects taken in as parameter, and checks if
each has been attempted. If an `Attempt` by that `Participation` has not been attempted, a new `ParticipationAttempt`
object will be created and added to the list.

Because of the way `Session` handles the initialising of every new session, be it starting a new competition, resuming a
competition, or even starting a session with a competition that has already ended (all attempts have been made by the
athletes) is made possible.

.Sequence Diagram for the StartSessionCommand

//tag::Competition[]

==== Competition features
There are 4 competition/person features: adding, deleting, editing and listing competitions.
The features are briefly described below. The crux of adding and editing a competition commands is the CustomDate class
, the CustomDate class is important for validating the starting and ending dates for a competition event. The date
validation process will be discussed in detail in words and with the aid of class and sequence diagrams.

===== Adding a competition
To add a competition, a user supplies the name of a competition and its start and end dates. But, the start date must
be equal or before end date.

===== Deleting a competition
To delete a competition, a user supplies the index of that competition. The index of a competition will be displayed
in the user interface of that programme.

===== Editing a competition
A user has the choice of editing one or more of the following competition fields:the competition name, start and end dates
of a competition. But, similar to adding a competition, the edited start date must be equal or before the edited end date.

===== Listing a competition
To list all competitions stored in the programme.

===== Choice of Design Pattern
Similar to the Rank feature.

===== Implementation
As mentioned earlier, editing or adding competitions require start date to be equal or before the end date.
To ensure the dates given for a competition are valid, we created a CustomDate class.
Please see the following class diagram for more information on the association between CustomDate and Competition
classes.

.Class Diagram for the CustomDate and Competition classes
image::CustomDate.png[]

To see the mechanism of the date validation process, please see the following sequence diagram.

.Sequence Diagram of the addCompetition Command
image::addComp.png[]

Pros of CustomDate:

1. Note that DATE_FORMAT is hard-coded by us (class diagram cannot explicitly show this), this ensures our programme
maintains a consistent date format for all competitions.

2. By storing a Date object in the CustomDate class, we enable ParserUtil to call the before() method of the Date
class to check for valid dates. Please the sequence diagram for the addCompetitionCommand, which provides illustration
on how this is achieved.

Cons of CustomDate:

1. We need to ensure functions/classes which rely on CustomDate can catch and handle errors due to inappropriate
date properly. This means that any changes to CustomDate in the future requires some work to propagate the changes to
the rest of the code base.

2. Users may wish to have their own date format.

Alternative:

We have considered using only the Java Date object, but we think it will be neater to have a CustomDate class to
package a date object and its associated date format string in a CustomDate object. Furthermore, we can recycle the
functions available in the CustomDate class for person features too (read the next section).
//end::Competition[]

==== Person Features
There are 4 person features: adding, deleting, editing and listing persons. Similar to competition features, the
programme needs to validate date of birth when a user adds a person or edit a existing person's date of birth. In
particular, the programme needs to ensure a person added or edited will not have a date of birth which occurs in the
future. In other words, the person added or edited must have a date of birth equal to or before today's date.
For example, if today is the 11/10/2019, a person's date of birth must be prior to 11/10/2019 or it must be exactly
11/10/2019.

The features are briefly described below. Similar to the competition features, we will describe the association
between CustomDate and Person classes. Subsequently, we will describe the validation process for person features.

===== Adding a person
To add a person, supply a person's name, a date of birth and a gender (male or female only). A person must have
already been born. Example, if today os 11/09/2019, a user cannot add a person who is borned in 15/09/2019 (in the
future).

===== Deleting a person
To delete a person, supply the index of that person.

===== Editing a person
For person, a user has the choice of editing either the person name, date of birth or a gender.
But,  person must have already been born.

===== Listing people
To list all people stored in the programme.

===== Implementation
Similar to competition, the crux of editing or adding persons rely on the CustomDate class for date validation.

Please see the following class diagram for more information on the association between CustomDate and Person
classes.

.Class Diagram for the CustomDate and Person classes
image::CustomDatePerson.png[]

To see the mechanism of the date validation process, please see the following sequence diagram.

.Sequence Diagram of the addPerson Command
image::addPerson.png[]

Pros:

1. Note that DATE_FORMAT is hard-coded by us (similar to Competition features), this ensures our programme
maintains a consistent date format for all people.

2. By storing a Date object in the CustomDate class, we enable ParserUtil to call the before() method of the Date
class to check for valid dates.

Con:
Similar to the Competition section.

Alternative:
Alternative consideration is similar to the Competition section.

==== Participation features
A Participation is an association class we have created for every Person who has participation in a particular
Competition. A person can take part in many competitions, and for each competition he/she takes part in, there will be a
corresponding Participation class associated to that Person and Competition instance.

===== Supporting the create, read, update and delete of the instances of the Participation association class
To support the add, delete, and reading of the participation instances using the commands below,
the JSON storage system was modified (please refer to the Storage section above) in order to support
the many-to-many relationship between competition and person. This allows the association class to
be saved which the original Address Book architecture did not allow.

===== Choice of Design Pattern
Optimally, such many-to-many relationships should be handled by some form of join table on a database. Due to
the project restrictions, we mapped a similar structure the the JSON storage system treating each file as a table,
attempting to parallel the way real databases worked while still using JSON storage.

===== Implementation
To achieve this we treated each file saved as a table. Hence, there is a save file for each of the participation,
competition and person models. When reading from the JSON storage, the competition and person data are read first,
before the participation data is read. This is because the Competition and Person objects need to be created first
in order to be associated with the Participation class. Since the names of competitions and persons are unique,
we used that to identify the competition and person instances the participation instance that was originally
saved was associated with.

Pros:

1. By using a Json Storage, the amount of changes to the Storage system was substantial but minimized, while
still being able to support the Participation association class which helped decouple the Person and Competition
classes.

Con:

1. The uploading of the participation class from JSON relies on the property that there is some unique data
signature of a person and the competitions, which can be determined from the data stored as JSON. Since
both Person and Competition extend UniqueELementList, they will certainly be have some unique data
signature (i.e. in this case each person and competition have unique names), which can be used to determine the instances the
Participation object was originally associated with before it was saved. Hence, the current JSON storage
system is not designed extensibly for the developer to move away from using the UniqueElement class for its instances
or store data in a way that is not unique to the instances as instances with the same data signature cannot be
distinguished from each other using the current JSON storage system.


Alternative:

We have considered using XML storage and/or creating foreign keys using the JSON storage. However, due to the
limitations of time and the complexity of achieving such a feature, we settled with modifying the JSON storage.

Please see the following Structure of the Storage Component diagram and check the repository to understand the utility
of the Storage system to support the many-to-many relationship.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/system/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

===== Create a new Participation
To create a new Participation, the associated Person and Competition must exist. If either doesnt,
an exception will be thrown to the user through the result box to prompt the user to input an existing one.

Format: `addParticipation n/PERSON_NAME c/COMPETITION_NAME s/S1/S2/S3 b/B1/B2/B3 d/D1/D2/D3`

Note: S1 means the 1st attempted weight for the Squat and so on.

===== List Participation
The list participation feature allows the user to filter the participation list on the PCC app based on a particular
competition. If no parameters (competition name) are taken in,
the command will list out all of the participations stored in the system.

Format: `listParticipation` or `listParticipation c/COMPETITION_NAME`

===== Delete Existing Participation
The user can delete an existing participation, maybe in the case he/she has withdrawn or is disqualified
from that competition.

Format: `deleteParticipation INDEX`

We have decided to use the index of the participation in the list to delete a participation instead of
other parameter types, like the name or competition of the participation. The main reason is because,
there may exist more than one participation with the same name and different competition,
or different name and same competition.

Pros:

* Takes in less parameters, user can type less.

* Avoid complications between unmatched name and competition.

* Easy to implement.

Cons:

* User will have to scroll through the participation list on the app to type in the index.


==== Overall Rank feature
The user can list the persons in the system by the number of times they won a competition.

Format: `overallRank`

Due to time limitations we have not allowed the user to specify any other ranking method but given
the design of our system which is highly extensible, it would not be hard to do so in future
versions.

Pros:

* Takes in no parameters so user will make minimal mistakes.

* Avoid complications between unmatched name and person.

* Easy to implement.

Cons:

* User will have to scroll through the person list if it is very long to find a specific name.
