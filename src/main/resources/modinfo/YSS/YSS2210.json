    "description": "This course provides a general introduction to the main currents in social theory from World War II up to the present day. It covers key works from across the social sciences by seminal thinkers such Edward Said, Albert Hirschman, Martha Nussbaum and Pierre Bourdieu. The course is in three parts. Part I asks 'what is the social' and 'what can we know about it?' Part II examines competing conceptualizations of society in terms of markets, culture, institutions, social fields and actor networks. Part III looks at rival theorizations of public life, human freedom, ethnicity and modernity.",
