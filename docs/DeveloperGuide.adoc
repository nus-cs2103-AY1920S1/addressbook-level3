== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TutorAidParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

// tag::accountStorage[]
==== Account Storage
All accounts are stored in a JSON file called accountslist.json. This file is generated once you register an account. The username
and password is stored inside the the JSON file with salt hashing thus, the account details cannot be seen by everyone.

*Design Considerations*
We realised that storing the accounts by itself would allow anyone to see the username and passwords. Hence, we decided to
use a password authentication method and salt hashing to cover the passwords of the accounts.

In addition, we decided to go with using a JSON file instead of XML file due to these considerations:

.Account File Storage function alternatives
[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
| Design Consideration | Pros and Cons
| JSON File (Current Choice)   | *Pros* : More familiarity with JSON files. More compact and can be easily loaded. Flexible

                                        *Cons* : Bad Schema support and namespace support

| XML File | *Pros* : Easy transfer of data between seperate systems. Good at storing data that will be readby 3rd parties.

                                        *Cons* : Not familiar with it and we would require more time to learn how to use it.
|=======================

*Security Considerations*
As of now, only password hashing is done to protect the accounts from being seen by unwanted eyes. We have planned ahead of time and decided
to implement better security options for v2.0.

* *Store accounts on a backend server:* The project restricts us and as of now, it is not implemented. The advantages of storing the accounts in  database
is that it can be a lot more secure.

* *Encrypt the Account JSON file:* This will prevent other users from easily clicking into the data file and make it more secure.
// end::accountStorage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::earnings[]
=== Earnings Feature

==== Add Earnings

The `add_earnings` command allows for tutors to add their earnings into TutorAid.

The format for the `add_earnings` command is as follows:

 add_earnings d/<DATE> type/<TYPE> c/<CLASSID> amt/<AMOUNT>

*Overview*

The `add_earnings` mechanism is facilitated by `AddEarningsCommand` and `AddEarningsCommandParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `Date`, `Type`, `ClassId`, `Amount`, which will construct `Earnings` objects.

.Add Earnings Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddEarningsSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `AddEarningsCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddEarningsCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the user and create
 individual objects based on the prefixes `d/`, `c/` and `amt/`. The `String` value after the respective prefixes
 will create the respective objects. A validation check will be done to ensure that the strings that are entered
by the user is entered correctly. If any of the strings entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to
enter the correct format of the respectives objects.

** `date` would use `ParserUtil#parseDate()` to ensure that the date typed by the user is in the correct format of
DD/MM/YYYY.

** `type` would use `ParserUtil#parseType()` to ensure that the type entered by the user is valid.

** `classId` would use `ParserUtil#parseClassId()` to ensure that the class id typed in by the user is in the correct format.

** `amount` would use `ParserUtil#parseAmount()` to ensure that the amount entered by the user is in the correct format with
2 decimal places to represent the cents.

* After validation of the individual objects, an `Earnings` object would be created with the parameters `date`, `type`, `classId`
 and `amount`.

* `AddEarningsCommandParser` would then return a `AddEarningsCommand` object with the parameter, `Earnings` object.


*Example Scenerio*


* Step 1: The user enters `add_earnings d/04/08/2019 type/tut c/CS1231 amt/50.00` to add an earning for teaching classes.
This adds an `Earnings` object that the user has earned by teaching a CS1231 tutorial class on 4th August 2019. The user has
earned $50.00.

* Step 2: `LogicManager` would use `TutorAidParser#parse()` to parse input from the user.

* Step 3: `TutorAidParser` would match the command word given by the user with the correct command. In this example,
the given command is `add_earnings`, thus, `AddEarningsCommandParser` object would be created with the user's input.

* Step 4: `AddEarningsCommandParser` performs a validation check on each of the respective objects through
`AddEarningsCommandParser#parse()`. In this case, it would use `ParserUtil#parseDate()`, `ParserUtil#parseType()`, `ParserUtil#parseClassId()`
and `ParserUtil#parseAmount()`. It would then return a `AddEarningsCommand` object with an `Earnings` object.

* Step 5: `LogicManager` would execute `AddEarningsCommand#execute`. In this particular method, the `Earnings` object will be
check with the rest of the prior `Earnings` object, to ensure that there is no duplicate `Earnings` object. If there are no similar
`Earnings` object with the same parameters created previously, it would then be added into the earnings list.

* Step 6: `AddEarningsCommand` would then return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`, which would show the user that the new `Earnings`
object have been successfully added.
// end::earnings[]

==== Delete Earnings
This command allows the user to delete an earnings from the existing earnings list through
its index.

The delete earnings command is facilitated by the `DeleteEarningsCommand` and `DeleteEarningsCommandParser`.

The delete earnings command is part of the logic component of our application. It interacts with the model component
of or software application.

*Overview*

The `DeleteEarningsCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `DeleteEarningsCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in an `int` input from the user, that the
 user wants to delete, which will correspond to the index shown on the earnings list on the application. This will delete
 the earnings in the earnings list. If an invalid format is entered or an invalid index is entered, there will be a prompt
 from the commmand parser.

*Current Implementation*

The delete earnings command is executed by the `DeleteEarningsCommand`. Currently, the deletion of any earnings is done based
on the `INDEX` of te earnings entry.

During the design of our delete earnings function, we considered between two alternatives.

* *Alternative 1: (Current Choice)*
Delete Earnings by Index.
** *Pros:* Each earnings is already listed with a unique index, deletion by index is intuitive, less prone to bugs and
 easier to implement.

** *Cons:*  If the user has added a long list of earnings, the user has to look through the whole list and scroll down
to look for the index of the earnings that the user wants to delete.

* *Alternative 2:*
Delete Earnings by Class Id or Date.
** *Pros:* User has no need to scroll through the list and can delete the earnings in mind easily by typing in the class id or
 the date.

** *Cons:* Different Earnings might have similar class id and/or date, thus deleting by class id or date might
cause many earnings to be deleted or the wrong ones to be deleted.

We have decided to go with the first alternative as it reduces the number of potential bugs and the complexities involved
when taking into accout the different cases and scenarios upon the second alternative. In addition, by using the first alternative,
users can take advantage of the `find_earnings` command and then delete from that list.

==== Update Earnings
*TutorAid* allows the user to update any earnings by using a combination of its `INDEX` and any of the attributes of earnings.

* `update_earnings 3 type/tutorials`
* `update_earnings 1 d/03/11/2019`

The above commands update the earnings type at index 3 on the list to type-tutorials and updates the earnings date at
index 1 to date 03/11/2019.

*Current Implementation*

The `UpdateEarningsCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `UpdateEarningsCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in an `int` input and any combination of the attributes
of earnings that the user wants to update, namely: `DATE`, `TYPE`, `AMOUNT` and `CLASSID`. Attributes that are to be updated
have to be preceded by their respective prefixes, `d/`, `type/`, `amt/` and `c/`. A validation check will be imposed upon updating of each
object. Any checks that fails the verification will prompt the user on the failed attribute.

Here is a step-by-step process on how the update earnings command alters and updates the attribute of the earnings entry.

*Example Scenario*

* Step 1: The user enters `update_earnings 3 c/CS1101S` to correct a mistake in entering the `CLASS_ID`
for an earning for teaching classes. This updates the `Earnings` object at index 3 and changes the class id to
CS1101S.

* Step 2: `LogicManager` would use `TutorAidParser#parse()` to parse input from the user.

* Step 3: `TutorAidParser` would match the command word given by the user with the correct command. In this example,
the given command is `update_earnings`, thus, `UpdateEarningsCommandParser` object would be created with the user's input.

* Step 4: `UpdateEarningsCommandParser` performs a validation check on each of the respective objects through
`UpdateEarningsCommandParser#parse()`. In this case, it would use `ParserUtil#parseClassId()`.
It would then return a `UpdateEarningsCommand` object with an `Index` object and an `EditEarningsDescriptor` object.

* Step 5: `LogicManager` would execute `UpdateEarningsCommand#execute`. In this particular method, another
method `UpdateEarningsCommand#createEditedEarnings` would make use of the `EditEarningsDescriptor` object to
create a new `Earnings` object. Afterwards, this `Earnings` object would be check with the rest of
the prior `Earnings` object, to ensure that there is no duplicate `Earnings` object. If there are no similar
`Earnings` object with the same parameters created previously, it would then be added into the earnings list.

* Step 6: `UpdateEarningsCommand` would then return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`, which would show the user that the new `Earnings`
object have been successfully updated.

// tag::otherEarnings[]
==== Weekly Earnings
The `weekly_earnings` command allows users to add earnings into a list that adds earnings weekly automatically by invoking the `auto` command.
This helps to lessen the workload on the user as the user does not need to add a new earnings every week.

The format for the `weekly_earnings` command is as follows:

 weekly_earnings INDEX count/<NUM_OF_WEEKS>

*Overview*

The `weekly_earnings` mechanism is facilitated by `AutoAddEarningsCommand` and `AutoAddEarningsCommandParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `Index` and `Count`, which would be associated with the  `Earnings` object that is
referenced from the `Index`. The `Count` object represents the number of weeks the earnings are to be added to the list.

The `AutoAddEarningsCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AutoAddEarningsCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in an `int` input from the user, followed by a
 `String` input from the user and create individual objects based on the prefix `count/`. The `String` value after the prefix
will create a `Count` object. A validation check will be done to ensure that the string that is entered
by the user is entered correctly. If the string entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to
enter the correct format of the `Count` object.

** `index` would use `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to ensure that the index typed in by the user is in the correct format and is valid.

** `count` would use `ParserUtil#parseCount()` to ensure that the count typed by the user is in the correct format and
between 0 - 13 (inclusive).

* After validation of the individual objects, the particular `Earnings` object would have a `Count` object and be added to a list
that is for automatically adding earnings to the list.

* `AutoAddEarningsCommandParser` would then return a `AutoAddEarningsCommand` object with the parameters, `Index` and `Count` object.

*Example Scenerio*


* Step 1: The user enters `weekly_earnings 2 count/3` to add that indexed earnings to a list of earnings to be added on the
same day of the week, every week. This particular earnings is then added to the list on the specified day for a total of 3 weeks.

* Step 2: `LogicManager` would use `TutorAidParser#parse()` to parse input from the user.

* Step 3: `TutorAidParser` would match the command word given by the user with the correct command. In this example,
the given command is `weekly_earnings`, thus, `AutoAddEarningsCommandParser` object would be created with the user's input.

* Step 4: `AutoAddEarningsCommandParser` performs a validation check on each of the respective objects through
`AutoAddEarningsCommandParser#parse()`. In this case, it would use `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` and `ParserUtil#parseCount()`.
It would then return a `AutoAddEarningsCommand` object with an `Index` and `Count` objects.

* Step 5: `LogicManager` would execute `AutoAddEarningsCommand#execute`. In this particular method, the `Earnings` object will be
check with the rest of the prior `Earnings` object that has been added to the auto addition of earnings list,
 to ensure that there is no duplicate `Earnings` object in the list. If there are no similar
`Earnings` object with the same parameters created previously, it would then be added into the auto addition earnings list.

* Step 6: `AutoAddEarningsCommand` would then return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`, which would show the user that the new `Earnings`
object have been successfully added to the list.

==== Auto Add
This command, `auto`, allows the user to add all the earnings that has been previously added before and the command `weekly_earnings`
 has been used on the particular earnings. You can refer to the activity diagram below to have a clearer understanding.

.Auto Command Activity Diagram
image::AutoActivityDiagram.png[][width="500", align="left"]

*Overview*
The auto command is facilitated by `AutoCommand`.

* `AutoCommand#execute` - This operation checks the current day of the week and checks against the `HashMap` of the earnings list.
If there are `Earnings` object associated with the current day of the week and the `Earnings` object has a `Count` object associated
with it that is more than 1. The earnings inside the `ArrayList` inside the `HashMap` would be added into the earnings list.
// end::otherEarnings[]

=== Calendar Feature

==== Add Tasks
The `add_task` command allows for tutors to add their tasks into TutorAid.

The format for the `add_task` command is as follows:

 add_task c/<CLASSID> mark/<MARKING> tt/<TASKTIME> ...

*Overview*

The add claim `add_task` mechanism is facilitated by `AddTaskCommand` and `AddTaskCommandParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `ClassId`, `Marking`, `TaskTime` which will construct `Task` objects.

.Add Task Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]
NOTE: The lifeline for `AddTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `AddTaskCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddTaskCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the user and create
individual objects based on the prefixes `c/`, `mark/` and `tt/`. The `String` value after the respective prefixes
will create the respective objects. A validation check will be done to ensure that the strings that are entered
by the user is entered correctly. If any of the strings entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to
enter the correct format of the respective objects.

** `classId` would use `ParserUtil#parseClassId()` to ensure that the class id typed in by the user is in the correct format.

** `mark` would use `ParserUtil#parseMarking()` to ensure that the Marking entered by the user is in the correct format with only "Y" or "N".

** `taskTime` would use `ParseUtil#parseTaskTimes()` to ensure that the TaskTime entered by the user is in the correct format.

* After validation of the individual objects, an `Task` object would be created with the parameters `classId`, `Marking`,
and `taskTime`.

* `AddTaskCommandParser` would then return a `AddTaskCommand` object with the parameter, `Task` object.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command.

image::AddTaskActivityDiagram.png[]

*Example Scenerio*


* Step 1: The user enters `add_task c/CS2103T Lecture  mark/Y tt/20/9/2019 13:00, 21/9/2019 16:00 tt/21/9/2019 13:00, 21/9/2019 15:00`
to add an task into the calendar.
This adds an `Task` object, which is a module CS2103T that the user need to attempt at 1pm of 20th and 21st September 2019.
The task is marked so that it would be reminded.

* Step 2: `LogicManager` would use `AddressBookParser#parse()` to parse input from the user.

* Step 3: `AddressBookParser` would match the command word given by the user with the correct command. In this example,
the given command is `add_task`, thus, `AddTaskCommandParser` object would be created with the user's input.

* Step 4: `AddTaskCommandParser` performs a validation check on each of the respective objects through
`AddTaskCommandParser#parse()`. In this case, it would use `ParserUtil#parseClassId()`, `ParserUtil#parseMarking()`, and
`ParserUtil#parseTaskTimes()`. It would then return a `AddTaskCommand` object with an `Task` object.

* Step 5: `LogicManager` would execute `AddTaskCommand#execute`. In this particular method, the `Task` object will be
check with the rest of the prior `Task` object, to ensure that there is no duplicate `Task` object. If there are no similar
`Task` object with the same parameters created previously, it would then be added into the task list.

* Step 6: `AddTaskCommand` would then return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`, which would show the user that the new `Task`
object have been successfully added.
// end::Calendar[]

=== Notes Features
==== Add Notes
The `addnote` command allows for tutors to add their notes into TutorAid.

The format for the `addnote` command is as follows:

 addnote mod/<MODULE_CODE> c/<CONTENT>

*Overview*

The add claim `addnotes` mechanism is facilitated by `AddNotesCommand` and `AddNotesCommandParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `Module_Code`, `Content`, which will construct `Notes` objects.

.Add Note Command Sequence Diagram

The `AddNotesCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddNotesCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the user and create
individual objects based on the prefixes `mod/` and `c/`. The `String` value after the respective prefixes
will create the respective objects. A validation check will be done to ensure that the strings that are entered
by the user is entered correctly. If any of the strings entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to
enter the correct format of the respectives objects.

** `code` would use `ParserUtil#parseModuleCode()` to ensure that the module code typed by the user is in the correct format of
CSXXXX.

** `content` would use `ParserUtil#parseContent()` to ensure that the content typed in by the user is in not empty.

* After validation of the individual objects, a `Notes` object would be created with the parameters `code` and `content`.

* `AddNotesCommandParser` would then return a `AddNotesCommand` object with the parameter, `Notes` object.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command.

=== Reminder Features
==== Add Reminder
The `addReminder` command allows for tutors to add their reminders into TutorAid.

The format for the `addReminder` command is as follows:

 addReminder rd/<DESCRIPTION rt/<TIME>

*Overview*

The add claim `addReminder` mechanism is facilitated by `AddReminderCommand` and `AddReminderParser`, taking in the
following input from the user: `Description`, `Time`, which will construct `Reminder` objects.

.Add Reminder Command Sequence Diagram
##diagram to be added

The `AddReminderCommand` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddReminderParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the user and create
individual objects based on the prefixes `rd/` and `rt/`. The `String` value after the respective prefixes
will create the respective objects. A validation check will be done to ensure that the strings that are entered
by the user is entered correctly. If any of the strings entered are invalid, an error will be shown to the user to

* Step 6: `AddReminderCommand` would then return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`, which would show the user that the new
`Reminder` object have been successfully added.

// tag::learncustomcommands[]
=== Learn wrong commands as custom commands feature
==== Implementation
The main point of this feature is to learn a user's typing habits so as to give them a more seamless experience
while using TutorAid by adapting to their typing style so that they do not have to memorize
built in commands. This is done by having TutorAid trigger in and out of "learner" mode.

A `CommandResult` object now has an added boolean `isUnknown` instance variable to indicate if the command entered is
an unknown command. Using this, TutorAid shifts between "learner" mode and normal mode:

.How TutorAid goes from normal to "learner" mode
image::changeLearner.png[width="800"]

.How TutorAid goes from "learner" to normal mode
image::changeNormal.png[width="800"]

The effect of being in "learner" mode results in the `TutorAidParser` using different methods to parse the command. This will be elaborated on in the sample use scenario below.

While in "learner" mode, TutorAid can map wrong commands to the actions of known commands. These wrong/custom command keywords and their mappings are stored locally in TutorAid.json with
the help of `JsonAdaptedCommand`.

A TreeMap is now being used in the process of parsing commands. New command classes such as `UnknownCommand`, `NewCommand` and `CancelCommand` were also created.

* `TutorAidParser#checkCommand` -- Separate "parser" functions for unknown command operations.
Checks if the command a user wants to map his unknown command to is valid and exists or if the user wishes
to exit the operation.
* `TutorAidParser#initialiseBasicCommands` -- Initialises the functionality of the `TutorAidParser` by adding
the basic command mappings to its TreeMap.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the learn custom command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `TutorAidParser` will be initialized and all basic
commands and previous existing custom commands will be added to its TreeMap via `TutorAidParser#initialiseBasicCommands`.

Step 2. The user enters "plus" instead of "add". `TutorAidParser` does a lookup in its TreeMap in the `TutorAidParser#parseCommand(String userInput)` method and returns a new `UnknownCommand` since
the TreeMap does not contain the keyword "plus".

Step 3. The `UnknownCommand` is executed by `Logic` and "plus" is saved on `savedCommand` in the `Model` component. Subsequently, the `CommandResult` is passed to `MainWindow` to display the corresponding text on the GUI. This `CommandResult` triggers TutorAid into "learner" mode via the earlier explained implementation.

Step 4. TutorAid prompts the user to type in a valid command to map the unknown command to. The user types in another wrong command that is not recognised. This time, he enters "ad" instead of "add". Since TutorAid is in "learner" mode, the method `TutorAidParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)` is now called instead of `TutorAidParser#parseCommand(String userInput)`.

[NOTE]
Logic#execute(String userInput) has been changed to Logic#execute(String userInput, boolean isUnknown) to account for different execution pathways when in normal and "learner" mode.

[NOTE]
`prevUnknownCommand` variable is retrieved from executing a `peek()` command on the `savedCommand` stack in `Model`.

Step 5. In `TutorAidParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)`, the command is still not recognized and another `UnknownCommand` is returned and "ad" is also saved.
Steps 3-5 occurs continuously as long as an unknown command is being supplied or until the user cancels the operation by typing in "cancel".

Step 6. The user inputs a valid command. `TutorAidParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)` now finds the valid command in the TreeMap. With the latest `prevUnknownCommand` retrieved from the stack, the unknown command and action of the valid command is added as a key-value pair to the TreeMap and a `NewCommand` object is returned and executed to store this new command mapping with the help of `Model`.

Step 7. `NewCommand` has a `CommandResult` with an `isUnknown` value of `false`. This will trigger TutorAid back to normal mode. Normal commands can then be performed as `TutorAidParser#parseCommand(String userInput)` will now be called again instead of `TutorAidParser#checkCommand(String userInput, String prevUnknownCommand)`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the learn custom command operation works:

Firstly an unknown command is supplied,

NOTE: The lifeline for `UnknownCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

After which, a known command is supplied,

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the learning of custom commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add all CommandObject objects in the ObservableList<CommandObject> into a TreeMap.
** Pros: Future queries to determine if a command exists or not only requires O(1) time.
** Cons: The first iteration to populate the TreeMap still takes O(n) time.
* **Alternative 2:** Iterate through the ObservableList<CommandObject> to check if the command exists.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate data structure, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. We also
do not need to waste time populating a TreeMap.
** Cons: Every single query costs O(n) time to check if the command exists.

=== Undo/Redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTutorAid`.
It extends `TutorAid` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `tutorAidStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTutorAid#commit()` -- Saves the current tutor aid state in its history.
* `VersionedTutorAid#undo()` -- Restores the previous tutor aid state from its history.
* `VersionedTutorAid#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone tutor aid state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTutorAid()`, `Model#undoTutorAid()` and `Model#redoTutorAid()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTutorAid` will be initialized with the initial tutor aid state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single tutor aid state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the tutor aid. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTutorAid()`, causing the modified state of the tutor aid after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `tutorAidStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted tutor aid state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add_task c/CS2103T ...` to add a new task. The `add_task` command also calls `Model#commitTutorAid()`, causing another modified tutor aid state to be saved into the `tutorAidStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTutorAid()`, so the tutor aid state will not be saved into the `tutorAidStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTutorAid()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous tutor aid state, and restores the tutor aid to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial tutor aid state, then there are no previous tutor aid states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTutorAid()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoTutorAid()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the tutor aid to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `tutorAidStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest tutor aid state, then there are no undone tutor aid states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTutorAid()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the tutor aid, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTutorAid()`, `Model#undoTutorAid()` or `Model#redoTutorAid()`. Thus, the `tutorAidStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTutorAid()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `tutorAidStateList`, all tutor aid states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add_task c/CS2103T ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire tutor aid.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
