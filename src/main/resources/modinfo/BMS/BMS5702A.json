    "description": "This module introduces students to Asian management and leadership through the 15th century historical character from the Ming dynasty of China, named Admiral Zheng He (aka Cheng Ho). It looks at Zheng He from a management and leadership perspective, exploring his overall leadership style and practices, his human resource management, his supply chain management, and his management of faith practices. In particular, we will consider his practices relating to building collaboration with others in what we refer to as Zheng He\u2019s Art of Collaboration (AoC). We will also compare and contrast Zheng He\u2019s AoC with the classic Sun Zi\u2019s Art of War (AoW), considering especially the values and principles embedded in these, and evaluating as to when companies should adopt the AoW and/or the AoC. The module will also attempt to move beyond Zheng He to explore related issues, such as similarities and differences between the western and Asian approaches to collaboration and leadership, the idea of Collaborative Quotient (CQ) and its measurement, the modern day relevance of Zheng He\u2019s key act of collaboration in his practice of generosity, and also the practice of collaboration as seen in the world of insects, birds and animals.",
