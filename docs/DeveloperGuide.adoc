== Introduction

*MoneyGoWhere* is a personal finance application targeted to students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It allows students to keep track of all their spending and their related information such as date, cost and tags.
Users can also set budget goals, view statistics, set reminders for bills and export their data to a .csv file.
With an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) and employment of Command Line Interface (CLI), users can easily navigate through the application, contributing to its user-friendliness and efficiency.


== How To Use This Guide

The following section details and previews a few legends and formatting that will
be used throughout the user guide. These legends are used to represent
special information such as tips.

[NOTE]
Important information that should be noted.

== Setting up


=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.moneygowhere.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, Section 2.1 Architecture>>.


== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::Ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SpendingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ReminderListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Responds to the user's keyboard and mouse input.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

// end::Ui[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]

The following class diagram shows the structure of the Logic component.

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SpendingBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Spending).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The following class diagram shows the structure of the Model component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Spending data.
* stores the Reminder data.
* stores the Budget data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Spending>` and `ObservableList<Reminder>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Spending Book`, which `Spending` can reference. This would allow `Spending Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Spending` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]
// end::model[]

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The following class diagram below displays the structure of the Storage Component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Spending Book data in json format and read it back.
// end::storage[]
[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.moneygowhere.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::updown[]
[[Implementation-UpDown]]
=== Up/Down key

Similar to a typical Command Line Interface(CLI), the up and down key allows the users to cycle through their previous commands.

==== Implementation

The up and down key mechanism is facilitated by the `logic` component of `MoneyGoWhere`.
Whenever a user inputted command is entered, it is stored internally in a list in `commandHistory` component of `Storage`.
`CommandHistory` has an internal index to keep track of its current position in the list.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Logic#getNextCommand()` -- Retrieves the next user input command with respect to the current index.
* `Logic#getPrevCommand()` -- Retrieves the previous user input command with respect to the current index.

The index is initially set to -1, to indicate that that no user input has been inputted.
Whenever a user inputs a command, the command is stored at the end of the list and
the index is set to the size of the list, to indicate that there are no commands beyond after this point.

Calling `getPrevCommand()` will cause the index to decrement by 1 and show the user input command stored at that index.
When the index is currently 0, or the first user command inputted, pressing the up key will cause the index to result in -1.
This returns the empty string, since there are no commands before this point. Any further up key press will have the same
outcome, but the index will stay at -1.

Calling `getNextCommand()` will cause the index to increment by 1 and the user inputted command at that index will be returned.
If the index is currently the last possible value, the last user inputted command, pressing the down key will cause the
index to increment by 1, which is outside the list, the empty string will be returned. Any further down key press
will have the same outcome but the index will stay the list size or last possible index + 1.

The following sequence diagram shows how the up/down key mechanism works:

.Sequence diagram for `getNextCommand()`
image::UpDownSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
`getPrevCommand()` works the same way as the the sequence diagram above for `getNextCommand()`.
The only difference is which commands get returned.

The following steps explain the sequence diagram:

1. The user presses the down key.
2. `LogicManager` calls  `StorageManager#getNextCommand()`.
3. `StorageManager#getNextCommand()` calls `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()`
4. `CommandHistory` returns the next user inputted command.
5. The returned command is then showed to the user in the `CommandBox`.

To summarize what determines the output when the user presses the down key:

.Activity diagram for `getNextCommand()`
image::GetNextCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The following steps explain the activity diagram:

1. The user presses the down key.
2. `CommandHistory` will increment its index.
3. If the index is not out of bounds, the user inputted command at the index will be returned
4. Else, the index is set to the size of the list, and an empty string is returned.

The sequence diagram and activity diagram for `getPrevCommand()` are similar to the sequence and activity diagram of `getNextCommand()` as shown above.
The only difference is whether it returns the next command or the previous command.
// end::updown[]

// tag::find[]
[[Implementation-Find]]
=== Find feature

The find feature allows the user to search for a spending based on specified fields. More fields may added to increase specificity. For example, `find n/Apple c/2.50-3.00` will find an `Apple` of cost range $`2.50` to $`3.00`.

==== Implementation

Find is supported by having a `Predicate` implemented for every field in Spending. Predicates are added based on valid input entered by the user. The `FindCommandParser` class stores these predicates, which are combined using Java 8 streams with an `AND` operation to form a more specific search query.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `find` command is executed:

.Sequence diagram for an example `find` command
[#FindSequenceDiagram,align="center"]
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[pdfwidth="75%",width="75%"]

The following steps explain <<FindSequenceDiagram>>:

1. The user enters `find n/apple`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `SpendingBookParser#parseCommand()`.
3. `FindCommandParser` is created and validates user input, creating a list of `predicates`.
4. `FindCommand` receives `predicates` and stores it in a list.
5. On `execute()`, `predicates` are reduced and `Model#updateFilteredSpendingList(predicate)` is called to refresh the displayed list.

NOTE: The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

To summarise what happens when the user uses the `find` command, the following activity diagram is shown below:

.Activity diagram for an example `find` command
[#FindActivityDiagram,align="center"]
image::FindActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth="75%",width="75%"]

The following steps explain <<FindActivityDiagram>>:

1. The user executes the `find` command.
2. If there are valid inputs, each field from the input is saved as predicates into a predicate list.
3. Else, there are two cases.
.. If there is an invalid field, display an error message for the invalid field.
.. If there is a missing field, display an error message for the missing field.

==== Design Considerations

Listed in the table below are the design considerations for the `find` command.

.Design considerations for `find` command
[#FindDesignConsiderations,width="90%", cols="1,2,2", options="header",]
|===
|Aspect |Alternative 1 (current choice) |Alternative 2

|How find is executed
|Save all predicates to a list +
*Pros:* +
Easy to implement +
Obeys Open-Closed Principle (OCP) +

*Cons:* +
All fields require a predicate
|Access the underlying list and check all related objects. +
*Pros:* +
Able to manipulate objects directly +
  +
*Cons:* +
Poor abstraction +
Requires prior knowledge of the structure of the entire code
|===

Based on <<FindDesignConsiderations>>, Alternative 1 was chosen as it was the easiest to implement and obeys the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) of the SOLID principles. Although Alternative 2 enables checking of the related objects directly, it has poor abstraction and changes in the function require prior knowledge of the structure of the entire code, making it difficult to implement.
// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
[[Implementation-Sort]]
=== Sort feature

The sort feature allows users to sort all currently displayed Spending entries automatically using the `sort` command. The default sorting sequence is by: Date (Descending), Cost (Descending), Name (Ascending) and Remark (Ascending).

For example, `sort n/ASC d/DESC` applies sorting by name in ascending order, followed by Date in descending order. This applies to any future commands entered.

==== Implementation

The sorting feature is supported by `SpendingComparator`, a custom comparator to facilitate different sort ordering, and implements the following operation:

* `updateSortedSpendingList(comparator)` -- Updates the sorted spending list with a new comparator.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateSortedSpendingList(comparator)`.

At a high level view, `SpendingComparator` and `SortField` interacts in the manner shown below.

.High-level view of package interaction
[#SortPackageDiagram,align="center"]
image::SortPackageDiagram.png[pdfwidth="20%",width="20%"]

As shown in <<SortPackageDiagram>>, `SortCommand` has an association to `SortField` and a dependency to `SpendingComparator`.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `sort` command is executed:

.Sequence diagram for an example `sort` command
[#SortSequenceDiagram,align="center"]
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[pdfwidth="75%",width="75%"]

The following steps explain the sequence diagram:

1. The user enters `sort n/ASC`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `SpendingBookParser#parseCommand()`.
3. `SortCommandParser` is created and validates user input, creating a set of `fields`.
4. `SortCommand` receives `fields` and stores it.
5. On `execute()`, `fields` are passed into a `SpendingComparator` object and `Model#updateSortedSpendingList(comparator)` is called to refresh the displayed list.

NOTE: The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when the user uses the `sort` command:

.Activity diagram for an example `sort` command
[#SortActivityDiagram,align="center"]
image::SortActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth="75%",width="75%"]

The following steps explain <<SortActivityDiagram>>:

1. The user executes the `sort` command.
2. If there are valid fields from the input, each field is saved into a list and determines sort order for `Model`.
3. Else, there are two cases.
.. If there is an invalid field, display an error message for the invalid field.
.. If there is a missing field, display an error message for the missing field.

==== Design Considerations

.Design considerations for `sort` command
[#SortDesignConsiderations,width="90%", cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Aspect |Alternative 1 (current choice) |Alternative 2

|How sort is executed
|Set a new comparator +
*Pros:* Easy to implement +
*Cons:* `SpendingComparator` may be updated when new fields are added
|Sort the underlying list without a comparator +
*Pros:* Able to manipulate objects directly +
*Cons:* Violates fundamental Object Oriented Principles

|Method design for sort
|Create filtered list from sorted list +
*Pros:* Easy to implement +
*Cons:* Minor structure changes
|Create sorted list from filtered list +
*Pros:* Able to test large sorting side effects +
*Cons:* Large code structure changes
|===

Based on <<SortDesignConsiderations>>, Alternative 1 was chosen as it was the easiest to implement and it does not violate Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) of the SOLID framework. The only downside of this approach is that changing any field classes may require modifying `SpendingComparator`.

In contrast, for Alternative 2, manipulating the internal elements of the list directly is dangerous and can cause unintended side effects. There was also a huge difference for the method design for sort, and Alternative 1 was the easier approach to avoid side effects in Alternative 2.
// end::sort[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder feature

With this reminder feature, users can set the reminders of their tasks with deadlines and delete them when completed.

==== Implementation

A reminder is constructed with

* Deadline `d/DATE`
* Reminder Message `m/MESSAGE`

The recorded reminders sorted with deadline in descending order, are displayed on the User Interface(UI) for notification.

This feature is implemented with the following operations:

* Adding a reminder `reminder add d/DATE m/MESSAGE` +
e.g. `reminder add d/30/08/2020 m/Pay school fee` - set reminder to pay school fee by 30th of August 2020

* Deleting a reminder `reminder delete INDEX` +
e.g. `reminder delete 1` - delete the first reminder in the reminder list shown in UI.

Below is the activity diagram describing the steps take by MoneyGoWhere when it receives `AddReminderCommand`.

.Activity diagram for adding a reminder
image::AddReminderActivityDiagram.png[width=75%]

[NOTE]
In the above diagram, it can be seen that respective error messages will be shown for invalid inputs.

Shown below is the sequence diagram containing the interactions between respective components in MoneyGoWHere when user inputs `AddReminderCommand`.

[NOTE]
The above sequence diagram demonstrates how a new reminder is constructed from valid user input.

Following is the activity diagram including the series of actions performed by MoneyGoWhere when it receives `DeleteReminderCommand`

.Activity diagram for removing a reminder
image::DeleteReminderActivityDiagram.png[width=75%]

[NOTE]
The negative index from user input will leads to invalid command format error.

The below sequence diagram summarize the interactions between different components when user enter `DeleteReminderCommand`.

.Sequence diagram while user attempt to remove a reminder

[NOTE]
The above diagram also highlights how logic and model components interact with each other while deleting a reminder.
// end::reminder[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import Feature
[NOTE]
====
The current implementation only imports spending data.

*Coming in version 2.0*, +
Reminder and budget data will also be imported.
====
==== Implementation
The import feature allows our users to import data from a comma-separated values (Csv) files.
It allows users to add their spending in bulk.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("import p/validSpending.csv")`

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `import` Command
image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[width=100%]

The Import Feature has one main component, which is the `ImportCommand.java` file. This file contains the main logic behind the feature.
The `ImportCommand#readSpendingFromCsv()` method utilises the `FasterXML/jackson` library to read in Csv files and convert it into maps of objects.
The maps will then be processed and parsed into `Spending` objects which will be added into a `Spending` list.
Those maps that do not pass the parse conditions will then be thrown as an exception and its message will be saved inside an error list.
After all the maps are processed, the application will then go through the valid spending list and save them by calling the `Model#addSpending()` method.
Following that, the application will then prints an output, showing the result of the command execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an import command:

.Import Feature Activity Diagram
image::ImportActivityDiagram.png[width=25%]

When a user calls the `import` command and inputs a valid Csv file, the application will read and parses all the data inside the file and save them to the `SpendingBookList` and `moneygowhere.json`.

==== [[csv-constraints]]Csv File Format and Constraints
In order for data to be imported into MoneyGoWhere, it must be in a properly formatted Csv file.
There should be 5 columns specified for `Name`, `Cost`, `Date`, `Tag` and `Remark`

Header Constraints

* The first row is read in as the header and is *required*.

Cell Formatting

* There should not be any leading and trailing spaces in a cell.
* To specify a comma within a cell, the value of the cell should be inside double quotes. Eg:
** "yummy, juicy"
** "fresh, clean"
* To specify double quotes within a cell, in addition to start and end double quotes, escape the double quote with another double quote. Eg:
** """yummy"", ""juicy"""
** """fresh"", ""clean"""

==== Design Considerations

[width="90%", cols="1,2,2", options="header",]
|===
|Aspect |Alternative 1 (current choice)|Alternative 2

|How import executes
|Imports the entire Csv file, converts all the rows into a list of `spending` objects and add the list into the spending list. +

*Pros:* +
Better performance +
 +
*Cons:* +
Requires additional functions to successfully implement the feature.

|Imports the Csv file, converts all the rows into a list of `spending` objects and add each `spending` object one by one.  +

*Pros:* +
Easy to implement. +
Re-use existing functions +
 +
*Cons:* +
May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

|===

Alternative 1 was chosen as it gives a much better performance as opposed to alternative 2.
At first alternative 2 was chosen as it was easier to implement.
However, performance issues was detected when importing more than 50 spending and
when importing more than 1000 spending, the whole application stops responding.

Hence, alternative 1 was implemented and now the application could handle large amount of spending without a noticeable sluggishness in performance.
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export Feature
[NOTE]
====
The current implementation only exports spending data.

*Coming in version 2.0*, +
Reminder and budget data will also be exported.
====
==== Implementation
The export feature allows our  users to export their spending into a comma-separated values(Csv) files.
It allows users to export their spending allowing the spending data to be portable.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for the interactions withing the `Logic` component for the `execute("export p/Documents")`

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `export' Command
image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[width=100%]

The export feature has one main component, which is the `ExportCommand.java` file. This file contains the main logic behind the feature.
The 'ExportCommand#execute()' method utilises the `FasterXML/jackson` library to read in the `.json` file where the application keeps the spending data.
After the data has been read successfully, it is converted and written into `moneygowhere.csv` file. This file will be created at wherever the user specifies.
After the data has been successfully exported, the application will then prints an output, showing the result of the command execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an export command:

.Export Feature Activity Diagram
image::ExportActivityDiagram.png[width=25%]

When a user calls the `export` command and inputs a valid folder path, the application will convert all the spending data into a Csv file and export it to `moneygowhere.csv`

// end::export[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics feature
==== Current Implementation
For the current `statistics` feature, there are 2 main commands that the user can execute.

1. `stats` - display statistics for all spending
2. `stats d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` - display statistics for spending within a date range

The `StatsCommandParser` differentiates these 2 commands based on whether a valid date range is provided as illustrated in the diagram below.

.Activity Diagram showing behaviour of StatsCommandParser
image::StatsActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

. If a valid date range is provided in the `stats` command given by the user, `StatsCommand(DATE_START, DATE_END)` with the respective date parameters is created. The command will execute based on this date range.
. If no date range is provided by the user, `StatsCommand()` is created, which will execute the command based on the whole date range in the list.
. Else, if the parameters are invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown and the application waits for a new user input.

The implementation of the Statistics feature can be split into 2 phases, preparation and execution. Given below is an explanation of how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each phase.

===== Preparation

During the preparation phase, the program parses the command for Statistics and verifies the arguments.
The following sequence diagram shows how `stats` command works during the preparation phase.

.Sequence Diagram demonstrating the preparation stage of Statistics feature
image::StatsSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `StatsCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

1. User first enters a `stats` command.

2. `SpendingBookParser` will parse and identify the command as a `StatsCommand` and pass on the argument to `StatsCommandParser`.

3. If no arguments were provided by the user, `StatsCommand#StatsCommand()` is called to create a `StatsCommand` with no parameters.
Otherwise, `StatsCommandParser` will verify whether the arguments provided were valid.
.. If they are valid, `StatsCommand#StatsCommand(DATE_START, DATE_END)` is called to create a `StatsCommand` with the specified parameters.
.. Else, a `ParseException` will be thrown and an error message will be shown to the user.
4. `StatsCommand` is returned to `LogicManager` which then calls `StatsCommand#execute()`.
5. `Model#updateFilteredSpendingList(predicate)` is subsequently called to update the list.

===== Execution

In the execution phase, the program processes and retrieves the data to be displayed and finally displaying it.
Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation.

.Sequence Diagram demonstrating the execution stage of Statistics feature
image::StatsDataSequenceDiagram.png[width = "400"]

1. Upon checking that the boolean `isShowStats` = true, the `MainWindow` calls `LogicManager#getStatsData()`.

2. `LogicManager` then gets the filtered list by calling `Model#getStatsList`, which returns an unmodifiable `ObservableList`, containing only spending within the specified date range.

3. `LogicManager#getStatsData()` then processes the spending and organise the data into a `LinkedHashMap<String, Double>` where the key value pairs represents tag and cost respectively.

4. Finally, the `statsData` is returned to the `MainWindow`. The data will be displayed on the Ui through `StatsPanel#loadData(statsData)` call.

// tag::graph[]
=== Graph feature
==== Current Implementation
For the current `graph` feature, there are 2 main commands that the user can execute.

1. `graph` - generates graph for all spending
2. `graph d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` - generates graph for spending within a date range

The `GraphCommandParser` differentiates these 2 commands based on whether a valid date range is provided as illustrated in the diagram below.

.Activity Diagram showing behaviour of GraphCommandParser
image::GraphActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]


. If a valid date range is provided in the `graph` command given by the user, `GraphCommand(DATE_START, DATE_END)` with the respective date parameters is created. The command will execute based on this date range.
. If no date range is provided by the user, `GraphCommand()` is created, which will execute the command based on the whole date range in the list.
. Else, if the parameters are invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown and the application waits for a new user input.


The implementation of the Graph feature can be split into 2 phases, preparation and execution. Given below is an explanation of how the Graph mechanism behaves at each phase.

===== Preparation

During the preparation phase, the program parses the command for Graph and verifies the arguments.
The following sequence diagram shows how `graph` command works during the preparation phase.

.Sequence Diagram demonstrating the preparation stage of Graph feature
image::GraphSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `GraphCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

1. User first enters a `graph` command.

2. `SpendingBookParser` will parse and identify the command as a `GraphCommand` and pass on the argument to `GraphCommandParser`.

3. If no arguments were provided by the user, `GraphCommand#GraphCommand()` is called to create a GraphCommand with no parameters.
Otherwise, `GraphCommandParser` will verify whether the arguments provided were valid.
.. If they are valid, `GraphCommand#GraphCommand(DATE_START, DATE_END)` is called to create a `GraphCommand` with the specified parameters.
.. Else, a `ParseException` will be thrown and an error message will be shown to the user.
4. `GraphCommand` is returned to `LogicManager` which then calls `GraphCommand#execute()`.
5. `Model#updateFilteredSpendingList(predicate)` is subsequently called to update the list.

===== Execution

In the execution phase, the program processes and retrieves the data to be displayed and finally displaying it.
Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation.

.Sequence Diagram demonstrating the execution stage of Graph feature

// end::graph[]

// tag::budget[]
=== Budget Feature
The `Budget` component has two core features:

1. Allowing the user to set the monthly budget
2. Calculating the remanding budget after all the spending in the same month.

The budget component allows the users to modify the current monthly budget `budget AMOUNT` command, where AMOUNT is a
double representing the desired monthly budget. The amount cannot exceed 1,000,000,000 Singapore dollars.

For example `budget 10000` sets the current monthly budget to 10000.

[NOTE]
The budget amount must be a positive number no greater than 1000000000 Singapore dollars and must only have two digits after
the decimal point.

The second functionality is done automatically by the program, which finds the total spending in the month and reduces
the sum from the budget.

==== Current Implementation
The current `Budget` component keeps track of three variables:

1. The monthly budget amount.
2. The month the budget is set.
3. The sum of all spending in the month.

The budget amount and the month the budget is set are saved in the save file, whereas the sum is not.
Upon initialization, if a save file is found it will automatically set the monthly budget based on the save file's options.
Once the save file is loaded, the program will check today's month.
If the month has changed, the budget's set month will change to the current month, and the budget amount will carry over.
Once the month has been set, it will go through all spending available and sum up all the spending that are in the set month.
It will then keep track of this sum.

Once done initializing, users can set a new monthly budget by executing the `budget` command.
The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the budget command is executed:

.Sequence Diagram when setting Budget
image::SetBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]
The figure above shows the sequence of events that occur to set the monthly budget:

1. User first enters "budget 100000".
2. The `LogicManager` receives the user input and passes it to the `SpendingBookParser`, which passes it to `BudgeCommandParser`
to parse the user input.
3. If the user input is valid, a `BudgetCommand` is then created.
4. The `BudgetCommand` is then executed.
5. The Budget in Model then set to the new amount.

Budget also keeps track of the sum of all spending in order to show the user how much budget the user has left.
Initially, it has totaled up all spending in the save file, and then the value is modified when the `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands are called.

The following sequence diagram will demonstrate how Budget modifies its value when the `add` command is used:

.Sequence Diagram for `Budget` when `add` command is called
image::BudgetAddSpendingSequenceDiagram.png[]
The diagram above shows what happens when an `addCommand` is being executed. It focuses only on the components that affect `Budget`.

When adding a new `Spending` the following steps happen:

1. The new `Spending` is passed to Model to be added.
2. The new `Spending` is then passed to `SpendingBook` to be added.
3. SpendingBook passes the `Spending` to `Budget`.
4. `Budget` checks whether the `Spending` is in the same month as it is set or not.
5. If they are in the same month, the sum of `Budget` is updated accordingly.

The same applies to `delete` commands, instead of adding to the sum, it is subtracting from the sum.
As well as `edit` command, which utilizes both `add` and `delete`.

==== Design Consideration

[width="90%", cols="1,2,2", options="header",]
|===
|Aspect |Alternative 1 |Alternative 2

|Method to calculate sum of spending
|Keep track of the sum and modifies the sum when `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands are called +
Pros: Does not waste time to calculate sum. easy to implement. +
Cons: We need to keep track of the sum when saving.
|Calculate from `SpendingList` each time +
Pros: Seems intuitive. +
Cons: It is not efficient, we need to go through the entire each time to calculate sum.

|===
A combination of the two was chosen. During the initialization phase, we read through
all spending available, but we handle `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands using option 1.
// end::budget[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSpendingBook`.
It extends `SpendingBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `spendingBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSpendingBook#commit()` -- Saves the current spending book state in its history.
* `VersionedSpendingBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous spending book state from its history.
* `VersionedSpendingBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone spending book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, `Model#undoSpendingBook()` and `Model#redoSpendingBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSpendingBook` will be initialized with the initial spending book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single spending book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th Spending in the spending book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, causing the modified state of the spending book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `spendingBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted spending book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new Spending. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, causing another modified spending book state to be saved into the `spendingBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, so the spending book state will not be saved into the `spendingBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the Spending was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#spendingBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous spending book state, and restores the spending book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial spending book state, then there are no previous spending book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSpendingBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoSpendingBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the spending book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `spendingBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest spending book state, then there are no undone spending book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSpendingBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the spending book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, `Model#undoSpendingBook()` or `Model#redoSpendingBook()`. Thus, the `SpendingBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSpendingBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `SpendingBookStateList`, all spending book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

[width="90%", cols="1,2,2", options="header",]
|===
|Aspect |Alternative 1 (current choice)|Alternative 2

|How undo & redo executes
|Saves the entire spending book. +
*Pros:* +
Easy to implement. +
 +
*Cons:* +
May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

|Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
*Pros:* +
Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the Spending being deleted). +
 +
*Cons:* +
Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

|Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
|Use a list to store the history of spending book states. +
*Pros:* +
Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
 +
*Cons:* +
Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, it requires remembering to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedSpendingBook`.

|Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
*Pros:* +
Do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
 +
*Cons:* +
Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: Requires remembering to skip these commands. +
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

== Documentation


We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Editing Diagrams

See <<UsingPlantUml#, UsingPlantUml.adoc>> to find out how to create and update the UML diagrams in the developer guide.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====


== Testing


=== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

=== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.moneygowhere.commons.StringUtilTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.moneygowhere.storage.StorageManagerTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.moneygowhere.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: Keyboard and mouse movements are not simulated on macOS Mojave, resulting in GUI Tests failure.**

* Reason: From macOS Mojave onwards, applications without `Accessibility` permission cannot simulate certain keyboard and mouse movements.
* Solution: Open `System Preferences`, click `Security and Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility`, and check the box beside `Intellij IDEA`.

.`Accessibility` permission is granted to `IntelliJ IDEA`
image::testfx-idea-accessibility-permissions.png[width="600"]


== Dev Ops


=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews

When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, MoneyGoWhere depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
