    "description": "The module will address the salient aspects of how evidence informs policy making, covering the following areas: needs assessment; evidence generation and synthesis; presentation of evidence in an appropriate, useful and actionable manner; strengthening evidence generating and presenting capacity in low income countries; barriers and aids to use of evidence by policy-makers; engaging the public; and effectiveness of methods and processes to achieve evidence-informed policy. Health policy is used to illustrate concepts and practice, but principles are equally applicable to policy development in other sectors. The module will emphasize case studies from real policy situations but will also address the importance of sound conceptual frameworks.",
