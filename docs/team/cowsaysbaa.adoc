== PROJECT: ModuleBook

== Overview

As part of the project requirement of CS2103T offered by NUS, my team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We decided to morph the addressbook into a module management application called ModuleBook designed specifically for NUS students.

ModuleBook is a desktop module manager application designed with the needs of NUS students in mind. It is designed to streamline the process of managing time and resources related to the modules offered by NUS. The user interacts with ModuleBook using command line interface, which also comes with graphic user interface created with JavaFX. ModuleBook is written in Java.

As of the current build (v1.4), ModuleBook offers the following features:

. Detailed archive of all modules offered by NUS (adapted from NUSMods API).
. Track modules of interest.
. Search for specific modules using search filters.
. Add personalised deadlines to tracked modules.
. Add links to tracked modules.

My role was to adapt and migrate the base code of addressbook to the requirements of ModuleBook, as well as to design and enhance the operations related to tracking a module. This includes the add, delete, list and find command.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section documents my contribution to this team project in the from of code, documentation as well as supporting the team.

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to find specific modules using filtered search.*
** What it does: Allows the user to search for modules by filtering any combination of the following categories:
. module
. title
. description
. prerequisite modules
. precluded modules
. semesters the modules are offered
** Justification: This feature should be very useful for freshmen students, or students who are unfamiliar with the large selection of modules offered by NUS. These students would be able to able to find a module of their interest without requiring in depth knowledge of specific details related to these modules.
** Highlights: The search is is able to detect and ignore minor spelling mistakes when searching within the title or description. Searching is also extremely fast, with most search cases taking less than a second. These would definitely improve the user friendliness of the search feature.
** Credits: Module information is directly adapted from the API provided by NUSMods. The adaptation and storage of module information is done by Ge Shuming, one of the students involved in this project. Without these information, this feature would not be possible.

* *Minor enhancement*: Improved the base add and delete module commands to be more in line with the program specifics.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=cowsaysbaa&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Link to RepoSense]] [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-1/main/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/module/logic/parser/FindCommandParserTest.java[Test code]]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
| This section contains an excerpt for the filtered find feature in the ModuleBook Developer Guide. This should highlight my ability to write a detailed technical documentation and simplify complicated technical knowledge.
