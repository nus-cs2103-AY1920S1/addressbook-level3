== About `Jarvis`

`Jarvis` is a one-stop solution to juggling all aspects of your hectic school life by helping you manage your
schoolwork, finances and CCAs. Offering four main features to bolster your
productivity, you can now always be on top of your:

[[link-main-features]]
1. **Tasks**
2. **Finances**
3. **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)**
4. **NUS Courses**

all in one handy, nifty application. Our aim is to build an intuitive, user-friendly student life organiser
to, as far as possible, alleviate the stress of NUS life.

== Let's get started

Please ensure you have https://www.java.com/en/download/[Java 11] or above installed
on your PC.

1. You can download the latest version of `Jarvis` https://www.google.com/[here].

2. Move `Jarvis` to the directory you would like to use as the
home folder for the application.

3. Run `jarvis.jar` to start the app. You should see something similar when starting the application up:

.Jarvis' Graphical User Interface (GUI)
image::ug/StartUpUI.png[]

{sp} +

In Figure 1, there are three boxes labelled with numbers - these are the shared GUI sections across all the features:

1. `HelpDesk` - Unique to each feature's tab, it will display a list of commands you can use so you do not need to
remember them all!

2. Feature Tabs - The <<link-main-features, four main features>> of `Jarvis` have been split into distinct tabs.
The tab that you are currently on would be underlined in red, as seen in Figure 1.
You can also toggle between tabs by either clicking on the tabs themselves, pressing the `tab` key or by using the
features' `list` commands.

3. Command Result (top) & Command Entry (bottom) Boxes - Keying commands into the Command Entry Box will cause the
respective Command Results to show in the Command Result Box. An invalid command will result in a red border around
the Command Entry Box and an appropriate error message will be displayed in the Command Result Box, as shown in an
example in Figure 2 below.

.Adding a non-existent course into the Course Planner will result in a display like this
image::ug/ErrorMessage.png[]

{sp} +

You can learn more about the each feature's individual GUI and its respective commands in the coming sections.

== Symbols and command format.

Before delving straight into each feature, lets get familiarised with the conventions used in this user guide.

=== Symbols
[NOTE]
This symbol indicates important information.

=== Command format
==== Lower case vs upper case
Words in `lower case` are **commands** used in `Jarvis` while those in `UPPER CASE` are parameters supplied by the user.

Take the following command as an example:

`add-task t/TASK-TYPE des/TASK-DESCRIPTION`

In the above example, `add-task` and the prefixes, `t/` and `des/` are parts of a command while `TASK-TYPE` and
`TASK-DESCRIPTION` are the parameters supplied by the user.

==== Square brackets

Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.

Take the following command as an example:

`add-task t/TASK-TYPE des/TASK-DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]`

In the above example, the command can be used:

* **With a priority level**:
+
`add-task t/todo des/assignment p/high`
+
or

* **Without a priority level**:
+
`add-task t/todo des/assignment`

==== Ellipses

Parameters with `...` can be used once or more.

For example:

`[#TAG]...` is an optional parameter that can be used either none, once or multiple times.

* **Without an optional parameter**:
+
`add-task t/todo des/assignment`
+
or
+
* **With an optional parameter**:
+
`add-task t/todo des/assignment #cs2103t #urgent`

==== Curly braces and pipes

Some commands can take in different parameters. These parameters are represented with a pipe, `|` ,
surrounded by curly braces, e.g `{param1 | param2}`.

For example, the command:

`export {csv | txt | xlsx} f/FILENAME`

can be used

* **With a csv parameter**:
+
`export csv f/MyFile`
+
or

* **With a txt parameter**:
+
`export txt f/MyFile`

==== Date format
Dates follow the following format: `d/m/yyyy`.

For example:

`add-task t/deadline des/assignment d/1/1/1970`

==== Order of parameters

Jarvis can parse parameters to commands in *any order*.

For example, the command can be represented in this format:

* **With the des/ prefix before the d/prefix**:
+
`add-task t/deadline des/assignment d/1/1/1970`
+
or
* **With the d/ prefix before the des/prefix**:
+
`add-task t/deadline d/1/1/1970 des/assignment`

Task Scheduler

:sectnums:
=== Task Planner

A digital planner to help you stay organized; `Jarvis` can help you cope with your interminable lists of deadlines,
events, errands and more. Tagging and prioritizing tasks are just two of the many ways `Jarvis` will
enable you to stay on top of everything you need to do!

.GUI for the Task Planner
image::ug/PlannerUI.png[]

{sp} +

The Planner feature of `Jarvis` has a very intuitive user interface, with three main sections - as seen in Figure 3.

Each task is represented by a task card (an example of which is boxed in green in Figure 3). Each task card has the task
description right at the top, followed by the task type, and the optional fields (if present). The icon at the bottom
of each task card indicates whether a task has been done, or not - a red cross for tasks that have not been completed
and a green tick for tasks that have.

The default display ia a column on the left for all the tasks in the planner, and a column on the right for your
schedule. The schedule consists two lists stacked on top of each other - the top one showing tasks happening on that
day and the bottom showing tasks happening that week.

==== Add a task: `add-task`
The most fundamental command for the Planner - `add-task` adds a task to the Planner.

[[link-attributes]]
A task *must* have a:

* `TASK-TYPE`: `todo`, `event` or `deadline`
* `TASK-DESCRIPTION`: a short description of the task
* `DATE` (for `Event` and `Deadline` tasks only)

A task *may* have the following *attributes*:

* `TAG`: any number of tags, such as `#school` or `#cca`
* `PRIORITY` level: `high`, `medium` or `low`
* `FREQ` frequency: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` or `yearly`

You can refer to the table below for a brief overview of the different command formats for the
different types of tasks.

|===
| Task Type | Format

|`Todo`
|`add-task t/todo des/TASK-DESCRIPTION [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`

|`Event`
|`add-task t/event des/TASK-DESCRIPTION d/START-DATE//END-DATE [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`

|`Deadline`
|`add-task t/deadline des/TASK-DESCRIPTION d/DUE-DATE [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`
|===

NOTE: Duplicate tasks are not allowed in the Planner!

===== Example
----
add-task t/event des/workshop f/weekly d/25/12/2019//26/12/2019
add-task t/deadline des/cs2101 assignment d/20/9/2019 p/high
----

And as simple as that, `Jarvis` can begin to keep track of
your tasks for you!

==== Delete a task: `delete-task`
If you want to keep your list of tasks updated and current, you can easily delete tasks from the planner.

Format: `delete-task INDEX`

where `INDEX` is the **one-based** index of the task list.

===== Example
----
delete-task 3
----

==== Find a task: `find-task`
Too many tasks to comb through? Ask `Jarvis` to find a task for you based on one or more keywords that match the
descriptions of your tasks.

.Display for find-task
image::ug/find-task.png[]

{sp} +

Format: `find-task KEYWORD...`

NOTE: There must be at least one keyword & this command is case-insensitive.

===== Example
----
find-task assignment
find-task homework cs ma1101r
----

==== Update a task's status: `done-task`
Once you have completed a task (hooray!), you can let `Jarvis` know. By default on
`add-task`, all tasks are marked as undone, represented by a `[✗]`. Upon marking the task as done, the task will be
represented with a `[✓]`, as seen in Figure 5 below.

.Comparison between a task that is marked as done, and one that is not
image::ug/done-task.png[]

{sp} +

Format: `done-task INDEX`

where `INDEX` is the **one-based** index of the task list.

==== Sort tasks by attribute: `pull-task`
To get a quick glimpse of all the tasks you have in your Planner that match a certain <<link-attributes, attribute>>,
simply pull all tasks relating to that attribute.

.Display for pull-task
image::ug/pull-task.png[]

{sp} +

Format: `pull-task { t/TYPE | #TAG | p/PRIORITY-LEVEL | f/FREQUENCY-LEVEL | d/DATE }`

===== Example
----
pull-task t/todo
pull-task #cs2106
----

NOTE: `pull-task` is different from `find-task` so as to make a clear distinction between looking for tasks
by task description only (`find-task`), and looking for tasks based on specific attributes (`pull-task`).


==== List all tasks: `list-task`
Lists all the tasks in the Planner. Using `list-task` while on another page of Jarvis will
pull up the Planner tab.

Format: `list-task`

==== Edit a task: `edit-task` [v2.0]
As you approach the deadlines for certain tasks, you might want to increase their priority levels. Soon, you will be able
to edit existing tasks instead of deleting and adding them back in again.

Format: `edit-task INDEX//NEW-DESCRIPTION...`

`NEW-DESCRIPTION` can be a new task description or any of the other <<link-attributes, attributes>>
used to create a task. You can also edit any number of attributes at the same time, each separated with a space.
However, only one instance of each attribute is allowed per command.

NOTE: `NEW-DESCRIPTION` must be tagged with the attribute prefix. For example, if you want to edit the task description
and priority level of a task: `edit-task INDEX//des/NEW-TASK-DESCRIPTION p/NEW-PRIORITY-LEVEL`.

===== Example
----
edit-task 1//des/project part 2
edit-task 2//des/project part 2 d/18/09/2019
edit-task 3//f/weekly
----

==== Clear entries: `clear-task` [v2.0]
Soon you will also be able to delete multiple entries at one go. Tasks can be cleared by `#TAG` or `d/DATE` - where
tasks with the specified tag or date will be cleared.
The command `clear-task` with no parameters succeeding it will result in all tasks
being cleared.

Format: `clear-task [#TAG]... [d/DATE]`

===== Example
----
clear-task #school
clear-task d/12/09/2019
----

Finance Tracker Lookup

Feature by
-> Goh Si Ning
////
{sp} +

=== Finance Tracker
Introducing the Finance Tracker feature of Jarvis - responsible for keeping track of all your purchases,
monthly subscriptions and monthly spending amount.

As students, we often fail to keep our spending habits in check. But do not worry, as with `Jarvis`, you will never
have to worry about not saving enough for that new laptop or yet another trip with your friends.

.GUI for the Finance Tracker
image::ug/FinanceUI.png[]

{sp} +

In Figure 7, you will be able to see a list of purchases on
the left and a list of your monthly subscriptions on the right. On the bottom left, Jarvis will show the accumulative
spending for that month, as well as how much you are left with (if you have set a spending limit).

==== Add a single-use purchase: `add-paid`

Bought another cup of GongCha at UTown? Let `Jarvis` know.

Don't worry about remembering __when__ you made your purchase, as each purchase entered will automatically be set
to its date of entry! Jarvis will then update your monthly expenses accordingly, as well.

Format: `add-paid d/PURCHASE-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`

NOTE: Jarvis will show the latest purchase at the top of the list so you can easily see your last purchase without
scrolling!

===== Example
----
add-paid d/GongCha a/2.8
add-paid d/GongCha a/2.89
----

==== Delete a single-use purchase: `delete-paid`

If you have just returned something that you had bought online, `delete-paid` will remove the purchase at the specified
*one based* index on the list of purchases shown on the Finance tab. Jarvis will update your monthly expenses accordingly - meaning you have more to spend for the
rest of the month without exceeding your budget!

Format: `delete-paid INDEX`

NOTE: `INDEX` corresponds to *one based* index shown on the list __What I bought this month...__ under the Finance tab.
This also means that the index must exist within this list!

==== Find a purchase: `find-paid`
To have a quick view to see what you have been eating for dinner over the last month, you can use `find-paid`
to pull up purchases with descriptions matching `KEYWORD` provided.

.Display for find-paid
image::ug/find-paid.png[]

{sp} +

Format: `find-paid KEYWORD`

===== Example
----
find-paid Gongcha
----

==== Add a monthly subscription: `add-install`
`Jarvis` also supports installments so that you do not need to key in your Netflix subscription fees each month.
Purchases entered with `add-install` will automatically be deducted from your budget at the same time every month.

Format: `add-install d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
add-install n/Phone bill a/43.0
add-install n/Spotify a/9.50
----

==== Delete a monthly subscription: `delete-install`
With finals approaching, you might have decided to remove all distractions to help you study better. Unfortunately,
this would also include your Netflix account.

Format: `delete-install INDEX`

Removing installments will also result in your monthly expenses being updated accordingly.

NOTE: `INDEX` corresponds to *one based* index shown on the list __What I spend on monthly...__ under the Finance tab. This also
means that the index must exist within this list!


==== Edit an installment: `edit-install`
If you have just changed your contract for your phone, let `Jarvis` know! You can easily reflect any changes
to your installments on the Finance Tracker through `edit-install`.

Format: `edit-install INDEX { d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION | a/AMOUNT | d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT }`

===== Example
----
edit-install 1 a/10
edit-install 2 d/Spotify student plan
edit-install 2 d/Spotify student plan a/7.50
----

==== Set a monthly spending limit: `set-limit`
Taking control of your spending might mean asking `Jarvis` to set a cap on your monthly budget.
//todo what happens when you exceed your budget

Format: `set-limit a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
set-limit a/300
set-limit a/500.90
----

==== List finances: `list-finances`
Lists all the purchases in the Finance Tracker. Using `list-task` while on another page of `Jarvis` will
pull up the Finance tab. If you have previously searched through your purchases for something, `list-finances`
will return the original list of purchases.

Format: `list-finances`

==== Export to File: `export` [v2.0]
Conveniently export your expenditures to either a txt, csv, or xlsx file..

Format: `export {csv | txt | xlsx} f/FILENAME`

===== Example
----
export csv f/expenditures
export txt f/MyFile
----

NOTE: Jarvis will export the file containing all expenditures to its current directory.

CCA tracker

Feature by
-> Tan Ye Kai
////
{sp} +

=== CCA tracker
The CCA tracker is a feature unique to `Jarvis`. Entirely customizable based on individual interest,
`Jarvis` can support milestone tracking, equipment management and so much more! Never has being in multiple
CCAs been so easy.

.GUI for the CCA Tracker
image::ug/CcaUI.png[]

{sp} +

All CCAs are added to a main list, with each CCA having a Progress Tracker and an Equipment List, as seen in
Figure 9.
Within the Progress Tracker:

1. Box 1 displays the percentage of milestones of the CCA that have been completed.

2. Box 2 shows all the milestones assigned to that CCA.

3. The area below Box 2 displays the current milestone you are at, the next milestone succeeding the current
one, and the fraction of milestones that have been completed.

==== Add a CCA: `add-cca`
To start, we can add some CCAs to the CCA Tracker. You will need to specify
the name of the cca and the type of the CCA.

Format: `add-cca n/NAME t/TYPE [e/EQUIPMENT]...`

The `types` of the CCA are limited to the following:

* `performingArt`
* `sport`
* `club`
* `uniformedGroup`

===== Example
----
add-cca n/Canoeing t/sport
add-cca n/Piano t/performingArt e/piano e/musical score e/metronome
add-cca n/Red cross t/uniformedGroup e/uniform e/first aid kit e/stretcher e/beret
----

==== Delete a CCA: `delete-cca`
New semester, new CCAs - deleting outdated ones is a breeze.

Format: `delete-cca INDEX`

===== Example
----
delete-cca 1
----

[NOTE]
`INDEX` corresponds to the **one based index** shown on the list of Ccas under the Ccas tab. This also means that the
index must exist within this list!


==== Edit a CCA: `edit-cca`
If you have bought the latest tuner for your piano or some new running shoes, let `Jarvis`
know so that the changes to your CCAs can be updated!

Format: `edit-cca INDEX { n/NAME | t/TYPE | e/EQUIPMENT... | p/MILESTONE... | l/PROGRESS-LEVEL }`

===== Example
----
edit-cca 1 n/Piano t/performingArt e/piano e/musical score e/metronome e/tuner e/piano book
edit-cca 2 n/Running e/shoes e/water bottle e/snack bar
edit-cca 2 p/beginner p/intermediate p/advanced p/half-marathon p/full marathon p/ultramarathon l/5
----

[NOTE]
Note that you will have to re-type each `EQUIPMENT` if you wish to add additional `EQUIPMENT` to the selected cca!

==== List a CCA: `list-cca`
Lists all your CCAs in the CCA Tracker. Using `list-cca` while on another page of Jarvis will
pull up the CCA Tracker tab.

Format: `list-cca`


==== Find a CCA: `find-cca`
For a quick view of CCAs matching one or more keywords, `find-cca` will come in useful.

.Display for find-cca
image::ug/find-cca.png[]

{sp} +

Format: `find-cca KEYWORD...`

===== Example
----
find-cca swimming
find-cca canoeing guitar
----

==== Add progress levels for a CCA: `add-progress`
Often, we strive to reach certain milestones in our CCAs. For example, in learning the piano, you might be aiming to
progress through the various grade levels available. With `add-progress`,
`Jarvis` can help you set and keep track of your progress towards each milestone in each of your CCAs.

Format: `add-progress INDEX p/MILESTONE...`

===== Example
----
add-progress 1 p/Grade 1 p/Grade 2 p/Grade 3 p/Grade 4 p/Grade 5 p/Grade 6 p/Grade 7 p/Grade 8 p/Diploma
add-progress 2 p/LCP p/Corporal p/Sergeant p/Staff Sergeant p/Warrant Officer p/Senior Warrant Officer
----

==== Increment progress level: `increment-progress`
Each time you have made progress towards any of your milestones, let `Jarvis` know! The progress bar for each CCA
provides a clear view of how much closer you are to their respective milestones.

.Display for increment-progress
image::ug/increment-progress.png[]

{sp} +

In Figure 11 above, using `increment-progress` on Swimming will raise the progress percentage from 50% to
62.5%.

Format: `increment-progress INDEX`

===== Example
----
increment-progress 1
----

[NOTE]
Note that progress can only be incremented if `add-progress` has previously been executed on that particular Cca.


==== Add training date: `add-cca` [v2.0]
Need a reminder on Cca trainings? Add training dates to each Cca. Note that the training date is an optional parameter.

Format: `add-cca n/NAME t/TYPE [e/EQUIPMENT]... [d/TRAINING DATE]...`

===== Example
----
add-cca n/Piano t/performingArt d/1/12/2019 d/7/12/2019
----

Course Planner

Feature by
-> Ryan Tan Yu
////

{sp} +

// tag::courseplanner[]
=== Course Planner

Unable to keep track of what modules you have been taking? Need to quickly
know what your CAP is? Want to know how far you are in determining your
focus areas? Jarvis has a feature just for you! The Course Planner serves to
solve these problems.

Thoroughly integrated with https://nusmods.com/[**NUSMods**] (that we as NUS
students often use to plan our timetables) you will be able to consolidate all
the courses you have taken in NUS to date, as well as figure out what courses
you could possible take in the future.

Let's see how the Course Planner looks like:

.GUI for the Course Planner
image::ug/CoursePlannerUI.png[]

{sp} +

The default display for the Course Planner is a list of courses on the left and
an empty Result Box on the right - as shown in Figure 12. This box will display
different pieces of information depending on the commands entered.

Let's see what the Course Planner can do:

==== Add a course: `add-course`
To get started, you can add specific course(s) to your list. Jarvis is able to
add multiple courses at one go.

Format: `add-course c/COURSECODE...`

where `COURSECODE` is the course code of the {nusmods-modules}[NUS course] you
wish to add.

===== Example
----
add-course c/CS1010
add-course c/CS1010 c/CS2030 c/CS2040
----

==== Add a course with grades: `add-course` [v2.0]
If you wish, you may add a course that has a grade attached to it. This is to
facilitate Jarvis' understanding of the courses you have already taken. Jarvis
will use such information in the calculation of your CAP (Cumulative Average
Point).

Format: `add-course c/COURSECODE g/GRADE [c/COURSECODE g/GRADE]...`

where `GRADE` is any
http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/education-at-nus/modular-system.html[valid NUS grade].

===== Example
----
add-course c/CS1010 g/B+
add-course c/CS2040 g/A+ c/CS2100 g/B- c/MA1521 g/B+
----

[NOTE]
Every `GRADE` is tethered to the preceding `COURSECODE`, so the parameters to
this command must be entered in the specified order!

==== Delete a course: `delete-course`
You can easily delete a course from your list - either by the index of the
course in the list, or by its course code.

Format: `delete-course {c/COURSECODE | INDEX}`

===== Example
----
delete-course c/CS1010
delete-course 2
----

==== Look up a course's information: `lookup`
You can also retrieve information about a specific course - such as course
title, course code, number of credits and what the course is about. The
information will be displayed in the result box on the right of the Course
Planner, as shown below:

.Display for lookup
image::ug/lookup.png[]

Any information you will want to know about any course is shown within the
result box.

{sp} +

Format: `lookup c/COURSECODE`

===== Example
----
lookup c/CS1010
----

==== Check a course: `check`
If you are not sure if you can take a certain course next semester, this
feature will come in handy. Simply `check` the course in question. The result
is dependent on the courses you have added to your list, and `Jarvis` will
display a very helpful tree similar to NUSMods to show you what requirements
you need for each course.

.Display for check
image::ug/check.png[]

In this case, the user is unable to take the course **ST23344** as he
has not filled any of the requirements.

{sp} +

Format: `check c/COURSECODE`

===== Example
----
check c/CS1010
----

==== Check your CAP: `cap` [v2.0]
If you wish to check your current CAP (Cumulative Average Point), you can do
so with the command `cap`. Jarvis assumes that any course that does not have
a grade attached to it in your list have not, or are currently being taken
and will not be counted towards you CAP.

Information on the CAP system can be found
http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/education-at-nus/modular-system.html[here].

Undo/Redo

Feature by
-> Marc Fong Yung Kit
////
{sp} +

=== App History

_"Oops! I have entered a command that has entered inaccurate information to the
application, and I am not sure where to find the mistake or how to fix it!"_

It's great that `Jarvis` remembers your changes and allows you to easily `undo` your
commands!

_"Wait! What if I am not sure if I want to undo the changes made by the
command?"_

`Jarvis` also enables you to `redo` any changes that you have undone! Therefore, you
can confidently `undo` and `redo` changes that you have made without worrying about
the inconvenience of remembering and re-entering commands all over again.

[NOTE]
Only commands that make changes to the content of JARVIS can be undone and redone. Commands that
list items or finds items in `Jarvis` therefore cannot be undone or redone.

`Jarvis` remembers the last thousand commands that you have entered into the
application, even after you exit the application!

`Jarvis` also lets you undo and redo multiple commands in a single undo or redo
command! This means that you can undo and redo up to a thousand commands with
a single undo or redo command.

.Display for undo/redo

image::ug/undo-redo-2.png[]

.Display for undo/redo
image::ug/undo-redo-3.png[]

.Display for undo/redo
image::ug/undo-redo-4.png[]

[NOTE]
JARVIS undo and redo commands in a specific sequence:
 +
 +
Undo commands will undo command(s) starting from the latest command the user entered.
 +
 +
Redo commands will redo command(s) starting from the latest command that was undone.

If you are not sure of how many commands you have undone or redone, do not worry!
Jarvis can tell you how many commands you have undone or redone before you make any
further changes!

You can see how to undo and redo commands in JARVIS in the following
sections below, which will cover two new commands:

* `undo [NUMBER]`
* `redo [NUMBER]`
* `list-history`

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to undo/redo.
 +
 +
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer that is not larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone/redone (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` parameter is not
supplied, then `[NUMBER]` is taken to be the value *1*.

==== Undo command(s): `undo`
Format: `undo [NUMBER]`

where `[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to `undo`.

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer, no larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone. (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` is not
supplied, then it is taken to be the default value of *1*.

===== Example

* `undo` -- This command will undo the latest command entered by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `undo 1`
* `undo 5` -- This command will undo the 5 latest commands entered by the user,
starting from the latest command.

==== Redo command(s): `redo`
Format: `redo [NUMBER]`

where `[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to `redo`.

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer, no larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone. (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` is not
supplied, then it is taken to be the default value of *1*.

===== Example

`redo` -- This command will redo the latest command undone by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `redo 1`

`redo 5` -- This command will redo the 5 latest commands undone by the user,
starting from the latest command that was undone.

[NOTE]
If you have entered new commands after undoing previous commands, you will not be able to redo the old
commands.

==== List the number of commands you can undo or redo: `list-history`
`Jarvis` can provide you with the maximum number of commands you can `undo` and `redo` - which will be shown
in the Command Result Box.

Format: `list-history`

Lists the number of available commands to be undone, number of available commands to be redone,
and the limit of the maximum number of commands Jarvis can remember for you to support undo and
redo commands.

==== Walkthrough for `undo`, `redo` and `list-history`

Let's say you would like to delete the first task in the `Planner`, highlighted by the
green box in Figure 19 below.

.Before deleting the task highlighted in the green box

Deleting the task in Jarvis would then trigger the appropriate command result as seen in the
figure below.

.You have just deleted a task as shown in the command result display
image::ug/undo-redo-2.png[]

As shown in the picture below, entering the command `undo`,  would revert the delete command that
you had entered earlier.

.The deleted task is back in Jarvis

You can enter the command `redo`, re-applying the delete command on Jarvis
as shown in the picture below.

.You have just redone that latest undone command
image::ug/undo-redo-4.png[]

You can enter the command `list-history`, displaying the number
of commands that can be undone and redone.
