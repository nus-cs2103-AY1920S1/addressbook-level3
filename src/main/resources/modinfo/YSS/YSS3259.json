    "description": "This module explores the human condition through the lens of literature. We will use novels, essays, plays, poems and visual media to consider characteristics and life events that make us uniquely human from birth through death: identity, human development, love and desire, coping with mental/physical illness, war, poverty, morality and resilience. We will read texts that are notable for their excellence (prize-winning) as well as diversity across time (classics to contemporary) and culture (e.g., authors from Asia, US, Europe). Critical reading, writing and discourse will be cornerstones of this course.",
