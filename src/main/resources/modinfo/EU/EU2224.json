    "description": "This module aims to widen knowledge and appreciation of the film craft by considering innovative, popular and world\u2010renowned work from a major producing region. Can we talk of a European 'regional' cinema, or are we faced with various national traditions? As a film module, it analyses how the visual medium makes meaning and relates the study of film to issues in the theory of representation. The films cover a period from the 1940s to the new millennium, and geographically from Russia to France and the UK.",
