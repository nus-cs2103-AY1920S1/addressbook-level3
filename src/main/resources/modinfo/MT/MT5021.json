    "description": "Engineering and technology managers often have to deal with problems that go beyond their technical domains. This module introduces engineering students to a systematic methodology of problem-solving. The core of this milestone- based method is a structured process comprising 8 stages as well as the relevant tools and techniques. The emphasis is on providing students with a complete picture of the whole problem-solving process, rather than focusing in depth on certain elements of problem-solving (e.g., creative thinking or decision making). The module will focus on problems that are multi-faceted, where solutions are likely to involve trade-offs between technology, people, process, culture, etc. The module will be conducted in the spirit of experiential learning, and at the same time provide students with the theoretical understanding of the methodology and its tools and techniques.",
