    "description": "Modernity may be post\u2010traditional, but it is far from being thoroughly rationalized. Social meanings remain central, and the new approach of 'cultural sociology' has emerged to study them. Providing an introduction to cultural sociology, this course focuses on one of its research programs \u2013 the study of material objects as iconic symbols. We begin with aesthetic theories of sensuous form and cultural theories of symbols and myth, then examine empirical studies ranging from motorcycle boys to Giacometti and celebrities, from to vinyl records to the role of branded cultural consumption in post\u2010industrial societies.",
