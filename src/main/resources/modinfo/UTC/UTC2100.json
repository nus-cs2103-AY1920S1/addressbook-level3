    "description": "One Health (OH) is a novel approach in health policy that perceives human health, non-human animal health, and environmental health as deeply interdependent. It strives to benefit humans, animals and ecosystems by promoting collaboration across disciplines and nations. This module examines scientific, social and philosophical aspects of OH. Featuring fieldtrips to relevant sites such as zoos and laboratories, the module takes Singapore, where governmental agencies are working closely with academic institutions to promote the OH concept, as a case study. At the same time the scope of the various topics is broadened by exposing students to regional and international comparisons.",
