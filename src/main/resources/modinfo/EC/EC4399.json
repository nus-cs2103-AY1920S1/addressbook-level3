    "description": "The aim of this course is to highlight the most important areas of policy analysis in which insights from behavioural economics have fruitfully been applied. It discusses the underlying behavioural theory, and shows how this can be applied to policy analysis. A strong focus of the course is to outline methods and discuss results that focus on empirically testing and quantifying non-standard motives. We also discuss how such policies can be piloted and evaluated within an evidence-based policy framework. The course also showcases how behavioural insights are used in public policy for Singapore.",
