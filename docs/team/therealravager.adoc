== About the project
This project portfolio serves to showcase my contributions to the development and documentation of ORGA__Nice__.
The following sections will introduce the ORGA__Nice__ project and my role in its development.

=== What is ORGA__Nice__?
ORGA__Nice__ is a team project done by a group of five developers including myself. We are second year Computer Science
students from the National University of Singapore. ORGA__Nice__ was developed as part of CS2103T, an introductory
Software Engineering module. ORGA__Nice__ is a desktop application created to help hospital administration staff manage
organ transplants. ORGA__Nice__ was developed with the assumption that they prefer typing compared to other forms of
usage. As such, ORGA__Nice__ utilises a Command Line Interface - a text-based system where users type in commands to
execute tasks rather than clicking buttons. As part of the module, ORGA__Nice__ is morphed from an existing project,
https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[AddressBook-Level3], an address book management application.

This is what ORGA__Nice__ looks like:

These are the main features of ORGA__Nice__:

* Managing patients, donors and doctors
* Matching patients with potential donors
* Sorting matches by priority, compatibility and organ expiry date
* Finding persons by attributes
* Managing administrative work relating to organ transplants

=== How did I contribute?
My role was to design and implement the find by attribute feature and handle the automatic generation of dummy data on
initial application startup. The following sections illustrate the contributions I have made in implementing said
features, including the relevant documentation for both users and developers.

Do note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

NOTE: This section contains important information.

TIP: This section contains a helpful tip!

`find` A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command box
and executed by the application.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Major Enhancement*: I added the ability to search for persons based on their attributes.

* What it does: Allows the user to search for specific persons (i.e. patients, doctors and donors) based on their
attributes (e.g. name).
* Justification: This feature improves ORGA__Nice__ significantly as a user can look for specific persons quickly rather
than having to scroll through the entire list of persons in ORGA__Nice__.
* Highlights: This feature performs fuzzy matching on the inputted name, NRIC and phone number to allow for relevant
search results to be displayed even if the user makes a typo.
* Pull Requests:
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/143[#143],
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/174[#174],
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/184[#184]

*Minor Enhancement*: I added NRIC checksum validation to ensure input NRICs are valid.

* What it does: Checks that the NRIC input by the user is a valid NRIC.
* Justification: This feature is crucial to the functionality of ORGA__Nice__ as credential correctness is crucial for
hospital administrative workflow.
* Pull Request: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/commit/36a54c909e8a621bacfb0626b0161179f6c3a2d6[#255]

*Minor Enhancement*: I added dummy data generation for initial startup of ORGA__Nice__.

* What it does: Generates dummy data consisting of 10 doctors, 20 patients and 20 donors on inital application startup.
* Justification: This feature is beneficial for hospitals transitioning to using ORGA__Nice__ as it provides users with
data to test out and familiarise themselves with the various commands available in ORGA__Nice__ before using it for
daily work.
* Pull Request: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/commit/9707403685db8ad694d45602b892f3ddece18e5d[#172]

*Other contributions*:

* Git Workflow Management:
** Helped team members resolve Git related issues such as merge conflicts and taught them how to use more complicated
features such as rebasing and stashing.

** Helped the team migrate to a branching Git workflow (Issue https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/issues/39[#39])
** Set up team's GitHub repository including branch protection and requiring Travis checks and reviews before merging.
* Documentation:
