    "description": "This module is divided into two sections. Using examples from the Southeast Asian region, the first focuses on the aims of historical geography and explores different approaches used in the geographer's attempt to reconstruct or interpret landscapes of past times (e.g. changing landscapes, peopled landscapes, imagined landscapes, contested landscapes). Some attention will also be given to the sources of evidence used in reconstructing historical landscapes. The second part examines the significance of studying past landscapes for contemporary purposes. This will involve a discussion of the question of heritage in general, and more specifically, the debate surrounding urban heritage conservation.",
