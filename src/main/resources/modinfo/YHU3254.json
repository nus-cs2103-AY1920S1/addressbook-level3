It will involve close readings and analysis of visual materials (\u201cfloating world pictures\u201d (ukiyo-e)), historical artefacts, literature and film from the later Edo period (1800s) to the modern era to provide an understanding of Japanese culture and history that has conditioned its transformation into one of the major global cities in Asia today.
