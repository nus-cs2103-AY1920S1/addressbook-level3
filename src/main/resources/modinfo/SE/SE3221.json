    "description": "This module will give you a chance to learn to play traditional music from one Southeast Asian country, to understand how the music works, and how music functions in society and reflects cultural values, specifically in the one country. While the first-hand experience of playing ensemble music is an important part of this module, no musical background is required all you need is a positive attitude. Discussions (with audiovisual illustrations) and readings will help you to understand the workings of the music and the historical, cultural and social setting, with an emphasis on understanding music in and as culture.",
