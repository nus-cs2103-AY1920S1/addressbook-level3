    "description": "There are literally thousands of chemical reactions in the field of organic chemistry, but only a handful of them are most relevant to non-chemists (e.g. life scientists). The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion. By using key examples in bioorthogonal chemistry developed in the last decade, the students will focus on interactive learning in unconventional ways (reading, literature search, group discussion, independent studies, presentation, etc). The professor will mostly serve as the facilitator (not feeder) of the learning process.",
