The objective of EIA is to ensure that decision-makers consider environmental impacts before deciding whether to proceed with new projects. Participants are introduced to the concept of EIA, its historical evolution and the terminologies that are used worldwide. Lectures will cover the organizational aspects of EIA, the EIA framework and the procedural methods to conduct an EIA, with special emphasis on water and water related issues.
