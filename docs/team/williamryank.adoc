== About the project

My team and I developed ORGANice during our 2nd year of our Computer Science degree in National University of Singapore for our Software Engineering Project. ORGANice is a desktop application for hospital administration staff who prefer to use Command Line Interface applications to manage organ transplants. The purpose of this project portfolio is to demonstrate my contribution to the project as well as to the user and developer guides

This is what our project looks like:

Below is the list of main features that are available in our application:

* Form mode feature
* Matching feature
* Sorting feature
* Finding feature
* Processing feature

== Summary of contributions
Below are the summary of my contributions for this project which include feature enhancements, project management, and documentation.

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to add a person with form mode*.
** What it does: Allows user to add a person by typing each attribute one at a time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can ensure that he/she enter the person's attributes correctly which is essential for an application that will be used in a hospital.
** Highlights: This feature includes other special commands such as 'undo' if the user typed in a wrong input and `Find Match` button so that the user can click on this button to directly find the potential donor for a patient without typing another command.
