    "description": "The module covers generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy in large-scale modern power system. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to model, analyze, and predict the performance of three-phase systems, transformers, and transmission and distribution networks. The topics covered are: three-phase systems; real, reactive and apparent power. rotating magnetic field; synchronous and asynchronous machines; transformers; single line representation of three-phase systems; per unit notation; electricity transmission networks; high voltage cables; distribution systems; Singapore electricity network; power quality; harmonics; and environmental considerations.",
