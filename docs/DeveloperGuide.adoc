== Introduction

This section specifies the purpose of this document and design goals of Athletick.

=== Purpose

This document describes the software architecture and system design of Athletick, a team management desktop application for coaches and team captains of timing-based performance sports. It also includes some of the design considerations for the implementation of Athletick's features.

The intended audience of this document includes the developers and software testers of Athletick.

=== Design goals

Athletick was developed as part of CS2103T, a software engineering module taken in the National University of Singapore. We were tasked to morph a generic https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[address book application] that manages contacts into an application that manages something else. At the end of the project, it should be ready to be continued by future developers.

As part of the project constraints, the input to Athletick needs to be primarily Command-Line Interface (CLI). Non-CLI inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to our target users. Taking this into consideration, the following principles guide the design of Athletick:

. **Friendlier Syntax**
+
In order to cater to beginner and experienced users of Athletick, we have provided shorter aliases for our command words. This helps new users to use intuitive and self-explanatory commands, while advanced users can accomplish their tasks more quickly with a shorter command syntax.

. **Optimised Performance**
+
Athletick should be able to hold up to 1000 athletes, attendance and performance records without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage. To achieve this, we used optimal data structures for storing and retrieval of data.


. **Designer Friendly**
+
As Athletick is intended for future student developers like us to make modifications and extensions to its behaviour, adhering to the high-level design architecture strictly was a necessity. This translates to extensive use of abstractions for code clarity. Additionally, we provided Javadoc comments for our classes and methods for developers to understand how they work.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== System design

This section introduces the high-level design of Athletick and gives you a basic understanding of how each component operates and interacts with one another.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width=400]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Athletick. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Displays the UI of Athletick.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands from the user.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of Athletick in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width=500]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Athletick data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. We have included our design considerations for you to understand our decision making processes.

=== Training & Attendance feature

To facilitate management of training sessions, the `Model` stores the `Attendance` of training sessions.

image::attendance_class_diagram.png[]

==== Attendance

The attendance of players is managed using an `Attendance` class.
`Attendance` contains a list of training sessions as it is used to calculate the attendance rate of an individual by looking at all trainings.
Whenever a training is added, the model adds this training to the `Attendance` using a `TrainingCommand`.

==== Training

The Training class contains a date, as well as a HashMap.
The date in the training class represents the date of training session and the HashMap is used to check the attendance of a Person.

We used a `DateTime` class to represent a date of training.
This class is shared across both the `Ui` and backend, allowing us to port training data into the `view calendar` function.

The HashMap uses `Person` objects as keys and a boolean as it’s value.
This is used to check whether a `Person` has attended a training session, indicated by the boolean value attached to a `Person` key.
If a `Person` attended a training session on that day, the value associated with the key will be true, and false if he did not attend.
There were a few design considerations we had in mind for checking attendance of a `Person` but we ultimately decided that using a HashMap was the best solution due to the following requirements:

* Our application allows us to check for the attendance rate of a `Person`. As such, we needed to track both trainings attended and trainings missed.
* As a person could be added into the team after some trainings have taken place,
using trainings attended / total trainings would not give an accurate reflection of a `Person` 's training attendance.

Also, our `select` function shows attendance rate of a `Person` and a HashMap provides the fastest access time to check whether a `Person` attended a training session.

=== Performance feature

=== Calendar feature

The calendar feature serves 2 primary functions:

. Provides an overview of training and performance records in a selected month.

. Displays training and performance records entered on a specific date.

==== Implementation

The implementation of the above functions will be described seperately.

The first function is facilitated by `CalendarPanel`. It extends `UiPart<Region>` and represents the calendar via a `GridPane` with dimensions of 7 by 6 (42 cells). Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalendarPanel#retrieveCurrentDate()` -- Retrieves the details of today's date to be used as the title of the calendar feature and for rendering the displayed month on the calendar when the user does not provide a month to view.
* `CalendarPanel#retrieveProvidedDate()` -- Retrieves the details of the date provided by the user for rendering the displayed month on the calendar.
* `CalendarPanel#initialiseSelectedDate()` -- Fills up all 42 cells of the `GridPane` with the respective days based on the selected date (current / provided date) by the user. Days of the previous and next month used to fill up the remaining cells are marked in a lighter colour.

+
In addition, days with training or performance records will be marked with a small orange or purple dot indicator respectively.

These operations are performed when an instance of `CalendarPanel` is created in the `MainWindow` class. An instance of `CalendarPanel` is created when the `CommandResult` obtained after executing the user's command contains a `Feature` corresponding to a calendar and an optional `AthletickDate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the first function and how the operation behaves at each step:

Step 1:. The user either issues the `view calendar` or `calendar [MMYYYY]` (e.g. `calendar 012019`) command. The first command displays the calendar for the current month, while the second command displays the specified the month and year to be displayed.

Step 2. The issued command

// to be continued

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calendar [MMYYYY]` operation works:

// sequence diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `view calendar` or `calendar [MMYYYY]` command:

// activity diagram

The second function is facilitated by `CalendarDetailPanel`. It extends `UiPart<Region>` and displays the attendance and performance records for a specific date in a table. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalendarDetailPanel#initialiseAttendanceData` -- Retrieves and displays the attendance of each person on the specified date.
* `CalendarDetailPanel#initialisePerformanceData` -- Retrieves and displays the performance records on the specified date.

These operations are performed when an instance of `CalendarDetailPanel` is created in the `MainWindow` class. An instance of `CalendarDetailPanel` is created when the `CommandResult` obtained after executing the user's command contains an `AthletickDate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the second function and how the operation behaves at each step:

Step 1:. The user either issues the `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` (e.g. `calendar 01012019`) command.

Step 2. The issued command

// to be continued

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` operation works:

// sequence diagram

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` command:

// activity diagram (show what happens when records found vs not found)

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How the calendar for the current month is displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays using a fixed 7 by 6 `GridPane`, fill up left over days with days from previous and next month.

* **Alternative 2:** Displays using a variable sized `GridPane` that is populated with days from selected month only.

===== Aspect: How the user can display the attendance and performance data on a specific date
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have one `calendar [DDMMYYYY]` command to view _both_ attendance and performance data on the specified date.

* **Alternative 2:** Have two separate commands to view attendance and performance separately on the specified date.

=== Select feature
==== Implementation
The select feature is facilitated by `SelectCommand` class. It extends `Command` and parses the arguments using
`SelectCommandParser`. It implements the one operation:

* `CommandResult#execute()` -- Executes the selectCommand which returns the person selected to be displayed in the UI.

Other operations that were implemented to aid the `SelectCommand` feature are:

* `Model#selectPerson()` -- Returns the person that was stored.
* `Model#storePerson(Person)` -- Stores the person that was selected.
* `Logic#getPerson()` -- Retrieves the person that was selected to display their personal information in the UI.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#selectPerson()` and `Model#storePerson
(Person)` and in the Logic interface as `Logic#getPerson()`.

An example usage scenario is given below which elaborates how the select command works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `select 3` command to display the personal information of the 3rd person in the address
book. When the command is executed, the person selected at the specified index will be stored in ModelManager as
`selectedPerson` using the operation `Model#storePerson(Person)`.
//image

Step 2. After the command has been executed, the selected person is retrieved in the MainWindow class. It checks
whether a person has been selected and displays the selected person's personal information.
//snippet and image

The implementation was done this way because the Ui component interacts with both the Logic and Model component.
Firstly, the Ui component takes in the input from the user and allows the Logic component to parse the argument.
After the argument has been parsed, the person is stored in the Model component which houses most of the data of the
app. The Ui listens for any changes made to the Model data, and updates the Ui to display the selected person.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: In what way is the personal information of the selected person going to be displayed

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Displaying it in a feature box.
** Pros: Minimises the use of mouse and is in line with the other features that is utilizing the feature box.
** Cons: Aesthetic is not as good compared to the other alternatives.
* Alternative 2: Displaying it in a tab form.
** Pros: Looks more organised compared to the other alternatives
** Cons: Not as intuitive to use as mouse has to be used to switch around tabs.
* Alternative 3: Displaying via a pop-up.
** Pros: Looks neater and organised.
** Cons: Increase the use of mouse to close the window and may be distracting to user.

===== Aspect: How to select a person

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Choosing by the index number.
** Pros: Intuitive to use and can be used with other commands such as `FindCommand` and `FilterCommand` to narrow
down the list of people.
** Cons: Additional step of filtering before selecting a person.
* Alternative 2: Choosing by name.
** Pros: Can omit the filtering step and select the person directly.
** Cons: There may be 2 people with the same name and thus result in an error.

=== Undo / Redo feature
The undo command enables users to undo their previous commands while the redo feature enables users to redo their undone commands.

==== Undo Implementation

The undo feature is facilitated by the HistoryManager. The commands stack and the addressBooks stack in the HistoryManager class are used to govern the undo feature.

The static commands stack keeps track of all the commands that have been executed by the user while the static addressBooks stack keeps track of the corresponding state of the address book following the executed command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The HistoryManager will be initialised with the initial address book state pushed to the addressBook stack.

image::initialStack.png[width=450]

Step 2. The user executes the delete 3 command to delete the 3rd person in the Athletick list. The delete command will be pushed into the commands stack in and the new state of the address book (after executing the delete command) will be pushed to the addressBooks stack as well.

image::afterUndoStack.png[width=450]

Step 3. The user now decides that deleting the 3rd person in the list was a mistake, and decides to undo the action by executing the undo command. The undo command calls the undo method in the ModelManager which pops the latest Command from the commands stack and
the latest Address Book from the addressBooks stack. This removes the latest action caused by the command that wants to be undone. It then continues to peek at the addressBooks stack to retrieve the Address Book state before the undone Command was executed.

image::initialStack.png[width=450]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSQ.png[width=450]
Figure 1. Sequence diagram for undo feature

==== Redo Implementation

The redo feature is also facilitated by the HistoryManager. The undoneCommands stack and the undoneAddressBooks stack in the HistoryManager class are used to govern the redo feature.

The undoneCommands stack keeps track of commands that have been undone by the user while the undoneAddressBooks stack keeps track of the corresponding state of the address book following the undone command.

How the redo feature works is very similar to how to undo feature work. The difference is that redo utilises the undoneCommands stack and the undoneAddressBook stack. As such, you can also refer to the diagrams in the Undo Implementation.


==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of the undo and redo features.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves a deep copy of the entire address book after each command into a stack.
** Pros:  Easy to implement, and easy for developers to understand.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

====== Reason why we chose alternative 1:
Even though the memory usage of Alternative 2 is lesser, we do not feel that the benefit of the usage of lesser memory outweigh the cost of implementing the alternative.

Furthermore, as we realise that each time the application starts, the memory of the states of the address book in both alternatives are cleared.
This means that the cost of having alternative 1 is significantly cheaper. As such, we decided to go with the first alternative.


=== Adding/editing photo feature
==== Implementation
The sub feature of `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` allows the inclusion of photo for a person. The sub feature is
facilitated by `Photo`.

This sub feature is similar to the other features such as `Name` and `Phone` which has a prefix `i/` followed by the
file name (e.g. `i/default.png`). Prior to adding the photo of a person, the image file that is going to be used has to
be in the `\src\main\resources\images` directory. `Photo` takes in the file name as a `String` and retrieves the
photo to be added or edited from the directory that was mentioned previously.

*File name restriction*
The file name of the images is restricted to alphanumerics only and the file format that will be used is `.png`. This
is done to keep the file name simple.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Regular expression for the file name
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** To use alphanumerics only.
** Pros: Keeps it simple without the confusion of special characters.
** Cons:
* **Alternative 2:** Alphanumerics and special characters.
** Pros
** Cons

=== Filter feature

The filter command enables filtering of athletes based on their tags.
Currently, only filtering by one tag is supported.
Filtering by multiple tags will be available by `v1.2`.

==== Implementation

Filter makes use of a `TagMatchesPredicate` class to determine if the athlete has tags matching the user input.
Given below is the Sequence Diagram to show how filter works, with an example input of filter captain.

image::filter_sequence_diagram.png[]

Once filtering by multiple tags is implemented, the parsing of tag from `AddressBookParser` to `FilterCommandParser` will involve splitting them by spaces and storing the tag queries in a list.
Thereafter, each tag query will be compared against every athlete’s tags to determine if the athlete should be filtered.

However, since currently only filtering by one tag is supported,
the parsing of tag simply involves trimming the tag of white spaces.

Finally, the list shown to the user is updated through `Model#updateFilteredPersonsList()`.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How a tag match is determined

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive.
** Pros: More user-friendly.
** Cons: Requires converting tags to lower-case on the back-end.
* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive.
** Pros: Allows for more accurate filtering.
** Cons: Difficult for users to search, as generally filtering and searching are case-insensitive.

===== Aspect: How matches for multiple tags are determined

* **Alternative 1:** Exclusive matching.
** Pros: Allows for more accurate filtering.
** Cons: Users get fewer filter results.
* **Alternative 2:** Optional matching.
** Pros: Allows for more flexible searching.
** Cons: Users may get results that they are not interested in.

=== Sort Command

The sort command sorts the displayed list of athletes by alphabetical order. As new athletes are added to the bottom of the list, the sort command is used after to reorder the athlete list.

==== Implementation

The `sort` command makes use of a `PersonComparator` that orders athletes in alphabetical order by comparing their names. The comparison is case-insensitive.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `sort` Command
image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon completion of the above execution, the sorted list of athletes would be displayed immediately thorugh `Model#sortByName()`.

To support sorting by more parameters (e.g. by height / weight), you can simply create a new class that implements `Comparator` that compares athletes by that parameter instead. After which, you have to edit the `sort` command to support different sort command syntaxes.

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: When should the athlete list should be sorted
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort address book after user issues the `sort` command
** Pros: Users are able to view their newly added athletes at the bottom of the list which is more user-friendly especially when the list of athletes is very long. Allows future expansion to sort by other methods (e.g. performance scores) easily as we only have to create new comparators to order the athletes.
** Cons: Additional overhead required in terms of having to create an additional command for users to issue.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort address book persistently in alphabetical order
** Pros: Sorting is automated
** Cons: The list is unable to be sorted by other methods (e.g. attendance rate) unless we implement alternative 1 so the alternative 2 is more limited.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
