=== Add feature
==== Implementation

The `add` feature uses the Model to check if the dish is already in the database.
If the dish is already in the database, the meal will be added to the meal log only.
If the dish the user wants to add is not in the database,
then the dish will be added to both the meal log and the dish database so that the user
can conveniently add it the next time.

There are a few cases to take note:

* If the dish is in the dish database:
** The user inserts the calorie information that is the same as the one in the dish database
*** The dish will be added to the meal log only.

** The user inserts the calorie information different from the calorie in the dish database
*** This will create a new dish all together as there are differences in the calorie
*** The new dish will be added to both the meal log as well as the dish database

** The user does not insert the calorie information
*** The program will look through the dish database and get the calorie information from that dish.

* If the dish is not in the dish database
** The user inserts the calorie information
*** A new dish is created with that name and calorie information
*** The dish will then be added to both the dish database as well as the meal log.

** The user does not insert the calorie information
*** The program sets the calorie information to 700 by default.
*** The dish will then be added to both the dish database as well as the meal log

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` operation works when calorie information is included:

To detect whether the calorie tag is used in the user input, we use an UNKNOWN_CALORIE in the Calorie class.
This will trigger either search for the dish in the dish database or create a new dish and input it into the dish database.


The input by the user and the dish in the dish database is considered equal only if both the name and the calorie information are the same.

Addition of tags are supported. However, they are not crucial to the implementation of the add function as tags are not considered when deciding equality of dishes.
