== PROJECT: ExerHealth

== Overview

My team of 5 computer science students were tasked with changing a basic command line application. Our team
decided to morph the application into ExerHealth. **ExerHealth** is a desktop application used for tracking
and scheduling the user's exercises. The application contains statistical analysis of exercises that users have completed
in the past. Additionally, it also acts as a personal trainer by suggesting different exercises which both
beginners and advanced users can choose from to incorporate into their exercise regimes.
The user interacts with it using a command line interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Below is a screenshot of what our desktop application looks like:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to search for suggestions*
** What it does: The command `suggest` allows the user to search for suggestions.
** Justification: This feature gives new users a starting point in their exercise regime.
This feature also offers experienced users suggestions based on the type of exercises the user wishes to do.
** Highlights: This enhancement works well with existing features, such as Custom Properties, and can be expanded upon.
It requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives to ensure that future extensions or further enhancements can be smooth.
The implementation was also challenging as it required multiple new predicate and utility classes.

* *Minor enhancement 1*: Added the display panel on the left hand side of the UI to show the respective information after a command is executed (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-2/main/pull/121/files[#121]).

* *Minor enhancement 2*: Allowed the command box to be automatically focused on upon opening the application so that user does not need to click on the box to start typing (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-2/main/pull/128[#128]).
