    "description": "The essence of nanoworld, i.e. nanoscience and technology, is the ability to\nunderstand and manipulate matter at the atomic level. Structures and electronic\nand magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced\nto the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre =\n10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical,\noptical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size.\nThe nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the\ntraditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and\nengineering.\n\nTo understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance\nspectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray\nabsorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray\nphotoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy,\nangular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also\nintroduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy\n(AFM).\n\nThe aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and\ntechniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed\ninclude: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement\ntechniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects\nand devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating\nnanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the\nfuture? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are\ninterested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and\nnanotechnology.",
