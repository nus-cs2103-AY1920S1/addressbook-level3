    "description": "Situated within a megadiverse biodiversity-hotspot, Singapore has drastically-reduced natural areas yet remains surprisingly species-rich. Combined with her colonial legacy, infrastructural capabilities and cultural biases, Singapore offers a unique situation for studying biodiversity. In this module, we study how Singapore\u2019s biodiversity landscape as well as the motivations and methods for studying biodiversity have evolved across Singapore\u2019s history. Retracing how prominent naturalists explored Singapore\u2019s biodiversity in the past, we imagine how they would do it today using current techniques. This module has a strong fieldwork component, imbuing students with naturalist sensibilities which heightens their awareness of Singapore\u2019s diverse but oft-neglected natural heritage.",
