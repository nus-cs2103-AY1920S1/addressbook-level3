EzWatchlist was built with ease in mind hence our interface reflects this design philosophy.

.EzWatchlist's graphical interface
image::Ui.png[width="900"]

==== Navigation

EzWatchlist is split into four different pages:

. <<Watchlist Page, *Watchlist*>>, where shows you want to watch are added.
. <<Watched List, *Watchedlist*>>, where shows you have watched are located.
. <<Search Page, *Search*>>, where you search for shows both online and offline.
. <<Statistics Page, *Statistics*>>, where information about your viewing habits are shown.

This pages are represented by the <<Sidebar, *sidebar panel*>> shown visibly in Figure 1. Navigate between pages by using keyboard shortcuts kbd:[1], kbd:[2], kbd:[3], kbd:[4] respectively or
through a button press on the graphical interface.

==== Interaction
.EzWatchlist's command line interface.
image::commandline.png[width="900"]


EzWatchlist uses <<UserCommands, Commands>> entered through the command line interface in figure 2 to interact with the application.
Typing a command into the interface and entering it (by pressing kbd:[Enter] or clicking `_Go!_`) is the main way of interaction in the application.
The following is an example of adding a movie into your watch list:
