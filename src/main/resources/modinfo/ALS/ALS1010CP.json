    "description": "This module considers evidence-based techniques for learning derived from the fundamental science and understanding of how we learn. It reveals steps on the path to more effective learning by using a set of simple, pragmatic rules: rules to build motivation and to speed up the learning process over both the short and long term. Learners will appreciate learning rules and the scientific evidence behind them. They will also understand why, despite sometimes being counterintuitive, they work so well. This understanding will lead to individualised application of techniques to improve learning.",
