    "description": "This module is developed to introduce the rationale, principles and practical applications of pharmaceutical preformulation science in the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products.The importance of material attributes on product quality will be highlighted as final product quality can be related to raw materials. Topics to be covered will include rationale and principles of pharmaceutical preformulation studies, quality attributes of materials associated with common pharmaceutical unit operations and techniques for characterizing materials. Students will also be introduced to statistical methods relevant to preformulation/formulation (e.g. for screening, optimization and assessment of excipients and product quality).",
