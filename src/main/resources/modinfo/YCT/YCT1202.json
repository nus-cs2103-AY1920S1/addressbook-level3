    "description": "In a culturally and socially diverse society, discussion about issues of difference, conflict and community are needed to facilitate understanding between social/cultural groups. In this intergroup dialogue, students will actively participate in semi-structured, face-to-face meetings with students from other social identity groups. Students will learn from each other\u2019s' perspectives, read and discuss relevant reading material, and explore their own and other groups\u2019 experiences in various social and institutional contexts. Students will also explore ways of taking action to create change and bridge differences at the interpersonal and social/community levels.",
