    "description": "This course introduces students to the history, theory and practice of science communication at an advanced level. It covers contemporary competing theories of what constitutes 'best practice' in science communication, the historical roots of the discipline, fundamental practical skills for communicating science with the public, and a deep understanding of science communication professional practice. It provides a solid foundation for further studies in science communication, touching on multiple communication mediums, considerations of different aims and audiences, and some specifics of communicating particular kinds of scientific information. Students will develop foundational science communication research skills in this course. The course is compulsory for students in the Master of Science Communication and Master of Science Communication Outreach programs, but postgraduates in other disciplines, particularly in the sciences, can also benefit from its overview of the current science communication landscape. The course will be run as a combination of online content, face-to-face or online classes and an intensive component on-campus.",
