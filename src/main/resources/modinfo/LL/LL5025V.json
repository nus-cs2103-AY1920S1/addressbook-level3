    "description": "An advanced course in analytic jurisprudence, investigating the nature of rights. It begins with exposition of Wesley Hohfeld\u2019s analysis of the different legal positions often designated as 'rights'; then uses Hohfeld\u2019s framework to understand the debate between interest and will theorists of rights. It moves on to explicit consideration of moral rights. Finally, applications are considered \u2013 including human rights, and Asian perspectives on 'rights' discourse.",
