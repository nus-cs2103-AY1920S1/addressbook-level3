    "description": "This course examines how anthropologists address themes of gender and sexuality in South Asia through reading recent ethnographies. The course introduces students to varied ways that ideas about gender and sexuality, and social relations of gender are constructed, maintained, and challenged in South Asia. Issues to be explored include marriage, kinship and the body; religion and nationalism; masculinity studies; gender and violence; globalization and international gender development; globalization, education and work; sex work; queer activism and transgender identities. Emphasis is on India but other parts of the region are also considered (Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka). Films will supplement readings.",
