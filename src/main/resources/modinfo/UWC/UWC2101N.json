    "description": "The subject students will think, read, and write about in this module is clothing and identities. Do clothes make the man or woman? Most people accept that the clothes we wear say something about us? Particularly about our race, gender, class, and power status. But what do they say, exactly? How do they say this? Why have we learned to see clothes as speaking thus? Furthermore, if clothes say certain accepted things, what happens when people dress in inappropriate ways?",
