    "description": "Over the past 30 years, there has been an explosion in the amount of quantitative biological data. This is due to advances in imaging, genetics, and sequencing. This module introduces methods necessary for understanding and analysing such quantitative biological data. We use systems from across biology, from photosynthesis to human sleep cycles, to demonstrate the power and applicability of these approaches. We introduce the mathematical and physical concepts necessary through the course. Thismodule is suitable for all Life Sciences students regardless of background in the physical sciences.",
