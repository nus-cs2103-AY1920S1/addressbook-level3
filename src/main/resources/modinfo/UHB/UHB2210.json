    "description": "The ability to experience emotions has numerous consequences, both desirable and undesirable, as emotions can colour our perception, drive or deter our daily pursuits, and, in the long run, shape whether we feel satisfied or disgruntled with life. This module focuses on the roles that emotions play in various areas of life, such as arts, religion, and material consumption. There will be multi-disciplinary, reflective discussions, grounded on updated and rigorous psychological research so as to enhance appreciation of abstract theories and to motivate effective application of these theories in real life.",
