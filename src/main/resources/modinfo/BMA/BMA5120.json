    "description": "As emerging markets are dynamically altering the economy, it\u2019s important for us to study only the most recent information available to us, in the form of newly published case studies to look at how international and domestic firms operate in emerging markets and what new opportunities are being created to circumvent institutional voids in these growth markets. Guest speakers will be industry experts directly related to the cases being discussed in class, panel discussions will be arranged for more direct interaction for students with industry. The final group project will capture the essence of the key learnings. To incorporate all the additional learnings and extensive industry engagement, this course will carry 4 MC and be taught over the full semester.",
