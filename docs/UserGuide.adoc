== Introduction

CS ModBuddy is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for planning their modules*.
More importantly, CS ModBuddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CS ModBuddy can get your module planning done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `csmodbuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your module plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will display instructions for all commands.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

Example:

* `addsem y5s1`

==== Removing a semester from a study plan: `removesem`
Deletes all the modules in the specified semester in the current active study plan, after which that
semester will contain no modules. If the semester to be deleted is a _mainstream semester_  (i.e. not a special term
or a Year 5 semester), an empty semester will remain on the GUI. If the semester is a _non-mainstream semester_,
e.g. Y1ST1, the whole semester will disappear from the current study plan. +

//tag::validmods[]
==== Viewing modules that can be taken in a given semester : `validmods`
Shows all the modules that can be taken in a given semester, based only on whether its prerequisites have been met.

[NOTE]
This semester need not necessarily exist in the module planner for you to view its valid modules.
Moreover, certain modules such as the internship and dissertation may show up in early semesters,
because their prerequisites are not expressible in terms of prerequisite modules.

Format: `validmods SEMESTER`

Example:

* `validmods y2s1`
//end::validmods[]

// tag::datatwo[]

=== Tagging

[IMPORTANT]
All tag names must be single words and cannot be more than 25 characters long.

==== Viewing default tags : `viewdefaulttags`
Shows all default tag types.

Format: `viewdefaulttags`

====
List of default tags:

- `Completed` :
_Completed_ modules are modules that are in any semester before the *current semester*.

- `Core` :
_Core_ modules are *Computer Science Foundation* modules that count towards *Programme Requirements*.

- `S/U-able` :
_S/U-able_ modules are modules that permit the *Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory option*.

- `UE [coming in v2.0]`:
_UE_ modules are *Unrestricted Elective* modules.

- `ULR [coming in v2.0]`:
_ULR_ modules are modules that count towards *University Level Requirements*.

- `FOCUS_AREA_NAME:P` :
_P_ modules are modules that count towards Focus Area Primaries for _FOCUS_AREA_NAME_.

- `FOCUS_AREA_NAME:E` :
_E_ modules are modules that count towards Focus Area Electives for _FOCUS_AREA_NAME_.
====

==== Tagging modules : `addtag`
Attaches a tag to a module. +
Format: `addtag MODULE_CODE TAG_NAME`

[TIP]
If a tag with the given `TAG_NAME` does not exist, a new tag will automatically be created and tagged to the specified module.

Example:

* `addtag cs3230 exchange` +
Attaches the tag with name _exchange_ to _CS3230_.

==== Deleting tags: `deletetag`
Deletes a tag completely and removes it from any module that it is attached to. +
Format: `deletetag TAG_NAME`

[NOTE]
Only user-created tags can be deleted, i.e. default tag cannot be deleted.

Example:

* `deletetag exchange`

==== Removing a tag from a module: `removetag`
Removes a tag from a module. +
Format: `removetag MODULE_CODE TAG_NAME`

Example:

=== Study Plan

==== Creating a new study plan: `newplan`
Creates a new study plan with an optional title. The title should contain only ASCII characters, and should not be
longer than 20 characters.

[NOTE]
Each study plan is assigned a unique ID upon its creation. This ID will remain the same throughout
the life of the study plan. The ID will be reset to 1 when all study plans are deleted and the application is restarted.

Format: `newplan [TITLE]` +
Examples:

* `newplan`

==== Checking a study plan's feasibility : `check`
Shows details about what graduation requirements are left to be fulfilled,
such as MCs, core or focus area modules that remain to be taken.

[NOTE]
This command will not check for the minimum number of MCs to be taken per semester,
as additional modules that students may take (such as UEs or ULRs) are outside the scope of our project.

Format: `check [AREA]`

Examples

* `check mcs`
* `check core`
* `check focus`
* `check`

// end::check[]

// tag::clearinvalidmods[]
==== Clear all currently invalid modules : `clearinvalidmods`
Clears all modules that are currently invalid, whose prerequisites have not been met in previous semesters.
This may cause other modules in future semesters to be invalidated as well. +
Format: `clearinvalidmods`
// end::clearinvalidmods[]

// tag::versiontracking[]
=== Version Tracking

==== Committing edits to a study plan: `commit`
Saves changes to a study plan with a short commit message.

[NOTE]
Even without committing, the module planner is automatically saved to storage after every command is
executed successfully. However, commits allow the user to revert to a previous state of the study plan.

[TIP]
The user is allowed, but not recommended, to commit a study plan even when there are no changes
since the previous commit.

Format: `commit SHORT_MESSAGE` +
Examples:

* `commit planned until y2s2`
* `commit haven’t added UEs`

==== Checking commit history: `history`
Shows all commit history of the current study plan. +
Format: `history`

==== Viewing a commit: `viewcommit`
Shows the version of the current study plan for a particular commit. This does not create a new commit, nor does it
return the study plan to a previous version. The commit will be displayed as a simplified study plan. +

Format: `viewcommit COMMIT_NUMBER` +
Example:

* `viewcommit 1.1` +
This allows the user to view commit 1 of study plan 1 (which is currently active).

==== Reverting to a commit: `revert`
Reverts to the version of the current study plan for a particular commit. This creates a new "Revert to" commit and
returns the current active study plan back to the state in the specified commit.

[TIP]
The user is allowed, but not recommended, to revert to another "Revert to" commit. This will create a
long chain of "Revert to Revert to ..." commit messages.

Format: `revert COMMIT_NUMBER` +
Example:

* `revert 1.1` +
Suppose there are commits `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, and `1.3`. This allows the user to revert to commit 1 of study plan 1,
creating a new commit called `1.4: Revert to "COMMIT_MESSAGE_OF_1.1"`.

==== Removing a commit: `removecommit`
Removes a commit in the current active study plan specified by the commit number. +
Format: `removecommit COMMIT_NUMBER` +
Example:

* `removecommit 2.2`

// end::versiontracking[]

// tag::gui[]
