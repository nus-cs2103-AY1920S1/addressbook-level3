    "description": "This module explores how the computer can be used as a medium for expression. Just as it is essential to be literate in the traditional sense, it is increasingly important to be literate (able to read and write) in computational media, such as webpages, social media, smartphone apps, computer games, etc. Through a balance of theory and practice, this interdisciplinary module exposes students to the history and principles behind computation. Students learn, through hands-on exercises, the ways that computation underpins key aspects of modern life, such as the internet, mediated communication, business and commerce, science and technology, and the arts.",
