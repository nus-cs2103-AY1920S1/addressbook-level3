    "description": "The module will be organised around the following four topics. First, the vision of agriculture found in early development thought; second the structural transformations of agriculture in the twentieth century in terms of production and trade; third, an examination of states that have resisted the globalising tide in order to determine whether their domestic policies qualify as 'development'; and finally the possibility of decoupling development and globalisation.",
