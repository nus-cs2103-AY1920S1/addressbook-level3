== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FlashcardListParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Flashcard).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
// end::logic[]

// tag::model[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Flashcard List data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* also exposes a statistics object to the ui to create the statistic charts .
// end::model[]


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/flashcard/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Flashcard data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.flashcard.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::quizdiagram[]

=== Quiz and Flip feature
In the flashcard system, quiz and flip is a special function that can help the user quiz themselves on the flashcards and see
there own improvements. The flip command, which is answering the quizzed flashcard, can only be used when a current flashcard is being quizzed.
The following sequence diagram shows how the quiz and flip diagram works.

.Component interactions for quiz command on a single flashcard
image::QuizSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Stats feature

After a series of quizzes, each flashcard can automatically record how many correct answers and wrong answers has the user did on this flashcard.
The stats command helps the user to see their progress while doing the quizzes. Below is a sequence diagram of how this command
works.

.Component interactions for stats command
image::StatsSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::quizdiagram[]

// tag::quiztagfeature[]
=== Quiz Tag feature
Alternatively, users can choose to quiz a series of tags instead of a single card.
A list of flashcards will then be added to the list of quizable cards,
which also triggers quiz mode, allowing users to use the flip command to answer flashcards consecutively.
The following sequence diagram shows how the quiztag command works:

.Component interactions for any quiztag command
image::QuizTagSequenceDiagram.png[]

Calling a quiztag command triggers the quiz mode, which is stored as a boolean in the FlashcardListParser.
This is done with the consideration that there are different functions that can start the quiz mode (i.e quiz, quiztag),
and others that can end the quiz mode (i.e flip, end, exit).

During quiz mode, the flip command can be called consecutively for as long as there are flashcards left in the quiz, as shown below:

.Flip command running and interact with the parser to toggle quiz mode
image::FlipSequenceDiagram.png[]

The flip command interacts with the model to check if there are any quizable flashcards.
If there are none, the flip command toggles the quiz mode in FlashcardListParser off.

// end::quiztagfeature[]

// tag::undoredo[]

===  Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFlashcardList`.
It extends `FlashcardList` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `flashcardListStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFlashcardList#commit()` -- Saves the current flashcard list state in its history.
* `VersionedFlashcardList#undo()` -- Restores the previous flashcard list state from its history.
* `VersionedFlashcardList#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone flashcard list state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFlashcardList()`, `Model#undoFlashcardList()` and `Model#redoFlashcardList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFlashcardList` will be initialized with the initial flashcard list state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single flashcard list state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th Flashcard in the flashcard list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitFlashcardList()`, causing the modified state of the flashcard list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `flashcardListStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted flashcard list state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add q/What is a machine ...` to add a new Flashcard. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitFlashcardList()`, causing another modified flashcard list state to be saved into the `flashcardListStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFlashcardList()`, so the flashcard list state will not be saved into the `flashcardListStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the flashcard was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFlashcardList()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous flashcard list state, and restores the flashcard list to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial flashcard list state, then there are no previous flashcard list states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFlashcardList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoFlashcardList()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the flashcard list to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `flashcardListStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest flashcard list state, then there are no undone flashcard list states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFlashcardList()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the flashcard list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitFlashcardList()`, `Model#undoFlashcardList()` or `Model#redoFlashcardList()`. Thus, the `flashcardListStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire flashcard list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the flashcard being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. There will be a lot coding involved and a higher chance of regression bugs.
// end::undoredo[]

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of flashcard list states.
** Pros: It has a very clear structure and is therefore easy for future developers to update.
** Cons: It might be difficult to navigate between different elements in the list. However, that's not really a big issue as we only need to move to neighbouring states each time.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::quizmodedc[]
===== Aspect: Quiz Mode
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A static boolean is stored in the FlashcardListParser to indicate whether the application
is currently in quiz mode. Being in quiz mode allows access to some commands and disables others.
** Pros: It is easy to toggle Quiz mode on and off from the various commands as it is a static boolean and can be accessed easily.
** Cons: It violates the Single Responsibility Principle as the parser now stores information vital to the logic of the application, besides parsing arguments.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the Quiz mode boolean inside Logic Manager.
** Pros: It adheres better to software engineering principles as variables affect the logic of the programme should be stored in the logic manager.
** Cons: As Quiz mode heavily affects the parsing of the commands, the boolean has to be passed to and fro several layers, making it harder for commands to toggle quiz mode on and off.
// end::quizmodedc[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 flashcards without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

.  If the stored flashcard list is very long, all commands should still be executed at a fast speed, with minimal sluggishness.
.  Should be able to minimize loss of stored flashcard information if the app closes due to unforeseen external circumstances.
.  Command format should be easily understandable and intuitive to make it easier then using a GUI interface

[appendix]
== Glossary

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

[[flashcard]] Flashcard::
A digital card that contains a short piece of information like an English word or a geography common knowledge. Normally used by people to facilitate the memorization process.

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a flashcard

. Deleting a flashcard  while all flashcards (in a tagged set/in the all-flashcard list) are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all flashcards using the `list` command. Multiple flashcards in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First flashcard with ID 1 is deleted from the list.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No flashcard is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size or ID number is negative)
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Manually make a Json file with invalid fields and see if FlashMind can identify these issues or not.
