== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a list of `Schedule`. Each `Schedule` represents a schedule timetable.
* exposes a list of `ObservableList<ObservableList<String>>` that can be 'observed' by the UI. Each of the
  `ObservableList<ObservableList<String>>` represents the data of a `Schedule` object.
  The `ObservableList<ObservableList<String>>` objects are bound to the UI so that the UI automatically updates  when the data of the `Schedule` objects changes.
* exposes a list of `ObservableList<Interviewee>` that can be 'observed' by the UI.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Schedule
The `Schedule` objects are filled up and created by the imported interviewer's availability. The inner data of a `Schedule` object is the same as the corresponding availability
table in the imported interviewer's availability. The data of the `Schedule` can be changed after running the scheduling algorithm.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== [Coming soon in v1.3] Scheduling Algorithm
The scheduling of interviews is essentially a https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-bipartite-matching/[maximum bipartite matching problem].
The application is trying to find the **maximum number of matching** between available interview slots
and interviewees.

In this application, the selected algorithm is https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hopcroft-karp-algorithm-for-maximum-matching-set-1-introduction/[hopcroft-karp algorithm].
The complexity of the algorithm is o(√v x e), which is reasonably fast. The relevant details of the algorithm are as below:

**Vertex**

**Edge**

**Matching Criteria** +
An interviewee matches an interview slot if **all** the criteria below are fulfilled:

. The timing of the slot matches one of the available timings of the interviewee.
. The department of the time slot matches the department of choice of the interviewee.

**Brief Explanation of the Algorithm** +
Include an **activity diagram** here to summarise the algorithm.


The proposed implementation of this algorithm is to encapsulate the logic of the algorithm into a `Command` class under
`Logic` component, possibly with the help of some auxiliary classes. The command is then invoked when the user key in the relevant
command keyword (refer user guide).

When the scheduling algorithm has finished running, it will update the data in the `Schedule` objects to reflect the
allocated time slots to the interviewees, which the changes will then be reflected automatically in the UI.


=== Display Schedule Feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The display schedule feature extends Scheduler to display multiple tables of schedule per day. It is a component in the "MainWindow" class
stored in a "ScheduleViewPanel" class. Within the "ScheduleViewPanel" class, objects of "ScheduleView" class are stored into the panel.

ScheduleViewPanel implements the following function:
*`fillPanel()` -- Fill the ScheduleView component with the schedule tables for each day.

Given below is an example scenario of what will be displayed to the user.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The Ui will start and the MainWindow will be displayed first.

Step 2. MainWindow will call all the children such as the HelpWindow, CommandBox, Result Display, StatusBarFooter and ScheduleViewPanel.

Step 3. Once ScheduleViewPanel is called, it will take in a list of titles and ObservableList data from the Logic class. The list of titles
consist of the title column for each schedule table and the ObservableList data consists of the time slots allocated to each interviewee.

Step 4. ScheduleViewPanel will call the ScheduleView class to fill each table and populate each table with the data given by the Logic class.

Step 5. ScheduleView will have a .fxml file of a table and it will first be filled with the column titles, followed by the time slots and the
interviewee allocated to each time slots. The slot that has no interviewee will be displayed as "0".

Step 6. Once the data is populated, the MainWindow will display the schedules of each day arranged in a table format.

Step 7. Once User imports a new .csv file, it will call the RefreshListener Interface. RefreshListenerManager will then take in the new titles and
list of ObservableList of interviewee.

Step 8. The RefreshListenerManager will call the MainWindow to refresh the ScheduleViewPanel.

Step 9. ScheduleViewPanel will firstly clear all the data and input the updated data from the .csv file.

=== Import
==== Implementation

The import feature uses `CsvReader` in the Model to read the given .csv file and stores the data into the model.

* `import interviewer <csv file>` stores the read data as a list of `Schedule` objects in the model.
* `import interviewee <csv file>` stores the read data as a list of `Interviewee` objects in the model.
* `CsvReader` makes use of `BufferedReader` to read data from the given file.

image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[]
Given above is an example of a sequence diagram for importing interviewer's schedules. It applies to both importing interviewee's and interviewer's data.

As seen in the above sequence diagram, the execution of the import feature consists of these steps:

* Step 1: `LogicManager` will start executing the command by parsing it over to `AddressBookParser`.
* Step 2: `AddressBookParser` will then look and initialise an `ImportCommand` instance and return it to `LogicManager`.
* Step 3: `LogicManager` will then call execute() on the returned `ImportCommand`  object.
* Step 4: During the execute() method, the method will initialise a `CsvReader` object to `read()` data from the the given .csv file.
* Step 5: The read data will then be stored as either `scheduleList` or `intervieweeList` in the model.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::ImportActivityDiagram.png[]


=== [Coming soon in v1.3] Export
==== Implementation [Proposed]
The Export command gets the scheduled time slots from the Model and writes them in the specified .csv file.
CsvWriter facilitates the writing to the specified file.

* CsvWriter makes use of `BufferedWriter` to write data into the specified file.

Below shows the sequence diagram of an example export command.

image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

The implementation is very similar to the Import feature. The only differences are in the Model where CsvWriter gets
the scheduled time slots from the Model and proceeds to write it into the specified file using a `BufferedWriter`.

The Activity Diagram below summarises the execution of the export command.

image::ExportActivityDiagram.png[]


// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

=== [Coming soon in v1.3] Email
==== Implementation

The Email feature makes use of the `java.awt.Desktop` package to activate the default Mail client of the user.

* The `To:` field is automatically populated with all the emails that are tagged to a particular Interviewee.
* The `Cc:` field is configurable by the user via an optional configuration file.
* The subject and message body are also automatically populated with details that are relevant to the Interviewee, depending on the context of the command used.

image::EmailSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Example: Interview timeslot

This is for sending the email to the Interviewee of his/her allocated interview timeslot. Details that vary according to the Interviewee include:

* Date and time of allocated timeslot
* Interviewer allocated

Additional details that can be configured by the user include:

* Location to report
* Dress code
* Any other additional information

The message content can also be configured by the user. However, a default template will be used when no such configuration file exists or is provided.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*
* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[Implementation-Configuration]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
