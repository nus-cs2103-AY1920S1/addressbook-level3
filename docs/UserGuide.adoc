== Introduction

NUSpend is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expenses*. More importantly, NUSpend is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUSpend can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `NUSpend.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your NUSpend.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all expenses
* **`add`**`d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 t/15-09-2019 1230 c/Food` : adds an expense named `Chicken Rice` to the expense tracker.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd expense shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

* Items in square brackets are optional
  e.g `p/PRICE [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as`d/Chicken Rice /p2.50 c/Food` or as `d/Chicken Rice /p2.50`
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY]...` can be used as `[blank]` (i.e. 0 times), `c/Food`, `c/Food c/Tasty`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. `add p/PRICE d/DESCRIPTION`, `add d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE` are both acceptable.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Basic Expense-Related Commands
==== Adding an expense: `add`

Add an expense to the expense tracker
Format: `add d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE [t/time] [c/CATEGORY]...`

[TIP]

Examples:

* `add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 t/15-09-2019 1230 c/Food`
* `add d/Buffet p/250 c/Food c/Anniversary Expense`

===== Using relative time/date input: `yesterday`

The user can specify an expense’s time using relative dates and times.

Example:

=== Reminders
==== Recording important dates : `remind`
Records an important date, which the expense tracker will remind you of as the date approaches.

Format: `remind EVENT DATE [n DAYS]`
Records the EVENT with the timestamp DATE.

By default, the expense tracker will remind you of this event when its scheduled time approaches 7 days and below. If the optional parameter `[n DAYS]` is inputted, the tracker will begin reminding you `n` days before the scheduled time.

=== Saving the data
Expense tracker data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

=== Viewing Statistics
==== Summary : `stats`
Produces statistics regarding the user’s expenses.

The statistics include all categories of items, with the number of entries, the total amount spent and the percentage composition of the total expenditure.

Format: `stats [start/START_DATE] [end/END_DATE]`
[where dates are in DD-MM-YYYY format]

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, statistics is calculated from one month after `START_DATE`(or part thereoff)

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, statistics is calculated from one month before `START_DATE`(or part thereoff)

Example:
`stats`
`stats end/12-12-2018`
`stats start/11-11-2018 end/12-12-2018`

==== Compare : `statscompare`
Produces and displays statistics regarding the user’s finance for 2 time periods. The statistics include all categories of items, the number of entries and the total amount spent and the percentage composition of the total, stated as a difference using second period – first period

Format: `statscompare start1/START_DATE_1 end1/END_DATE start2/START_DATE_2 end2/END_DATE_2`

- Support similar constraints like basic stats command for 1 period

- If only 1 valid period is given, then the functionality is similar to `stats START_DATE END_DATE`

Examples:
`statscompare start1/01-01-2019 end1/01-02-2019 start2/01-01-2019 end2/01-02-2019`

==== Visualize: `visual`
Generates pie chart for spending in different categories. The pie chart also shows the percentage composition of the total expenditure in text.

Format: `visual [start/START_DATE] [end/END_DATE]`
[where dates are in dd-MM-yyyy format]

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, statistics is calculated from one month after `START_DATE`(or part thereoff)

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, statistics is calculated from one month before `START_DATE`(or part thereoff)

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics is calculated from the start of this month till today.

Example:
`visual`
`visual end/12-12-2018`
`visual start/11-11-2018 end/12-12-2018`
