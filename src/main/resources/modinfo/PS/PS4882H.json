Topics to be covered include food production safety, labelling, and nutrition; environmental concerns relating to energy consumption and waste disposal; the politics of fast food; organic farming and sustainable agriculture; genetically modified foods; the ethics of animal care; vegetarianism, and the politics of hunger and malnutrition.",
