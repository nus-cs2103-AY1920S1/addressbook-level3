    "description": "Aristocrats, bureaucrats and tycoons are just some of the different players that have occupied elite positions in Southeast Asian societies. This module looks at these and other elite groups in terms of the roles they have played and how they have acquired, maintained or lost elite status. Why, for example, is the military an elite group in some countries but not others? Do wealthy people inevitably hold political power? The module also investigates the effects of various types of elite rule on politics, economic growth and social justice.",
