    "description": "This module explores globalisation and its impacts on urban identities, places and politics. Global processes connect cities and shape urbanisation and urban life. Yet, not all urban dwellers are affected the same way by these processes. Furthermore, cities and people respond to, and may even be actively involved in, the shaping of these global flows and processes. In this module, attention is paid to the webs of relations at different scales, from the global to the local, and even those at the micro scale, such as intimate relations, to consider their implications for the remaking of cities and urban social life.",
