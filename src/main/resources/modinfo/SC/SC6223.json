    "description": "This module provides graduate students with an opportunity to engage with current anthropological and sociological approaches to the government of life in contemporary capitalism. We will look at how researchers have employed concepts such as governmentality, biopolitics, neoliberalism and multi-culturalism to generate critical understandings of contemporary political conditions. More importantly, we wil situate these works within a broader history of efforts in the human sciences to understand the relation of power and truth, and its implications for human life.",
