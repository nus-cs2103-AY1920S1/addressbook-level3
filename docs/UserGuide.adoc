== Introduction
This user guide serves to assist you in the navigation and utilization of our application, *DeliveryMANS*.

*DeliveryMANS* is a command-line application designed specifically for delivery centre administrators who are in charge of food delivery service. It encompasses a well-structured system for users to keep track and manage the entire delivery process. It facilitates food delivery service by coaliasing the delivery men, customers and restaurant menu. From auto-assigning deliverymen for deliveries when orders are made, to viewing statistics of the most popular dish of restaurants as well as customer ordering trends for further promotions, financial and business management decisions, *DeliveryMANS* is everything you need to help improve managing deliveries. With just a few simple commands, this delivery manager can help to kickstart your delivery service.

Get started with <<Quick Start>> and begin managing your deliveries today!

== Commands

This section covers the list of commands which you can enter into our application.

**Command Types**

* In *DeliveryMANS*, there are 2 types of commands: universal commands and context-specific commands.
* Universal commands can be called under any context in the application.
* Context-specific commands can only be accessed in a specific context. Context-specific commands comprise customer,
restaurant and deliverymen commands, which can only be called under the customer, restaurant and deliverymen context
respectively.


**Command Format**

* Command words for universal commands are prepended with "-"
** Example Usage: `-help`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `-add_order c/CUSTOMER r/RESTAURANT f/FOOD q/QUANTITY`,
`CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `FOOD` and `QUANTITY` are parameters to be supplied.
** Example Usage: `-add_order c/Donald Trump r/KFC f/Chicken Bucket q/100`

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times e.g. `f/FOOD...` can be used 1 or more:
** Example Usage: `f/3 Piece Chicken Meal` or `f/Pepperoni Pizza f/Char Kway Teow`

* Items with `[]` are optional and can be omitted e.g. `[t/TAG]...`

{nbsp} +

// end::order[]
// tag::undoRedo[]

==== Undoing a command: `-undo`
This command undoes the effects of a command that you have previously executed.

Format: `-undo`

Say you have accidentally executed a command and now want to reverse it. Just type `-undo` into the
command line and press *Enter* like any other command. The result box will then show the following:

_Successfully undid: (your previous command here)_

The command which you last performed has now been reversed. Subsequent invocations of `-undo` will
reverse commands which you have performed even earlier.

The following is a step-by-step illustration of this process. Say you have just executed `delete 1`
to delete Alex Yeoh from the customer list, and now realise that it was a mistake! In the image
below, the result box confirms that Alex has been deleted, and his details are no longer in the
customer list.

image::userguide/UndoExample1.png[]

To undo this deletion, just type `-undo` into the program as shown and press *Enter*.

image::userguide/UndoExample2.png[]

Success! The result box displays the undone command, and Alex is back in the customer list.

image::userguide/UndoExample3.png[]

{nbsp} +

==== Redoing a command: `-redo`
This command redoes the effects of a command that you have just undone, in effect undoing an undo.
Similarly to `-undo`, this command can be used multiple times in succession to bring back multiple
commands which you have undone earlier.

Format: `-redo`

After performing `-redo`, the result box will show:

_Successfully redid: (your previous command here)_

The operation of this command is similar to the `-undo` command which is illustrated above.

{nbsp} +

==== Listing of undo/redo actions: `-undo_list`
This command lists the actions that can be undone and redone so that multiple actions can be redone
at once with the `-undo_till` command.

Format: `-undo_list`

Upon executing the command, the result box will show something similar to the following:

_Here are the actions that can be undone or redone, use -undo_till INDEX to undo or redo till that
action._

_1: (Undo) (command you previously executed here)_

_3: (Redo) (command you previously undid here)_

(Undo) indicates that the command was performed, and its effects can be undone. (Redo) indicates
that the command has previously been undone, and can now be redone. After using this command, take
note of the index of the command that you want to undo (or redo) until, and use the command
`-undo_till INDEX` to perform the undo or redo.

[NOTE]
The undo list can be seen as a timeline of commands; it is not possible to undo only certain
commands and not the other intervening commands.

Say you have undone two commands and decided that you actually want both of the commands redone.
First type `-undo_list` in the area indicated below by the red rectangle and press *Enter*.

image::userguide/UndoList1.png[]

The list of commands that can be undone or redone is then listed. In the image below, there
are two commands that can be redone. To redo _till_ the last command, take note of the index of the
last command, which is 3.

image::userguide/UndoList2.png[]

Now execute `-undo_till 3`. This command will be explained in more detail in the following section.

{nbsp} +

==== Undoing or redoing commands till a specific command: `-undo_till`
This command undoes or redoes all commands from the current state until after a specific command.
It takes in one parameter, INDEX, which is the index of the specific command. This index is obtained
from the command described in the previous section, `-undo_list`.

Format: `-undo_till INDEX`

Example: `-undo_till 3`

[NOTE]
====
.Requirement
The index provided must be a valid index obtained from `-undo_list`.
====

From the previous section, the index of the command to redo till is 3. Type `-undo_till 3` in the
app and press *Enter*. From the result box in the image below, it can be deduced that the first
order was assigned a deliveryman and marked as completed, but these two commands were then undone.
The image also shows that the deliveryman is now unassigned and the order is now shown as not
delivered.

image::userguide/UndoTill1.png[]

Upon successful execution, the result box shows whether commands were undone or redone, and the
specific command that has been undone or redone until. Also, the first order now has the deliveryman
reassigned and delivery marked as completed!

image::userguide/UndoTill2.png[]

{nbsp} +

// end::undoRedo[]
// tag::universalCommand2[]

==== Exiting the program: `-exit`
This command exits the program.

Format: `-exit`

// end::universalCommand2[]
