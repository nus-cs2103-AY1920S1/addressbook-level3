    "description": "What is education and who is it for? What should education do, and how do we achieve this ideal? How does education relate to society as a whole? Do educational systems reproduce inequality? Is education a tool for social control? These are some of the questions that this course will address. Students will collaborate on original ethnographic research projects. Readings will span Marxian, feminist, and postcolonial critique; social history; and ethnographies of education in different parts of the world. Topics include the formation of classes, the discourse of diversity, the meaning of merit, and the marketization of higher ed.",
