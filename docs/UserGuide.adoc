== Introduction
Due to vastly different timetables, scheduling interviews that don't clash for applicants to positions in an NUS
Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) during peak recruitment period can be difficult. Scheduler is an app that can automate this scheduling of interviews for
secretaries in NUS CCAs. Given templates adapted from exported NUSync CCA sign-up lists, Scheduler generates an optimal
matching of interviewees to time slots. Scheduler also supports manual input. It is optimised for people who **prefer
typing in a Command Line Interface (CLI)** to quickly access the functionalities of an app. +

Click on <<Quick Start, Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start
This guide shows you how to import your interviewee and interviewer schedules into Scheduler to begin managing your interview schedule.
It also shows you basic tips on how to add or delete and edit interviewers/interviewees based on your changing needs.

=== Import your csv file into the application
To begin, let's download some comma-separated value (.csv) files with dummy data and import that data into Scheduler.

Click <<Importing existing availabilities `import`, this link>> to download and import a .csv file of availabilities into Scheduler!

// tag::quickstart_add[]

=== Manually add interviewees and interviewers
Forgot to include some data before importing? No problem!

To add an interviewee, use the `add` command. Here we add an interviewee with the following characteristics:

. *Name* - John Doe
. *Phone number* - 91234567
. *Faculty* - School of Computing
. *Year of study* - 2019
. *Department of interest* - Marketing
. *Personal Email* - john_doe@gmail.com
. *Work email* (should be an NUS email) - john_doe@u.nus.edu
. *Preferred time slots* - 17/10/2019, 1pm to 2pm

 add r/interviewee n/John Doe p/91234567 f/School of Computing y/2019 ep/john_doe@gmail.com ew/john_doe@u.nus.edu d/Marketing s/17/10/2019 13:00-14:00

* Note that all fields specified above are *compulsory* when adding an interviewee manually.
* Please also note that the added interviewee cannot be already present in the application data, ie. no duplicates are allowed.

Similarly, to add an interviewer with the characteristics:

. *Name* - Bohn Coe
. *Phone number* - 9765421
. *Work email* (should be an NUS email) - bohn_coe@u.nus.edu
. *Department* - Marketing
. *Available time slots* - 17/10/2019, 1pm to 2pm

 add r/interviewer n/Bohn Coe p/97654321 ew/bohn_coe@u.nus.edu d/Marketing s/17/10/2019 13:00-14:00

* Again, the fields specified above are *compulsory when adding an interviewer manually.
* Please also note that the added interviewer cannot be already present in the application data, ie. no duplicates are allowed.

== User Preferences
Scheduler is initialised with default user preferences.

If you wish to make changes to the user preferences, do the following steps: +

* Step 1: Run scheduler.jar at least once. You should notice new files added to the folder containing the application.
* Step 2: Open preferences.json using any word editor, eg. notepad.
* Step 3: Edit the relevant user preference fields.

The details of each user preference field is explained further in the following sections.

=== Working Hours
Each time slot that an interviewer or interviewee indicates, must be within the `startTime` and `endTime` of the pre-defined
working hours for it to be displayed in the schedules.

*Format:* +
`startTime` and `endTime` are defined as strings. It has to follow the string format "HH:mm".

*Default values:* +
`startTime`: "10:00" +
`endTime`: "21:00"

=== Duration of Timeslot
Each time slot that an interviewer or interviewee indicates, must be strictly of this pre-defined duration for it to be
 displayed in the schedules. This duration will also determine the number of timeslots daily, each with the indicated duration, from the `startTime` to `endTime` of pre-defined <<Working Hours, Working Hours>>.
*It is represented by `duration` in the user preference file.*

*Format:* +
`duration` is defined as a positive integer representing the number of minutes of each time slot.

*Default values:* +
`duration`: 30

WARNING: When adding interviewees or interviewers manually into Scheduler, the `TIMESLOT` input provided must have a duration (in minutes) that matches `duration`.
In addition, the `TIMESLOT` indicated must also strictly follow the start and end times of each time slot. Refer to the example below for a clearer idea.

Example:

User preference:

 startTime: "10:00"
 endTime: "21:00"
 duration: 30

Result:

 Timeslots generated:
 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, .... , 20:00-20:30, 20:30-21:00
 //Timeslots are 30min intervals from 10:00 (startTime) to 21:00 (endTime)

As seen in the example above, each timeslot are 30min intervals from the start and end times of the Working Hours (10:00 to 21:00).
The indicated timeslots for interviewer/interviewee has to be one of these timeslots, e.g. 10:30-11:00, and *cannot be* any other values, e.g. 10:40-11:05.
*Failure to do so will result in an inaccurate display of schedules.*

=== Viewing help `help`
Shows helpful information on using this software.
Format: `help`

=== Importing existing availabilities `import`
The to-be-imported interviewer availability and interviewee details .csv file needs to follow the format as the templates below.
The templates for the import commands can be found here:

* Interviewer availability: http://bit.ly/interviewerTemplate
* Interviewees details: http://bit.ly/intervieweeDetails

TIP: If you wish to import a new set of data of the same type, we strongly recommend that you use the <<Clear, Clear>> command to clear pre-existing data before re-importing newer data.
This is because Scheduler does not allow duplicate persons, for both interviewer and interviewee. Unless you are very certain that the
the second import does not contain any duplicate data, we would suggest that you run the 'clear' command beforehand.

Constraints:

* Data in .csv file must follow the settings defined in the user preference file. View <<User Preferences, User Preferences>> if you wish to change the
default settings.
* Data to be imported should only be in English and should strictly follow the format of the templates given above, e.g. format of headers and timeslots.

==== Importing interviewers’ availability
Imports interviewers’ availability from a comma separated values (CSV) file. After import command is ran, the GUI should display the imported data.

NOTE: The schedule displayed will only show timeslots within the <<Working Hours, Working Hours>> and <<Duration of Timeslot, Duration>> that the user has specified.

Key formatting information for Interviewer's Data:

* The first column of each day's schedule will consist of the timeslots for that day.
* Each timeslot should also be in the format `HH:mm - HH:mm`.
* The very first header at the top left-hand corner should indicate the day of the schedule. The subsequent headers should indicate the interviewers in the format `DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEWER'S_NAME`.
* A "1" in a timeslot represents that the interviewer in that column is *available* and "0" represents that he/she is *unavailable*.
* Separation of different days of schedules is made by leaving 2 empty lines after the end of the first table.

Format of command: `import interviewer fp/PATH_TO_FILE` +
    - PATH_TO_FILE is the absolute path to the file. +
    - E.g. C:\\Users\Bob\file.csv

Example:

 import interviewer fp/C:\Users\johndoe\Interviewers.csv

Constraints:

* Timeslots must obey the allowed values that are specified in the <<User Preferences, User Preferences>>.
* Duplicate entries of the same interviewer (same name) cannot be presented in the CSV file to be imported.
* If none of the interviewers are available for a particular day, e.g. all "0" for all timeslots on that day, the GUI will not display the schedule for that day.

==== Importing interviewees’ availability
Imports interviewees’ availability from a comma separated values (CSV) file.

NOTE: There will be no changes in the schedules tab after the import of interviewee's data. The changes will be made after <<Scheduling `schedule`, Schedule>> command has been ran.

Key formatting information for Interviewee's Data:

* Headers specify the details of the Interviewee to be imported. The order of the headers must be strictly followed as shown in the above template.
* Emails: Adding more than 1 personal or work email is allowed. Use whitespaces to separate each email.
* Timeslots: Each timeslot should be in the format `dd/MM/yyy HH:mm - HH:mm`. Use commas to separate the timeslots if there are more than 1.
* There can only be 1 unique value for all other fields. Commas should not be used in these fields.

Format: `import interviewee fp/PATH_TO_FILE` +
    - PATH_TO_FILE is the absolute path to the file. +
    - E.g C:\\Users\Bob\file.csv

Example:

 import interviewer fp/C:\Users\johndoe\Interviewees.csv

Constraints:

* Timeslots must obey the allowed values that are specified in the <<User Preferences, User Preferences>>.
* Duplicate entries of the same interviewee cannot be presented in the CSV file to be imported.
