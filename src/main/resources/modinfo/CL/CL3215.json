    "description": "This module takes students through an exciting journey of discovering Chinese culture through the Chinese language. Instead of seeing language as a tool, students are trained to view language as the container of culture from ancient Chinese to modern Chinese. They will learn cultural heritage from Chinese phrases, understand ancient way of life through the creation of Chinese characters, study Chinese culture through Chinese dialects and borrowing words. They will also learn that Chinese names of places and surnames are all related to Chinese culture and how Chinese kinship terms reflect the culture of family relationships.",
