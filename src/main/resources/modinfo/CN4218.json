    "description": "This module provides students with both basic concepts\nand applications for the synthesis and handling of\nparticulate materials, covering various topics such as\ncolloids and fine particles, pharmaceutical particle\nsynthesis and processing, dynamics of particulate\nsystems, fluidization, pneumatic conveying and standpipe,\nelectrostatics for particle processing, particulate flow\nmetering and tomography, discreate element method and\ncontinuum modeling. Particulate solids are characterised in\nterms of size, size distribution, measurement and analysis\nand processing such as comminution and mixing. The\npharmaceutical, biomedical and energy applications of\nparticle technology will be covered at the end of the\nmodule.",
