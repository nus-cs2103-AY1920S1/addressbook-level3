    "description": "Situated between India and China, Southeast Asia in historical times became an important economic and geostrategic nexus in the context of the international trade that stretched from Europe to China and the big power rivalry that accompanied it. As its significance grew, internal conditions within Southeast Asia adjusted to accommodate increased external contacts while the rival powers, including those from the periphery and from without the region, increasingly saw Southeast Asia as an element in the global power game. This module will examine the structure of Southeast Asia?s history within this global context, relating the nature and sequence of its history to developments in the wider international milieu.",
