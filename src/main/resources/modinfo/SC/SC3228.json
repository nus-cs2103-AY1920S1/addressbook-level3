    "description": "This module is about how the senses organise different dimensions of social life. How are race, gender, and class identities related to sensory perceptions? How do the senses shape power relations and knowledge production? In order to address these queries, the module interrogates how sensory experience lies beyond the realm of individual, physiological responses by analysing a range of sensory faculties through cross\u2010cultural comparative approaches. Students are introduced to key ideas in sensory scholarship and will be equipped with analytical tools to examine the senses in relation to selfhood and identity, urbanity, politics, religion, and heritage.",
