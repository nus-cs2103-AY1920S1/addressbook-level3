    "description": "This course examines recent language controversies from different angles. It will focus on four main themes: language change, discrimination on the basis of accent, gender miscommunication, and the language of advertisements. Responsible scholarship and citizenship require the ability and eagerness to go beyond stereotype, common belief and the popular press to evaluate claims for oneself in a knowledgeable way. This course will provide facts, theory, and analytic tools with which to consider the four issues mentioned above.",
