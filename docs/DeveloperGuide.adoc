== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Statistics`*>>: Holds the statistics calculations of App.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::uicomponent[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

* The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

* The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

// end::uicomponent[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Guilt Trip data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage`

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the GuiltTrip data in json format and read it back.
* This includes instances of Entry subclasses (Expense, Income, Wish, AutoExpenses, Budget, etc.)

== Implementation
This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::Categories[]

=== Data Presentation: Categories
==== Implementation

.Class Diagram for Categories

image::CategoryListClassDiagram.png[]

For all entries in guiltTrip, the entries should always belong to one category.
Creation of categories are also helpful for breakdown of statistics to be complete.
The implementation of `Category` and `CategoryList` are largely similar to `UniqueEntryList` in
the original AddressBook. However, the slight difference lies in that `Category` is a field of
`Entry` instead of being a child of `Entry` itself. A `Category` can only belong under Expense or Income, which
is defined by the Enum `CategoryType.EXPENSE` or `CategoryType.INCOME`.
When the user launches the application for the first time or if there are errors with `data/guiltTrip.json`,
the application will load the default set of `Category` by `SampleDataUtil#getSampleCategories()`.

There are 3 main checks to be carried out when interacting with `Category`.

* When adding a Category, there is a need to check that the new Category added does not
exist in the existing guiltTrip, hence the need for `CategoryList#contains(Category)`.
* When editing a `Category`, there is a need to check that the new Category added does not
exist in the existing guiltTrip, hence the need for `CategoryList#contains(Category)` as well as a need to check
if there are existing entries of the original `Category` to carry out modifications on them.
* When deleting a `Category`, there is a need to check if there are any entries that have the `Category` as a field.

// tag::EditingCategories[]
Given below is an example of an activity diagram for editing a category to illustrate the point above.

.Activity Diagram for Editing Category
image::EditingCategory.png[width=80%]
// end::EditingCategories[]
As the rest of the implementation is similar to AB3's CRUD, it won't be covered.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect: Deciding whether to allow addition of Categories*

* *Alternative 1*: Having a fixed set of Categories in the `CategoryList`, users are unable to add delete or edit the existing set of Categories.
    ** Pros: Easy to implement.
    ** Cons: Results in less flexibility for the user.
* *Alternative 2*: Users are allowed to have any category names for their entries. There is no `CategoryList` to carry out validation checks on.
    ** Pros: Intuitive and convenient for the user.
    ** Cons: Calculation of Statistics would be messy if the user adds many different categories for their entries on a whim, the breakdown of statistics by category could be huge.
* *Alternative 3(Current)*: There is a fixed set of categories, with users able to add delete or edit the existing set of Categories, but a command must be consciously called by the user to modify the categories in the `CategoryList`.
    ** Pros: Allows the flexibility for addition of additional categories as well as solving the many different categories problem if alternative 2 was taken as users have to make the conscious effort to create a new category.
    ** Cons: Slightly more complicated to implement.
// end::Categories[]

// tag::Sort[]
=== Data Presentation: Sort Command

==== Implementation

The sort command extends the `Command` class. It works on the `ObservableList` by wrapping the `ObservableList` on a
`SortedList` and adding a `EntryComparator` to the List.
By default, the `Entry` in GuiltTrip are sorted by `Date`, followed by `Amount`,
`Description`, `Category`, and finally `Tags`.
In addition, after every CRUD command, the list is sorted by default for the user's convenience.

A Sort Command contains:

* `SortType` : `Date`, `Amount`, `Description`, `Category`, and `Tags`.
* `SortSequence`: Ascending, Descending

An Example of Sorting the Expense List is shown below

.  The user executes the command `sortExpense typ/Amount s/ascending`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command
.  This results in a `SortExpenseCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`
.  The `SortExpenseCommand` calls the `Model#sortFilteredExpenseList` to sort the list of expenses
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object

[NOTE]
The `Model#sortFilteredExpenseList` creates an `EntryComparator` which takes in `SortType` and `SortSequence` to sort the list.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("sortExpense typ/Amount s/ascending")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sortExpense typ/Amount s/ascending` Command
image::SortSequence.png[]
// end::Sort[]

// tag::Find[]
=== Data Presentation: Find Command
Finding is similar to the implementation of AB3, hence it will not be covered in detail.
However, the find command is expanded to include finding by multiple predicates at once.
For Example, the user can find by both `Amount` and `Description`. These are the relevant predicates:

* `EntryContainsAmountPredicate`: Will filter the list to include those with equal or higher amounts than the amount specified.
* `EntryContainsCategoryPredicate`: Will filter the list to include the category specified.
* `EntryContainsDatePredicate`: Will filter the list to include the Date specified. Currently only supports searching within the month.
* `EntryContainsTagsPredicate`: Will filter the list to include those with all the specified tags.
* `EntryContainsDescriptionPredicate`: Will filter the list to include only those with descriptions that contain the keywords.
// end::Find[]

// tag::Statistics[]
=== Data Presentation: Statistics

.Class Diagram for Statistics Component.

image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[width=50%]

The Statistics class diagram is shown above. Many of the operations are handled by StatisticsManager.
The two main operations for calculation of Statistics are:

* `StatisticsManager#updateListOfStats(rangeOfDates)`: Calculates the statistics for categories according to the range of dates specified.
Calls on `MonthList#updateListOfStats(Category)` to calculate the list of Stats across Categories in that `MonthList`, thus updating the list of `Category Statistics`.
* `StatisticsManager#updateBarChart(monthToCalculate)`: Calculates the daily statistics according to the month specified.
Calls on `MonthList#CalculateStatisticsForBarChart()` which will call on `DailyList#CalculateStatisticsForBarChart()` to update the
list of `DailyStatistics`.

==== Implementation: (Statistics) - ViewPieChart/ViewTable Command

The ViewPie and ViewTable commands are a unique case as they both depend on `CategoryStatistics`. StatisticsManager has two `ObservableList` of `CategoryStatistics`, one for `Expense`, *listOfStatsForExpense*
and one for `Income`, *listOfStatsForIncome*.
The `StatisticsPieChart` and `StatisticsTable` in guiltTrip listens to these two `ObservableList`, and will update accordingly. Hence all operations
which involve calculation of category statistics needs to update this `ObservableList` by replacing its entries so as to
update the relevant Pie Chart and Table in the Ui.

.Activity Diagram when user wants to view the statistics in Pie Chart form.
image::ViewPieActivityDiagram.png[]

The overview of this process can be found in the Activity Diagram above.

The details of the process is as below:

. The user executes the command `viewPie p/2019-09,2019-11`
.  `LogicManager` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `viewPieChartCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `viewPieChartCommand` calls the `Model#updateListOfStats(RangeOfDates)` 's method which then calls `StatisticsManager#updateListOfStats(RangeOfDates)` method to calculate the statistics for that type.
.  `StatisticsManager#updateListOfStats(RangeOfDates)` detects that the size of the list is 2 and calls `#getListOfMonths(RangeOfDates)` to retrieve the list of `MonthList` *MonthListToCalculate* from start Date to End Date from `yearlyRecord`, the `ObservableMap` inside `StatisticsManager`.
.  `StatisticsManager#updateListOfStats(RangeOfDates)` then calls `StatisticsManager#countStats(MonthListToCalculate, listOfStatistics)`, which will calculate the list of statistics for
expense and income categories and create many new `CategoryStatistics` objects to save the data of the calculated Statistics for each Category.
.  `StatisticsManager#countStats(MonthListToCalculate, listOfStatistics)` will replace the all the `CategoryStatistics` objects in the `ObservableList` of `CategoryStatistics` with the newly calculated `CategoryStatistics` objects.
.  As the `ObservableList` is updated, the PieChart and Table which uses this `ObservableList` is also updated, leading to them being updated.
.  Finally, `StatisticsManager#countStats(MonthListToCalculate, listOfStatistics)` will set the new TotalExpense and TotalIncome values to the new values calculated, which will also update the `Ui` for Stats which displays the total expense and total income.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("viewPie p/2019-09,2019-11")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `viewPie p/2019-09,2019-11` Command
image::ViewPieChartSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation: (Statistics) - ViewBarChartCommand
Similar to `ViewPie` and `ViewTable`, the `StatisticsBarChart` class listens to the `ObservableList` of `DailyStatistics` and will update
according to changes in it. Hence all operations which involve calculation of daily statistics needs to update this `ObservableList` by replacing its entries so as to
update the relevant Bar Chart in `Ui`.

The details of the process is as below:

. The user executes the command `viewBar p/2019-09`
.  `LogicManager` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `ViewBarChartCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`
.  The `ViewBarChartCommand` calls the `Model#updateBarChart(MonthToShow)` 's method which then calls `StatisticsManager#updateBarChart(monthToShow)` method to calculate the statistics for that period.
.  `StatisticsManager#updateBarChart(MonthToShow)` retrieves the relavant MonthList from `ObservableMap`, yearlyRecord and calls `MonthList#calculateStatisticsForBarChart`.
.  The called `MonthList` will then loop through all the DailyList in it and calls `DailyList#calculateStatisticsForBarChart`, retrieving the result and
returning it to `StatisticsManager`.
.  `StatisticsManager#updateBarChart(MonthToShow)` will replace the all the `DailyStatistics` objects in the `ObservableList` of `DailyStatistics` with the newly calculated `DailyStatistics` objects.
.  As the `ObservableList` is updated, the BarChart which uses this `ObservableList` is also updated, leading to them being updated.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("viewBar p/2019-09")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `viewBar p/2019-09` Command
image::ViewBarChartSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations: Statistics
*Aspect: Calculation of Income and Expenses*

* *Alternative 1*: Set a predicate on the filteredlist of income and filteredlist of expense to filter out the number of income and expenses which are within the time period of the statistics query.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of runtime, as if multiple queries are carried out in a row which are the same, recalculation needs to be done every single time.
* *Alternative 2(current choice)*: Have MonthList and DailyList classes which store the specific filteredlist of expenses for that month. This is a new filteredlist which observes the changes in the original list of expenses and is updated if a new expense is added which corresponds to the month.
** Pros: Will be faster as initiating the expenses in the MonthList is only done at the start of the application. Any queries after that just refers to the already constructed MonthList. It is also structured as calculations of expenses now involve going to the related MonthList to carry out the calculations.
** Cons: More complicated to implement.
[NOTE]
There isn’t a need to use YearList as most users will usually want to see their statistics breakdown over a period of a month rather than over a period of years.

*Aspect: Updating of charts whenever add delete edit commands is called*

* *Alternative 1*: Disallow non-stats commands in the stats window.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May not be intuitive for the user and creates hassle.
* *Alternative 2(current choice)*: Adds a Listener to the list of filtered expenses. The listener will update the relevant charts whenever it detects that there is a change in the expenses or incomes.
** Pros: Intuitive for the user.
** Cons: Takes a toll on the time complexity if large bulks of data was added through AutoExpense.

==== Proposed Extension
* Currently Statistics Breakdown doesn't show details like trends across months. A future implementation could involve
showing the user what category of spending increases across the months. For example, it could reflect that spending for
category Entertainment increased the most in the past months.
* Bar Chart can be further improved to show analysis of breakdown of category by day and observe trends for the user.
For example, it could notice that the user has been spending a lot every Tuesday and alert the user about it.
// end::Statistics[]

// tag::uifeature[]
=== Toggle Panel Command

==== Implementation

.Partial class diagram showing only the classes in `UI` involved in the Toggle Panel Command.
image::PartialUiClassDiagramForToggle.png[]

The `toggle` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the `CommandResult` obtained from `Logic`
if the user wants to toggle a specified panel. If so, it toggles the `isVisible` and `isManaged` properties of the place
holder for that panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how an example usage scenario `toggle wishlist` would work:

.Interactions inside the Logic and UI components for the `toggle wishlist` command
image::ToggleSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram is as explained below:

. The user launches the application and executes the `toggle wishlist` command to toggle the `wishlist` panel.
. `commandResult` is obtained in `MainWindow` after the command is parsed and executed.
. `MainWindow` checks if the `togglePanel` attribute in `commandResult` is true.
. Since it is true, it retrieves the `PanelName` `WISH` from `commandResult` and calls on its own method `handleTogglePanel`.
. This method then calls on another method `togglePanel()` that toggles the panel and takes in the `PanelName` `WISH` as a parameter.
.. (Not shown in sequence diagram to reduce its complexity) It also checks if the wishlist is already shown in the main panel.
.. If it is, then a `CommandException` is thrown to prevent the user from toggling the wishlist side panel when the wishlist is already shown in the main panel.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `toggle` command:

.Activity diagram showing what happens when user executes a `toggle` command
image::ToggleActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current method):* Toggle the panels from within `MainWindow`.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.

* *Alternative 2:* `MainWindow` has a `PanelManager` class that manages all the side panels (toggling them on and off).

** Pros: More OOP, reduces number of methods and lines of code in `MainWindow`.

** Cons: May introduce cyclic dependency between `PanelManager` and `MainWindow`.

=== Change Font Command

==== Implementation

The `changeFont` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the
`CommandResult` obtained from `Logic` if the user wants to change the application font.
If so, it immediately changes the font without requiring the user to exit and launch the application again.

[NOTE]
This change in font is also saved in `UserPrefs`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an example usage scenario `changeFont rockwell` would work:

.Interactions inside Logic and UI components for the `changeFont rockwell` command
image::ChangeFontSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram is as explained below:

. The user launches the application and executes the `changeFont rockwell` command to change the current application font to _rockwell_.
. `commandResult` is obtained in `MainWindow` after the command is parsed and executed.
. `MainWindow` checks if the `changeFont` attribute in `commandResult` is true.
. Since it is true, it retrieves the `FontName` `ROCKWELL` from `commandResult` and calls on its own method `handleChangeFont`.
. This method then converts the `FontName` `ROCKWELL` to a `String "rockwell"` and sets the `font-family` attribute of `window`, that contains all the child nodes, to `rockwell`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `changeFont` command:

.Activity diagram showing what happens when user executes a `changeFont` command
image::ChangeFontActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Change the application font from within `MainWindow`.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: May not be as OOP as other methods.

* *Alternative 2:* Use a separate class to control the theme, such as `ThemeManager`.

** Pros: More OOP, reduces amount of code in `MainWindow`.

** Cons: As the implementation is not very complicated, introducing a new class just to change the theme may not be worth the increase in dependency (introduces dependency between `Theme` and `ThemeManager` and between `ThemeManager` and `MainWindow`).

=== Set Light/Dark Theme Command

==== Implementation

The `setLightTheme`/`setDarkTheme` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the `CommandResult` obtained from `Logic` if the user wants to change the theme of the application.
If so, it immediately changes the theme without requiring the user to exit and launch the application again.

[NOTE]
This change in the application theme is also saved in `UserPrefs`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an example usage scenario `setLightTheme` would work:

.Interactions inside Logic and UI components for `setLightTheme` command
image::SetLightThemeSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram is as explained:

. The user launches the application and executes the `setLightTheme` command to change the current theme to _light_.
. `commandResult` is obtained in `MainWindow` after the command is parsed and executed.
. `MainWindow` checks if the `changeTheme` attribute in `commandResult` is true.
. Since it is true, it retrieves the `newTheme` from `commandResult`, `LIGHT`, and calls on its own method `switchThemeTo(LIGHT)`.
.. (Following details were trivial and thus omitted from the diagram) This method retrieves the URLs for the light theme and corresponding extensions css files and adds it to the stylesheets for the scene.
This is done after removing the stylesheets for the previous theme.
. This implementation is essentially the same for `setDarkTheme` command, with the `newTheme` as `DARK` instead.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `setLightTheme` command:

.Activity diagram showing what happens when user executes a `setLightTheme` command
image::SetLightThemeActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Change the theme from within `MainWindow`.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: May not be as OOP as it could be, increases number of lines of code in `MainWindow`.

* *Alternative 2:* Use a separate class to control the theme, such as `ThemeManager`.

** Pros: Abstracts out the methods regarding changing of theme to be contained in `ThemeManager` and reduces the number of lines of code in `MainWindow`.

** Cons: Harder to implement; may introduce cyclic dependency.
It may also be redundant or excessive as implementing the `changeFont` command is not very complicated.

// end::uifeature[]

// tag::qol[]

=== Quality of Life features

==== AutoSuggester
===== Implementation
AutoSuggester is one of the most visible and widely used UX feature in the GuiltTrip application.
It grabs users' input from the command box using a listener,
and returns suggetions using a `CommandSuggester` 's `suggest()` method, displayed in the `ResultDisplay` panel.

image::AutoSuggestClassDiagram.png[]
Figure: Class Diagram for AutoSuggest.

[NOTE]
Terminology: `AutoSuggest` refers to the feature as a whole.
`AutoSuggestion` is the term users see in GuiltTrip application.
`CommandSuggester` is the functional interface in the source code.
`GuiltTripCommandSuggester` is the class that gives suggestions based on user input.

Currently AutoSuggester carries out two functions:

1. suggesting full commands when halfway typing any command
1. displaying help messages when a complete command is detected.

While a user is typing out commands, AutoSuggester will provide recommendation to the
nearest valid command. For example, typing out `add` will suggest `addIncome`, `addExpense`,
`help` etc, based on the matching algorithm used. Currently, an edit distance metric based
on `edit, delete and inserting letters` is used, as implemented by the `EditDistanceComparator` class.

Upon typing out any valid command in full, AutoSuggester fetches the usage of the current
command and show it in the `ResultDisplay`. This usage message is distinguished from error messages
by prepending a line prefixed `[Autosuggestion]` above the usage message displayed.

===== Design considerations
.Aspect: How to select the closest match to commands
We notice this is the well researched
http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/deb01.pdf[Approximate String Matching] problem
and has complicated ways to implement.

* *Alternative 1*: Use the algorithm implemented in
https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[FZF], the fuzzy file finder.

** Pros: Very user friendly. especially for longer commands.
    Suitable for history searching when paired with
    Mozilla's https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm[Frecency algorithm].
** Cons: Needs time to understand and implement.

* *Alternative 2: (currently implemented)*
Simple edit distance using a memoized dynamic programming approach.

** Pros: Easier to implement. Merely 10 lines with memoization.
** Cons: Takes `O(nm)` time to compare two strings, which means approximately `O(n^2)`
    time to create a priority queue of nearest commands.

.To be implemented in `v2.0`: parsing the command in real time and suggest possible choices
for each for every argument.

* *Possible implementation*: Initialize prefix objects with a list of possible `String` of values
    given that prefix, which can be displayed in autosuggestion.

==== AutoExpenses
===== Implementation
AutoExpenses will create expenses automatically once created. This update is done during
every startup, when model manager is being initialized.

image::AutoExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[]

`AutoExpense` extends the Entry class, but has special attributes of its own:

. `lastTime` which keeps track of the date of last Expense generated
. Uses `Date` attribute to keep track the creation date of this object
. `Frequency` enum which keeps track of the frequency of the `AutoExpense`.

The only state-changing, outfacing method is `generateNewExpenses()`, which will
not only return a `List` of `Expenses` since `lastTime`, but also update the `lastTime`
attribute to match the latest `Expense` in the list returned.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when user creates a new AutoExpense:

image::AutoExpenseActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations
.Aspect: How to encode the recurring nature of AutoExpense
* *Alternative 1*: Embrace the good practice of immutable objects and
    create a new AutoExpense object every time a new Expense is generated

** Pros: Easier to prevent duplicate Expense generation since state is not changed.
** Cons: Space intensive, also not necessary to recreate as only one field change (`lastTime`)

* *Alternative 2: (currently implemented)*
    Keep track of the state using an attribute `lastTime`, and change the state of the
    `AutoExpense` object every update.

** Pros: Easier to implement, and more space-friendly.
** Cons: State changes are not saved or recorded in anyway.

.Aspect: How to update AutoExpenses to generate new Expense objects
* *Alternative 1:*: Use a thread to check every now and then, preferable every minute
    for consistent updates.
** Pros: Reliable and more orthodox way of checking for updates.
** Cons: Hard to implement. Not sure how to debug.

* *Alternative 2: (currently implemented)*
    Update at every startup only.
** Pros: Resource efficient. We take advantage of the assumption that
***         Users will usually open the app for no longer than a day.
***         The highest frequency an AutoExpense can be is currently *daily*.
** Cons: Above assumptions have to be true.

// end::qol[]

// tag::reminders[]
=== Reminders

==== Implementation
The reminders implementation is facilitated by the reminder class, and heavily makes use of the observable pattern to keep track with property changes in the GuilTrip model to display messages in a timely fashion.

image::ReminderClassDiagram.png[]

====== The class diagram above shows the relation between the classes that help to implement the reminder feature.

===== There are 2 types of reminders. General and entry reminders.

General reminders are not tied to any specific entry, and sent the user notifications whenever an entry matching the user specified conditions is entered in the app. These specified conditions include entry type, a lower and upper quota for the entry amount, a specified time period in which an entry takes place, or a list of tags which the entry must have.

image::GeneralReminderSequenceDiagram.png[GRS, 1000, 600]

====== The sequence diagram above illustrates what happens when an entry fulfils all conditions in an entry.

STEP 1)  When an expense is logged in to GuiltTrip.java, in addition to being stored in the Expense List, the expense is also passed into the Condition Manager, which iterates through its list of conditions to see which conditions are met by the entry.

STEP 2)  Each condition makes use of a self-implemented ObservableSupport class that enables it to function as an Observable object, with the reminders being its listeners.

STEP 3)  When a condition is met, it notifies the reminder it belongs to. The reminders keep track of the number of conditions met, and only when all conditions are met does it make use of ObservableSupport to notify the reminderlist about a change in its status.

STEP 4)  The reminder list generates a notification corresponding to the reminder and adds it to an observable list which is displayed by the Ui.

STEP 5)  The number of conditions met is reset a the end of the process so the reminders may continue to produce notifications when subsequent entries meeting the requirements are keyed into the system.

An entry reminder targets a specific expense/ income or wish. It is set to send notifications at a specified period at specified intervals before the date of the event.

image::EntryReminderSequenceDiagram.png[ERS, 1000, 400]

====== The sequence diagram above illustrates what happens when an it is time for an entry reminder to send a notification.

STEP 1) This is made possible with TimeUtil, which is a singleton class with a single instance checking the local date at periodic intervals and updating its listeners (Using the ObservableSupport) of the current date.

STEP 2) All entry reminders are listeners of TimeUtil. When the updated current date equals the date to send a notification, it notifies the reminder list which generates a corresponding notification and sets the next date to notify the user.

STEP 3) Once the date of the event itself has passed, the reminder is deactivated and not saved the next time GuiltTrip is closed.

=== Design Considerations:
* **Alternative 1** (current method): Users must first select a reminder before they can edit or remove reminders.*
** Pros: Easier to implement. By automatically toggling the reminder list view on when selecting a reminder, the user also will see what    reminder they have selected before they proceed to make any changes. (As opposed to selecting and modifying the reminder in a single    command).
** Cons: Involves one more step. Not as efficient.

* **Alternative 2** Users commands require an index argument to indicate the reminder to modify.
** Pros: Faster as it involves one less step. May be more convenient for users who frequently forget to first select reminder to modify.
** Cons: Aforementioned benefits are mitigated as reminders are hidden in default GUI settings, and most users will have to open up the    reminderList to know which reminder to modify anyway.

=== Undo/ Redo

==== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
It extends `GuiltTrip` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `guiltTripStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGuiltTrip#commit()` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#undo()` -- Restores the previous finance trackerk state from its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` and `Model#redoGuiltTrip()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGuiltTrip` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th entry in the finance tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `guiltTripStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add typ/Expense...` to add a new expense. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGuiltTrip()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `guiltTripStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` or `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`. Thus, the `guiltTripStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `guiltTripStateList`, all finance tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add typ/Expense ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire GuiltTrip.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
