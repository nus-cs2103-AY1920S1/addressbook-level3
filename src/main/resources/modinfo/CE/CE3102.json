    "description": "This enhancement module enables students to relate the practice of engineering to the socio-cultural context within which the practice of engineering and the final engineered product must operate. The module introduces the key concepts of socio-technical projects which pose open-ended, complex problems requiring a systemic mode of problem solving. These concepts are introduced through extensive fieldwork wherein students encounter real life problems for which they work to create acceptable solutions independently as well as part of a team. The fieldwork is designed to draw students away from familiar cultural and institutional settings to more varied and challenging contexts which a globalized engineering work-force will encounter. As the field-work will be carried out during the vacation, final assessment will be available only at the end of the following semester.",
