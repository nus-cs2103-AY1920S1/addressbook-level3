== PROJECT: Mark (Bookmark Manager)

:sectnums:

== Overview

My team of 5 software engineering students was tasked with morphing an existing
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application]
into a useful application for a specific target group. We chose to create a bookmark manager application
known as Mark, which is intended to help computing students manage their web browsing activities.
Mark was conceptualised and implemented over a period of 8 weeks.

This is what Mark looks like:

My role as a developer was to design and
implement a mechanism to allow bookmarks to be categorised automatically. I also improved Mark's storage functionality
and contributed to various team tasks. The following sections describe these contributions in more detail.

== Summary of contributions

This section summarizes my code, documentation, and team-related contributions to Mark.

*Major feature*: I implemented the *autotag* mechanism to facilitate the automatic categorisation of bookmarks.

* _What it does_: Allows bookmarks to be tagged automatically based on a predefined set of conditions.
* _Justification_: Organising bookmarks is time-consuming as bookmarks must be edited individually. This enhancement
allows users to categorise their bookmarks without additional effort.
* _Highlights_: Designing the autotag mechanism required significant planning to conceptualize
how abstract autotag conditions should be stored. In addition, this feature involved development in all
major components of Mark.

*Minor feature*: I enhanced Mark's existing storage system by adding the capacity to *export* and *import* bookmarks.
It allows users to save and retrieve bookmarks from different files on the hard disk without exiting Mark, so that
they can preserve old bookmarks without cluttering their current dashboard.

*Other contributions*

* *Project management*: I facilitated weekly team meetings to discuss the team's progress and
managed release https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/releases/tag/v1.2.1[`v1.2.1`] on GitHub.

* *Enhancements to existing features and code-related contributions*: I migrated the code from AddressBook Level 3 to Mark
(https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/14[#14], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/62[#62]),
created a custom URL validation to be used when no Internet connection is available
(https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/14[#14], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/117[#117]),
and updated the list of sample data used when Mark is first opened
(https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/227[#227]).

* *Documentation*:
I improved the layout and organisation of the User Guide
(https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/248[#248],
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/254/files[#254]) as well as
documented the design of the Model component in the Developer Guide

https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/264[#264]).

* **Community**:
I reviewed team members' Pull Requests and offered suggestions to increase the clarity of messages and improve code quality
(https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-4/main/pull/74#discussion_r332867503[#74],
