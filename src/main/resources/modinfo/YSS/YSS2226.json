    "description": "This course will offer an introduction to linguistics and the anthropological study of language. The first half of the course will deal with the basics of the formal study of language in phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The second half of the course will consider linguistic and wider communicative practice within its social, cultural, and historical contexts. Participants will pay special attention to the relationship between language and power, both in terms of social structure and within the development of the larger political worlds in which we live. This course assumes no pre- or corequisite and serves as a survey course for the anthropology major.",
