    "description": "This module covers the practical study of solfege as taught in many conservatories around the world. The module caters to those students who have little or no background in solfege but those with some solfege background may also register for it. The texts used are classics: George Dandelot\u2019s 'Manuel Practique', Dannhauser\u2019s sight-singing books and Pasquale Bona\u2019s 'Rhythmical Articulation.' Students will be learning the Fixed Do solfege system. Four of the seven clefs used in music reading and transposition will also be covered. These are the Treble, Bass, Alto and Tenor clefs.",
