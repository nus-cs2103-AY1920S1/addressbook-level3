    "description": "Infrastructures enable and constrain the movement of people, goods, information and values across wide swaths of space and time. This module examines the dynamic interplay between infrastructures and mobilities across shifting historical and geographic settings in Southeast Asia. First, we survey influential approaches to the study of infrastructures, examining how they mediate and shape movement, mobilities and everyday modes of communication. We then explore these issues with reference to historical and contemporary case studies throughout Southeast Asia.",
