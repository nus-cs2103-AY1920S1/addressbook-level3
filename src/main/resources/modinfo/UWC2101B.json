    "description": "This module teaches writing and critical thinking through a\ncritical exploration of theories of civic and public discourse\nas they were configured by the ancient Greeks. Topics\ndiscussed include the political, ethical, and emotional uses\nand impacts of civic discourse. The module thus provides\nthe chance for students to gain a critical awareness of the\nnatures of their own engagement with public discourses, to\ncontextualise these discourses both locally and\ninternationally, and to explore the possible futures of\ncommunities of which they are a part.",
