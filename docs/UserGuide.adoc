== Introduction
In order to encourage and facilitate these consumer behaviours that can reduce food waste,
we have designed iFridge, an easy-to-use application that allows users to keep track and manage
their food inventory in the Grocery List feature, generate shopping lists in Shopping List, and
track their food waste and monthly performance in the Waste List feature. We also allow you to
create Template Lists: If you have a list of staple items you wish to maintain in your fridge,
you can store it as a template list so that you can generate a shopping list based on what is
currently missing from your pantry. +

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Item types*

* There are two types of items in this application: grocery item (which is a concrete item that you own) and food item (which is an item you think you would like to own in the future).
* A grocery item is like a purchased/owned item. Thus, it must have a name, an expiry date, and amount. A grocery item can have one or more tags depending on preferences.
* A food item must have a name and amount. A food item cannot have any expiry date and tag. Food item is usually used to arrange for shopping or template in this application.
====

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `glist add n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE a/AMOUNT`, `ITEM_NAME`, `EXPIRY_DATE`, and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `glist add n/apple e/23/10/2019 a/3units`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `glist add n/NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE a/AMOUNT [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/apple e/23/10/2019 a/3units t/fruit` or as `n/apple e/23/10/2019 a/3units`.
* Items with … after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/fruit`, `t/fruit t/healthy` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE`, `e/EXPIRY_DATE n/ITEM_NAME` is also acceptable.
* If multiple arguments of the same type are provided, the last argument for that field will be taken as the input. Eg: `glist add n/FirstName n/Apple a/5units e/28/11/2019` will create a GroceryItem with the name 'Apple'.
====

[[same-name]]
====
*About the Name Parameter*

* Name is considered the same if they match exactly while ignoring case sensitivity. For example, `Chicken` is the same as `Chicken` and `chicKEN`.
====

[[same-tag]]
====
*About the Tag Parameter*

* Tag is considered the same if they match exactly considering case sensitivity. For example, `Chicken` is the same as `Chicken` but not `chiCKEN`,
====

[[amount-parameter]]
====
*About the Amount Parameter*

* The iFridge app allows for some flexibility with the units inputted with the amount. The following units are accepted this application:
ml, L, oz, lbs, kg, g, units.
* Whitespace between magnitude and unit is allowed.
* Several commands involve computation of amounts. Units are classified under three unit types:
- *Volume:* ml, L
- *Weight:* g, kg, oz, lbs
- *Quantity:* units
* Conversion of units can only be applied on the same classification. The conversion implemented in this app is shown in the table below. +
* Cross conversion between units of the same categories is supported.
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Amount in the unit specified | Amount in standard form (kg, L, units)

| 1ml | 0.001L
| 1g  | 0.001kg
| 1oz | 0.00283495kg
| 1lbs| 0.453592kg
|===
* The amount displayed for each item is rounded off to 4 decimal points to provide a reasonable level of precision.
* A certain minimum value is imposed on the `Amount` class (0.1ml for Volume, 0.1kg for Weight, and 0.1units for Quantity) to ensure consistency.
* When adding or editing items, the system will only allow items with similar names (checking is non-case-sensitive) to have similar unit types. However,
the adding of items with conflicting unit types will not be allowed.
====

=== Grocery List Management

==== Adding a food item: `glist add`

Adds a grocery item to the grocery list. +
Format: `glist add n/ITEM_NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE a/AMOUNT [t/TAG]`

****
* `e/EXPIRY_DATE` must follow the format `dd/MM/yyyy`.
* `a/AMOUNT` must have a magnitude i.e. measurable quantity and a unit. Magnitude and unit can be separated by spaces. Refer <<amount-parameter, here>> for more info.
* There may be more than one tag field.
* The input fields can be in any order.
* Item with *either <<same-name, same name>> or expiry date* as the existing ones can be added.
* Item with *same name and expiry date* as the existing ones cannot be added.
****

Examples:

* `glist add n/Fuji apples e/30/10/2019 t/healthy a/10units` +
Add Fuji apples of quantity 10 units, tagged as "healthy" and expiring on 30 October 2019.
* `glist add n/salad a/3units e/25/09/2019` +
Add salad of quantity 3 units, untagged and expiring on 25 September 2019.
* `glist add n/tea a/200 ml e/18/10/2019 t/fresh t/drink` +
Add tea of quantity 200 ml, tagged as "fresh" and "drink" and expiring on 18 October 2019.

==== Listing all grocery items: `glist list`

Shows a list of grocery items in the grocery list. +
Format: `glist list`

==== Deleting a grocery item: `glist delete`

Deletes the specified grocery item from the grocery list when it is done being used.
If the grocery item is not completely used up when deleted (i.e. `amount` > 0), the item will be moved to the waste list. +
Format: `glist delete INDEX`

==== Use a grocery item: `glist use`

Reduces the amount left of a grocery item by the specified amount. +
Format: `glist use INDEX a/AMOUNT`

****
* The amount left of a grocery item must be more than or equal to the specified amount to use.
* If the unit of input amount is different from the unit of item, the resultant amount would follow the unit of the original item. e.g. If an item of `1kg` is used by `300g`, it would become `0.7kg` and not `700g`.
****

Examples:

* `glist use 2 a/300g` +
Reduces the amount of 2nd item by 300 grams.
* `glist use 3 a/5 L` +
Reduces the amount of 3rd item by 5 liters.

==== Edit a grocery item: `glist edit`

Edits an existing item in the grocery list. +
Format: `glist edit INDEX [n/ITEM_NAME] [e/EXPIRY_DATE] [t/TAG]`

****
* Edits an item at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the number shown in the displayed list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided. At least one of the provided fields must be different from the original item's field.
* Amount cannot be edited, but can only be modified through `use`.
* Existing values will be updated to input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the item will be removed. i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the item's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* *As the grocery list does not allow duplicates (items with <<same-name, same name>> and expiry date), any attempt of edit to achieve duplication is not allowed and would result in an error.*
* *User is encouraged to practise discretion when editing an item as iFridge is unable to recognise items based on its name and compare between the name and amount of an item.*
For example, if an item named `Milk` with amount `2L` is edited to have the name `Beef`, iFridge would allow the edit, even though `Beef` with amount `2L` does not sound logical.
****

Examples:

* `glist edit 1 n/Fuji apple t/healthy` +
Edits the name and tag of the 1st item to be `Fuji apple` and `healthy` respectively.
* `glist edit 2 n/Olive oil t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd item to `Olive oil` and clears all existing tags.

==== Sort the grocery list: `glist sort`

Sorts the grocery list based on the type of sorting. +
Format: `glist sort by/TYPE` +

Sorting is done on the original grocery list. Hence, for example, when `sort` is done after `find`, both the resultant `find` list and the original list will be sorted.

The type of sorting supported is as follows:
****
* `alphabetical`: Sort the grocery list based on the item's name in ascending alphabetical order
* `expiry`: Sort the grocery list in ascending expiry date. i.e. from oldest to newest.
****

Examples:

* `glist sort by/alphabetical`
* `glist sort by/expiry`

==== Finding items by keywords: `glist find`

Finds items whose name or tag contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `glist find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `apple` will match `Apple`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `apple milk` will match `milk apple`
* Only the item name and tag are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `appl` will not match `apple`
* Grocery items matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. it uses an `OR` search). e.g. `apple dinner` will return `Apple juice`, `Pizza` tagged with `dinner`, and `Apple pie` tagged with `dinner`.
****

Examples:

* `glist find apple` +
Returns `Fuji apple` and `Apple loaf cake` and other items tagged as `apple`
* `glist find milo doughnut roasted` +
Returns any grocery item which contains any of the word `milo`, `doughnut`, or `roasted` as either name or tag or both

=== Waste List Management

==== Moving an item into waste list

When you delete an item from your grocery list using `delete`, the item will automatically be
moved into the waste list if it has not been fully used (the amount of food remaining > 0).

==== Viewing the waste list: `wlist list`

Shows a list of the food items which have been wasted +
Format: `wlist list [m/MONTH_OF_YEAR]` +
****
* If a particular month is specified, the food waste of the particular month will be displayed.
Otherwise, the food waste of the current month is displayed.
* The `MONTH_OF_YEAR` is the natural language month and year expression in English.
To avoid ambiguity, we recommend specifying the month and year in a relaxed date format,
e.g. `Aug 2019`. We also provide some flexibility by allowing you to specify relative date formats, e.g. `last month`.
[[month-req]]
[NOTE]
To view the exact specification on supported formats, we kindly refer you to http://natty.joestelmach.com/doc.jsp[Natty Library Documentation].
Note that if you have inadvertently specified a year longer than 4 digits, e.g. `Oct 20198`, we will only take the first 4 digits, which in this case will be `2019`.
Alternatively, if you have keyed in `Feb Jan 2019`, the first month will be taken as the month, which will be `Feb 2019`.

****

Examples:

* `wlist list` +
This will list out the current month's waste list.
* `wlist list m/sep 2019` +
This will list out the waste list for the month of September 2019, if such a record exists in our
waste archive (i.e. you have opened our application in the month of September 2019).

==== Displaying food wastage statistics: `wlist report`

Shows a charted report detailing your food wastage statistics across a time frame.
Format: `wlist report [sm/START_MONTH] [em/END_MONTH]`

****
* The report will display 3 charts: kg, litres and units of food wasted per month across the
time frame.

* The dates can be specified in any format permissible by the Natty library. If you only wish to
see your waste report starting 5 months ago, you can consider the command `wlist report sm/5 months ago`.
To avoid ambiguity, you are advised to specify the dates in the relaxed date format (e.g. `Sep 2019`).

[width="100%",cols="^2,^2, 8, 8",options="header"]
|==========================
|Start Month |End Month |Start Month Used |End Month Used
|&#10003; |&#10003;
|The start month follows that specified by the user, or the earliest record found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month follows that specified by the user, or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10003; |&#10007;
|The start month follows that specified by the user, or the earliest record found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month will be one year from the specified start month or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10007; |&#10003;
|The start month will be one year before the end month specified, or the earliest month found in our waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month follows that specified by the user, or the current month, whichever is earlier.
|&#10007; |&#10007;
|The start month would be one year ago from the current month, or the earliest month found in your waste archive,
whichever is later.
|The end month would be the current month.
|==========================

To illustrate an example, suppose we have a waste archive with waste data from the months of Oct 2018, Nov 2018, ...,
Oct 2019 (the current month). We specify Aug 2018 as a start month and Jun 2019 as an end month, as
shown below:

image::WasteReportTimeFrame.png[]

iFridge will generate the report using all available data within the time period, which will be
Oct 2018 to Jun 2019, highlighted in the yellow box.
****


Examples:

Suppose we have a waste archive with data from Oct 2018 to Oct 2019 (current month).

* `wlist report sm/Mar 2019` +
Generates a waste report from Mar 2019 to the current month of Oct 2019.
* `wlist report sm/Mar 2019 em/Sep 2019` +
Generates a waste report from Mar 2019 to Sep 2019
* `wlist report sm/Mar 2018` +
Generates a waste report from Oct 2018 to Mar 2019 (one year from Mar 2018)
* `wlist report sm/5 months ago` +
Generates a waste report from May 2019 to Oct 2019 (current month)

====
*Using the waste report*

* After a successful waste report command, there will be 3 charts displayed in different tabs, one for each of the following:

** Weight of food wasted (in kg) across the time frame
** Volume of food wasted (in litres) across the time frame
** Quantity of food wasted (in units) across the time frame

Our charts are interactive, you can get more details about your food wastage by interacting with our charts.

* Zooming on the chart: If you want to zoom in on a specific region of the graph, you can use your mouse to click and drag on the
preferred window.
* To retrieve more specific details on the food wastage for a particular month, you can choose to:
** click on the particular point in the chart, which will bring up the grid guidelines, or
** click on the month name in the horizontal axis, which will zoom in on the exact wastage details for that particular month.
* Returning to the original window: You can easily return to the original window by clicking on the title of the chart.

Below is an example of a waste report with the chart on food wastage in kg:

image::WasteReportWindow.png[]

_By clicking on the data point which lies on "March 2019", we can see that our food wastage for Mar 2019 is around 0.45kg._
====

==== Obtain feedback based on current food wastage: `wlist feedback`

Format: `wlist feedback`
****
Shows the current month’s wastage statistics:

* How many kg, litres, and units wasted so far
* Predicted wastage for the month
* Feedback on how user is managing food waste compared to the average food waste management across the past year
****

Our prediction algorithm: +
We first interpolate your current month's waste statistics to arrive at an estimate. Following which,
we take a weighted average of your waste statistics across the past couple of months to provide you with
a more reliable prediction.

As with any other application, our prediction algorithm will be more accurate with more frequent usage.

* `slist bought 2 e/03/11/2019 a/1kg`
Marks the item at index 2 as bought and sets its expiry date as 3rd November, 2019 and amount as 1 kilograms.

==== Add bought items: `slist mergebought`

This command represents a user moving all the bought items into the fridge.
It adds all items marked as ‘bought’ to the grocery list.
Format: `slist mergebought`

****
* Adds all the items marked as bought in shopping list into the grocery list.
* If the item with same expiry date is already present in the shopping list, just add the amount to the amount already present in the grocery list.
* For each bought item, if the amount bought is less than the amount of that item in the shopping list, the amount of that item in the shopping list is now the remaining amount to be bought.
** Eg: Consider a shopping item 'NAME: Orange, AMOUNT: 2units' in the shopping list.
** Then, when marking the item as bought, you indicate the amount of 'Orange' that is bought is 1unit.
** If now you call `slist mergebought`, shopping list will still have 'NAME: Orange, AMOUNT: 1units', i.e., the amount in shopping list is subtracted to reflect the remaining amount to be bought.
****
**_Important Note_**: This command cannot be undone/redone.
