Using a combination of thematic and chronological approaches, it will focus on the themes of colonialism and resistance. Some of the key issues to be discussed would include the way the British constructed knowledge about India, Indian responses to colonial rule, the coming of mass nationalism, the communal divide and events leading to decolonization and partition. No prior background in Indian History is required for students to study this module.",
