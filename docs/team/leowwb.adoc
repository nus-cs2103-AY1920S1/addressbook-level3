== Introduction
This document details the various contributions that I have made to my team project, _KeyboardFlashCards_ (KFC). Done as part of a second-year software engineering module,
the project requires that students work in teams to morph a desktop addressbook application into another product. The
project is required to conform to a number of constraints, the most significant being that the product must primarily utilize a CLI (command-line interface); this
means that the primary means of user input to the product must be through the typing of commands.

This project was the result of six weeks of hard work by my team, which comprises two final-year Computer Engineering students and three sophomore Computer Science
students (including myself). All are students in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Our final product is _KeyboardFlashCards_ - a desktop flashcard manager application targeted at
computing students (in particular, NUS School of Computing students), who will be able to use it to
enhance their learning experience. It does this by simulating a real deck of flashcards on the user's
computer, complete with features including creation, editing, deletion, revision, and sharing of
flashcards. The application is written in the Java programming language, and has an approximate 25 KLoC
(for comparison, the original addressbook application had about 10 KLoC).

Here is a screenshot of our project:

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section is a summary of the contributions I have made to the team project. It includes code, documentation, and other types of helpful contributions._
|===

* *Major enhancement #1*: I added the ability to *export flashcards to various file formats*.
** What it does: It allows the user to save their flashcards from the application into a specified external file.
    The file format can be either '.docx' or '.json', and is inferred from the file extension specified by the user.
    To avoid clutter, any data that would only be relevant in the context of the application (e.g. a user-given rating)
    is not exported with the flashcards.
** Justification: This feature greatly improves the application. The ability to export flashcards
    means that the user can easily generate cheat sheets (by exporting to a document file),
    or share flashcards with others (by exporting to a JSON file) - all through the convenience of a single command.
** Highlights: This enhancement was designed in such a way as to maximize extensibility in the future
    (if a future developer ever wishes to add support for more file formats). It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
    The implementation was challenging due to the dependence on an external library,
    as well as the tendency of certain file paths to break our user input parser.
** Credits: All writing of flashcards to the '.docx' and '.json' formats is done with the use of two external libraries;
    these are Apache POI and Jackson, respectively.

* *Major enhancement #2*: I added the ability to *import flashcards from an external file*.
** What it does: It allows the user to import flashcards from a JSON file (a file that ends in '.json').
    The imported flashcards are added to the application, and the user will be able to use them as if they were their own.
** Justification: This feature, when used in combination with the Export feature, allows users to share their flashcards with
    one another.
** Highlights: This feature does not import flashcards which the user already has. This is because
    there's no good reason for the user to have two copies of the same flashcard.
    The user will be notified if a duplicate is detected in a file while importing.
** Credits: All reading of flashcards from the '.json' format is done with the use of Jackson, an external library.
