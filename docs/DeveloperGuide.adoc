== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`PersonListPanel`, `Page` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

Overall, the `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[page_api]]
==== Page API
The `Page` `UiPart`, as contained by `MainWindow`, is the key component that reflects the differences
in the data displayed across different pages of the application.

Each class extending `Page` is able to implement its various components and root JavaFX node types
separately, allowing for much flexibility in terms of the different user interfaces of the pages.

Due to its flexibility, the `Page` abstract class is mainly only responsible for :

1. Providing its child classes with the supporting
instances of `Model` and `MainWindow` in order to,
** populate the classes' components with data
** execute commands from the user interface, outside of the `CommandBox` (e.g. an _add_ button).
2. Providing a way to execute any callback function (such as one to update display data),
through use of the abstract method `fillPage`. The `fillPage` method is registered inside
`MainWindow`, such that it runs after each command execution.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== [Itinerary] Edit trip/day/event feature
==== Aspect: Model
Editing of trip/day/event can be accessed from `TripsPage/DaysPage/EventsPage` respectively. The
The execution of commands in the each page is facilitated by `TripManagerParser/DayViewParser/EventViewParser` and respectively.
They extends from `PageParser` class which serves as the abstraction for all parsers related to each __Page__.

The operations are exposed to the `Model` interface through the `Model#getPageStatus()`
method that returns the `PageStatus` containing the current state of application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the program behaves at each step.

Step 1. When the user launches the application. The `PageStatus` is initialized under along with other `Model` components. `PageStatus` at launch does not contain any `EditTripDescriptor/EditDayDescriptor/EditEventDescriptor` responsible for storing information for the edit.

image::ItineraryEdit0.png[]

Step 2. The user currently on the `TripsPage/DaysPage/EventsPage` is displayed a list of `Trip/Day/Event` respectively. The user executes the edit command `EDIT1` using the `OneBasedIndex` on the list to edit it.This executes the `EnterEditTripFieldCommand/EnterEditDayFieldCommand/EnterEditEventFieldCommand` that initializes a new descriptor within `PageStatus` before switching over to the `EditTripPage/EditDayPage/EditEventPage` containing to perform the editing.

image::ItineraryEdit1.png[]

Step 3. The user is now on the edit page displaying a list of fields that the user can edit in the `Trip/Day/Event`.
The following is an example list of commands available in `DaysPage` and the execution of the program when a field is edited in `DaysPage`:

* `edit n/<name> ds/<startDate> de/<endDate> b/<totalBudget> l/<destination> d/<description>` - Edits the relevant fields
* `done` - Completes the edit and returns to the __Overall View__
* `cancel` - Discards the edit and returns to the __Overall View__

The user executes the command `edit n/EditedName` on the `DaysPage`. The command creates a new descriptor from the contents of the original, replacing the fields only if they are edited. The new descriptor is then assigned to `PageStatus` replacing the original `EditDayDescriptor`. The result of the edit is then displayed to the user.

image::ItineraryEdit2.png[]

Step 4. The user has completed editing the `Trip/Day/Event` and executes `done`/`cancel` to confirm/discard the edit. The execution of the two cases are as follows:

* The user executes `done` to confirm the edit. This executes the `DoneEditTripCommand/DoneEditDayCommand/DoneEditEventCommand` and a `Trip/Day/Event` is built from the descriptor respective to the type it describes. `DayList#set(target, edited)` proceeds to be executed which accesses the `Day` to edit from the `day` field in `PageStatus` as the target. The method replaces the original day with the newly built day from the descriptor. The descriptor in `PageStatus` is then reset to contain empty fields.

image::ItineraryEdit3.png[]

* The User executes `cancel` to discard the edit. This executes the `CancelEditTripCommand/CancelEditDayCommand/CancelEditEventCommand` which resets the descriptor in `PageStatus` to contain all empty fields.

image::ItineraryEdit4.png[]

Upon completion of the edit, the user is returned to the `TripPage/DaysPage/EventsPage` depending on where the user entered the edit page from.

Below is an sequence diagram illustrating the execution of the command "edit ds/10/10/2019":

image::ItineraryEditSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Aspect: User Interface
The UI for to edit fields are associated with the `EditTripPage/EditDayPage/EditEventPage` respectively.

image::EditTripPageClassDiagram.png[title="Class diagram showing EditTripPage's associations"]

The diagram above shows the `EditTripPage` of the 3 pages and how it displays its contents. All the pages extend the `Page` class and contains several `FormItems`. These pages classes can also navigate to the `Model` and `Logic` interfaces through the `ModelManager` and `LogicManager` class respectively.

The `FormItems` (e.g. `DateFormItem`) are instantiated by the `EditTripPage#initFormWithModel` method called by the constructor of `EditTripPage` . Each `FormItem` contains an `executeChangeHandler` that executes whenever the `onChange` property is modified by the user. These are initialized as execution of the various edit commands (e.g. EditTripFieldCommand/EditDayFieldCommand/EditEventFieldCommand) using the value in the `FormItem`.

The contents of the fields are updated by the execution to the commands above. When the user edits any of the `FormItems`, the commands are executed which will cause the `EditTripPage/EditDayPage/EditEventPage#fillPage()` to execute again. `fillPage` retrieves the updated fields from `PageStatus` and displays them as the values in the `FormItems`.

=== Aspect: Workflow of execution
The logic of editing a field and committing it to memory is a simple process of validating each field. If any field fails to meet the specifications, the `Trip/Day/Event` will not be created/edited. Below is an example execution of validating the edit:

image::EditTripPageActivityDiagram.png[title="Execution of the done command on any edit page"]

=== [Itinerary] Delete Trip/Day/Event
==== Implementation
Deletion of `Trip/Day/Event` is facilitated by `PageStatus`. `PageStatus` stores the current state of execution of the user program.
Upon initial startup of the program `Model` is initialized with `PageStatus` with the `PageType` set to enum `PageType#TRIP_MANAGER`. This indicates the current page displayed to the user. `PageStatus` is initialized with empty references to the `Trip/Day/Event` the user executes an action for.

Step 1. When the user launches the application. `PageStatus` is initialized along with other `Model` components with empty references.

image::ItineraryDelete0.png[]

Step 2. The user enters the `DaysPage/EventsPage` using the goto command. This instantiates a new `PageStatus` object from the the existing `PageStatus` with a modified `Day/Trip`, providing the context for subsequent actions. Below is an example execution of the command:

image::ItineraryDelete1.png[]

Step 3. The user is now on the `TripManager/DaysPage/EventsPage`, the user can execute the `delete` command in accordance to the display ordered index on any of the aforementioned pages.

When the command `delete <index>` is executed, `DeleteTripCommand/DeleteDayCommand/DeleteEventCommand` is executed. This command accesses `Trip/Day` reference in `PageStatus` assigned by the previous step. (Note: deleting `Trips` do not require `PageStatus`, it being directly accessible to `Model` using `TripList` accessors).

The `Day/Trip` reference contains the list of `Events/Days` in memory respectively (`DayList/EventList`). `DayList#remove/EventList#remove` are methods in the respective list classes used to delete the day/event. These are executed, modifying the in memory `TravelPal` and `Trip/Event/Day` is removed.

image::ItineraryDelete2.png[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Diary] Photo Manager
The photo manager pertains to components for storing, and displaying user specified photos on the disk.

[[photo_model]]
==== Aspect : Model

[[diary_photo_model_class_diagram]]
image::diary/DiaryPhotoModelClassDiagram.png[]

===== Photo
The model for a photo stored in memory is stored in the `Photo` class.

It contains three key fields, that is, the `imagePath`, `description`, and `dateTaken` fields which are used to display key information of the image to the user.
The `imagePath` and `dateTaken` were implemented respectively with the robust java apis of `Path` and `LocalDateTime`, while `description` is simply a `String`.

In addition, a JavaFX `Image` is also stored inside the photo (not shown in <<diary_photo_model_class_diagram>> for brevity),
which holds the `Image` to use for displaying in an `ImageView` inside the user interface. The `Image` is cached this way,
as the `Image` construction directly in the user interface involves costly I/O operations.


===== PhotoList
On the other hand, the `Photo` models are contained within a `PhotoList`. It stores the photos in a JavaFX `ObservableList`,
so that changes are registered with the user interface. (see <<photo_manager_ui>>)

It also supports several convenience wrapper methods around the underlying `ObservableList`, tailored for use for the logic components.

'''

====== Restrictions on fields during `Photo` instance construction:

* Several restrictions on the description are enforced by class level `Pattern` matchers, such as the length of the description.
* While the image file path is parsed and checked using the java `Files` api, it is non-strict in that a path to an invalid image will result in the `Image` field referring to the default class level variable that specifies a placeholder image.
** However, the original user entered file path is still stored inside the Model, to guard against accidental file deletion.



[[photo_manager_ui]]
==== Aspect : User interface of photo manager

The main `UiPart` component that displays photos is the `DiaryGallery`.
It abides by the `Page` implementation (see <<page_api>>), and is thus contained within
in one of `DiaryPage's` placeholders.

image::diary/DiaryPhotoUiObjectDiagram.png[title="Diary gallery component object diagram"]

The `DiaryGallery` contains a `PhotoList`, with which it uses to populate its `ListView<Photo>` component.

The ListView uses a small, clean custom cell factory, which sets the `cells` of the `ListView` to use `DiaryGalleryCards`
as its graphic, generated via the `ListCell` index and the `Photo` item.

`DiaryGalleryCards` display the information in the `Photo` model supplied with a series of `Labels` and one `ImageView`.
Additionally, the index of the card as displayed in the `DiaryGallery` is also displayed, but not stored in the model.

==== Aspect : Logic of photos
The logic for photo manager plays to the same `PageParser` structure of parsing commands, that is,
`DiaryParser` returns either `AddPhotoParser`, `DeletePhotoParser` when the appropriate command word is parsed, which
in turn returns instances of `AddPhotoCommand` and `DeletePhotoCommand` respectively.


===== Aspect : Adding photos (through command line file path or os file chooser)

Following `DiaryParser` returning an instance of `AddPhotoParser` that calls `parse()` on the user specified arguments,
a number of operations happen, as per the UML sequence diagram below (<<AddPhotoParser parse sequence diagram>>). The specifics of `getFilePath`,
`parseDescription`, `parseDateTime` are detailed further down below. ()
[AddPhotoParser parse sequence diagram]
image::diary/DiaryAddPhotoParser.png[title="Sequence diagram of the parse method in AddPhotoParser"]

'''

====== Parsing the image file path [[adding_photo_diary_step_1]]

** Using `ArgumentMultimap`, the file chooser prefix, "fc/", is checked for.
If present, the OS file choosing gui is opened using `ImageChooser` (a simple extension of JavaFX's `FileChooser` enforcing image file extensions), and the data file path prefix is ignored.
** Otherwise, the presence of the data file prefix is checked, and its subsequent argument is validated
as a valid image file.
** If the file chooser prefix is unspecified and the data file path is invalid, `AddPhotoParser` throws a `ParseException`

image::diary/AddPhotoParserGetFilePathActivityDiagram.png[title="Activity diagram of getFilePath subroutine"]

'''

====== Parsing the description
** If the description prefix is present, `AddPhotoParser` tries to construct the `Photo` instance with the specified input.
If validation of the description, as described in the <<photo_model>> fails, then a ParseException is thrown during the instance construction.
** Otherwise, the file name of the validated file from <<adding_photo_diary_step_1>> (truncated to match `Photo's` description constraints) is used.

image::diary/AddPhotoParserParseDescriptionActivityDiagram.png[title="Activity diagram of parseDescription subroutine"]

'''

====== Parsing the date of the photo
* If the date time prefix is present, `ParserDateUtil` is used to parse the date time as per the app level date formats.
A `ParseException` is automatically thrown in the case of date parsing failure, by `ParserDateUtil`.
* Otherwise, the last modified date of the validated file from <<adding_photo_diary_step_1>> is used.

'''

The `Photo` instance is then constructed, and passed to `AddPhotoCommand` which simply adds the `Photo` to the
current `PhotoList` of the `DiaryEntry`.


===== Aspect : Deleting photos
Following `DiaryParser` parsing the 'delphoto' command from the user, an instance of `DeletePhotoParser` is created, which parses the received arguments.

1. The `DeletePhotoParser` simply parses the arguments for a valid integer, failing which a `ParseException` is thrown.
2. An instance of `DeletePhotoCommand` is returned, which attempts a delete operation on the current `PhotoList` of the
`DiaryEntry` with the specified index. A `CommandException` is thrown to alert the user if the index was out of bounds.


==== Design considerations
[width="100%", options="header" cols="1, 4, 4"]
|========================================================================================
|Feature      |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Validation of image file path
|The first option is to implement the file path validation directly inside the `Photo` model.

This would have enforced a stricter level of validation on the image file path throughout the code,
if an instance of `Photo` needed to be instantiated somewhere else other than the `AddPhotoParser` for future use.

However, since the storage model for `Photo` (which is `JsonAdaptedPhoto`), initializes the model
through deserializing the saved file path, this would have led to needing to a separate constructor for `Photo`
in the case that the file path was invalidated on app startup in order to create a placeholder image.
|The second, chosen option, was to implement the file path validation inside the parser itself.

Although this option limited the validation to only the 'addphoto' command, it allowed for leeway in
image path validation in other areas such as `JsonAdaptedPhoto`, where it is possible for deletion of an
image file by the user, outside of the application, to invalidate the stored file path and erroneous data to be loaded on application start.

Moreover, Since the function for parsing the image file can and was abstracted into a single utility function,
any other areas in future development needing this functionality can simply reuse this code.

Overall, this leads to a more robust behaviour of the application, while providing the same level of
extensibility as the first option.

|========================================================================================
// end::diary_ppp[]
=== [Diary] Diary Entry Text Editing
The diary entry is capable of displaying text with inline images, or lines consisting of only images.

There are two primary facets of input styles to this feature, one being commands that edits
a part or the whole of the entry through the command line input, and the other being the JavaFX text editor.

[[diary_text_editing_model]]
==== Aspect : Models
The main model abstraction holding the data of an entry is the `DiaryEntry` class. +

It stores three key fields, namely: +
1. An `Index` denoting the day the entry is for +
2. A `String` written by the user in the domain specific language (see <<diary-entry-parsing>>) required by the user interface. +
3. A `PhotoList` storing the photos of the entry, as described in <<photo_model>>.

The `DiaryEntry` models are contained within a `DiaryEntryList`, which enforces the uniqueness of the `Index` (denoting the day index)
of each `DiaryEntry`, and supports common list operations.

image::diary/DiaryModelClassDiagram.png[title="Class diagram of the models used in diary text editing"]

'''

As one of the desired specifications of our application was to allow the user commands, and edits made directly to the edit box
to be non final until the `done` command is executed, a separate buffer model, `EditDiaryEntryDescriptor`, was needed to store the edit information.

This buffer model stores the same `PhotoList` and `Index` as the initial `DiaryEntry` it is constructed from,
but the diary text references a different String, that is, the buffered diary text String.

[[diary-entry-ui]]
==== Aspect : User interface
The diary entry UI abides by the `DiaryPage` implementation, and is thus contained within in one
of its placeholders as a `UiPart`.

[[diary-entry-ui-class-diagram]]
image::diary/DiaryUiClassDiagram.png[title="Class diagram showing the user interface of the main diary entry text display"]

NOTE: In the diagram above, all parts and subparts of the composition of `DiaryPage` extend from `UiPart`, although not shown.

The `DiaryEntryDisplay` is the component responsible for displaying the content of the `DiaryEntry` model.
Internally, it uses a JavaFX `ListView<CharSequence>` with a custom cell factory that
returns `DiaryTextLineCell` (as detailed in <<DiaryTextLineCell_details>>), which uses the `DiaryLine` `UiPart` as its graphic.

[[diary-entry-parsing]]
===== Entry text parsing
In both facets of input styles, special entry text parsing is required to display the various formats of lines, and
dynamic text updates that occur when the text in the text editor is changed should propagate to the display immediately.

To accomplish this, the internal `ListView` is set to observe the paragraphs of the `DiaryEditBox`, which is done in the
constructor of `DiaryEntryDisplay` in the initialisation of `DiaryPage`.

The two facets of inputs dictate _two separate ways the paragraphs can change_.



====== 1. Changes as a result of edits by the user in the text edit box

In this case, the edits to the `TextArea` input in `DiaryEditBox` are immediately propagated to the observable paragraphs, since the
`ListView` was set to observe the same list provided by `DiaryEditBox`.

====== 2. Changes as a result of user commands
[[DiaryPageFillPage]]
image::diary/DiaryFillPageCallbackTrimmed.png[title = "Sequence diagram of updating of DiaryPage UI post command execution"]

1. The `model` is updated, depending on whether the edit box is currently shown to the user. +
1.1. The edited but uncommitted text stored in the current `EditDiaryEntryDescriptor` will be updated
if the edit box is shown. (second branch in the diagram <<DiaryPageFillPage>>) +
1.2. Otherwise, the current `DiaryEntry` in the `PageStatus` of the `model` is updated immediately.
(first branch in the diagram <<DiaryPageFillPage>>)
2. The text in the `DiaryEntryEditBox` is then refreshed with the updated `model` in the `fillPage`
callback function executed by `MainWindow` (as per the `Page` api), resulting in the changes
reflecting in the observable paragraphs.

'''

[[DiaryTextLineCell_details]]
====== Graphic of `ListView` cells in `DiaryEntryDisplay`
The `ListView` of `DiaryEntryDisplay` uses a custom cell factory and cell implementation, that is, `DiaryTextLineCell`.

Once the data has been updated in the above two ways, the `ListView` receives the notification for which cell(s) to update.

The parsing is done in the inner class `DiaryTextLineCell` based on the text line received, using a
customised regex pattern. `DiaryTextLineCell` then creates new instances of `DiaryLines`
based on the parsed input, setting them as the `graphic` for the `ListCell`.

NOTE: For `DiaryLines` with photos, the parsing process uses the photoList as set in the `DiaryPage's`
`fillPage` method. (see branch 1 in <<DiaryPageFillPage>>)

==== Design considerations
Numerous design decisions and comprimised had to be made due to the desired specifications of text editing and displaying. +
Specifically, the following had to be achieved :

* Changes to text in the `DiaryEntryEditBox` must reflect immediately in the `DiaryEntryDisplay` to provide visual cue to the user.
* While the `DiaryEntryEditBox` is active, commands that edit the entry must behave like they edit the `DiaryEntryEditBox` directly.
That is, the changes should not be committed immediately.
* In general, where mentioned below, performance was favoured because of how a singular diary line can present both
multimedia and text to the user, which puts considerable strain on the system than other areas of the application.

|========================================================================================
|Aspect      |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2 | Chosen option
|Updating of UI
|The first option was to abide by the `fillPage` api of `Page`. The `ListView` would have all its items cleared and updated
with the new text after each command execution.

However, this implies updating all `DiaryLineTextCell` inside the list view after each command execution, which puts a clear
burden on the system, and defeats the intended way `ListView` is to be used (as specified in JavaFX documentation).

**Alternative 2** attempts to solve this performance bottleneck.

|The second option, was to implement the diary text in `DiaryEntry model` (see <<diary_text_editing_model>>) using an `ObservableList` of
strings. The `ListView` would then be set to observe this list, and when the current entry changed, a new `DiaryEntryDisplay`
would be created (as `ListView` does not support changing the `ObservableList` instance after setting it).

For user commands, this solves the problem posed by **alternative 1**, since user commands can make edits only where needed in
the `ObservableList`, allowing the `ListView` to only update the relevant `DiaryLineTextCell`.

However, this meant that user edits to the `DiaryEntryEditBox` could not be reflected directly to the `DiaryEntryDisplay`.

Hence, one solution was to add a separate listener to the `ObservableList` of `DiaryEntryEditBox`, executing a UI initiated command that
edited only a specific line of text inside the `DiaryEntry model` pertaining to the edited text paragraph. +
Subsequent iterations of development and testing showed that this erased the performance benefit of implementing the observable list,
presumably due to the overhead of firing commands whenever the text in the `DiaryEntryEditBox` changed.

|
The last option was to set the `ListView` to only observe `ObservableList` of paragraphs already
provided by the `TextArea` JavaFX component located in `DiaryEntryEditBox`.

Edits to the paragraphs in the `DiaryEntryEditBox` would be directly reflected in the
`DiaryEntryDisplay`.

On the other hand, edits using commands would reflect in the UI through setting the text
of the `DiaryEntryEditBox`.

A hybrid solution built upon **alternatives 2 and 3** was also proposed, in that two
`DiaryEntryDisplay` s would be maintained, one observing the `DiaryEntryEditBox`
and the other observing the `DiaryEntry model`. However, this also proved to be costly, as it
required maintaining two list views in memory. Moreover, the two `ListViews` would have to be
alternated into and out of the JavaFX node tree whenever the user switched to and
fro the `DiaryEntryEditBox`, causing a noticeable delay.

Having considered the performance impacts of **alternatives 1 and 2**, and the desired
specifications of the application, the chosen solution was **alternative 3**.


|High level composition of `DiaryEntryDisplay` component

|The first solution to was to make `DiaryEntryDisplay` hold a JavaFX `TextFlow` component, which
supports displaying images alongside text.

Although it supports various apis to format and position text, displaying multimedia with it required
complex parsing logic of the `DiaryEntry` text to achieve desired positioning.

Moreover, the parsing would be re run on the entire text of the `DiaryEntry` for any form of user input,
posing a clear performance downside.


|

|

The second solution is to use a wrapper (`DiaryEntryDisplay) around a `ListView` containing `DiaryLine` s. (see <<diary-entry-ui-class-diagram>>)

On one hand, this increases extensibility, as the the graphic of a `ListViewCell` (`DiaryTextLineCell`) is not fixed.
This allows _building other variants of diary lines easily_, such as a diary line containing a playable audio file.

Secondly, `ListViews` render only the visible cells on the screen. Apart from the reducing the amount of nodes loaded
in the JavaFX scene graph, it also allows running the parsing logic on only parts (paragraphs) of the text in the `DiaryEntry` model.
This results in a considerable performance benefit.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
