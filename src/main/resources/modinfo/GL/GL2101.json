    "description": "This module explores how the contemporary structure of the global system emerged. It studies how a world economy with integrated systems of production and trade emerged from interactions in which ethnic, national, political, and cultural divisions played a crucial role. It also examines the mechanisms though which Europeans and European culture maintained a dominant place through conflicts and crises from the sixteenth century onwards. The period under investigation runs from the Thirteenth Century to the start of the Twentieth.",
