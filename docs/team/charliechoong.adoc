== PROJECT: DeliveryMANS

---

== Introduction

*DeliveryMANS* is a food delivery management system primarily for administrators in food delivery centres to effectively manage their delivery services. This necessitates
the need to manage 4 different aspects which are food orders, deliverymen, restaurants as well as customers. To accommodate more efficient management of these aspects, *DeliveryMANS* has 4
different in-built interfaces(also known formally as contexts): *universal*/*order*, *deliverymen*, *restaurant*, and *customer*.
The user primarily interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

This is what our project looks like in the case of the deliverymen context:

My role was to design and write the codes for the context for the deliverymen side. This comprises all the features to manage deliverymen status as well as computing crucial
statistics regarding their status.

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to
the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature*: implemented *the ability to analyse and compute relevant statistics regarding deliverymen status*
** What it does: allows the user to have a quick summary of the current state of his deliverymen
** Justification: This feature allows the user to have a quick overview of the state of his manpower with a simple command so that he can be aware of any potential shortage of deliverymen.
** Highlights: This enhancement has high development potential in future when the app is further enhanced as the statistics can begin to employ predictive capabilities with regards to demand over the next few weeks.

* *Major feature*: implemented *the management of deliverymen and their status*
** What it does: allows the user to easily manipulate the list of deliverymen as well as updating their respective status
** Justification: This feature allows for efficient management of deliverymen and convenient navigation of the lists of deliverymen through the status buttons as well as unique colors to denote different status.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives for the deliverymen interface. The implementation for the color change and buttons was challenging as it required an excellent knowledge in JavaFX.

* *Minor enhancement*: integrated *the updating of deliverymen status into other contexts*
** What it does: allows all the relevant commands in all contexts to make necessary updates to the deliverymen status
** Justification: This enhancement ensures the updating of deliverymen status are well-integrated into all the commands from the four contexts.
** Highlights: This enhancement will always be necessary as long as there are new commands or features that are added in future that are related to deliverymen status.
