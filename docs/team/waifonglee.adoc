== PROJECT: Billboard

---

== Introduction
This page will document my overall contributions to the Software Engineering Project, _Billboard_.

=== About Billboard
For our Software Engineering Project, my team of 5 were tasked with enhancing a desktop addressbook application. With students as our target users, we decided to morph it into a personal financial management system called _Billboard_.
_Billboard_ enables students to track and manage their expenses in an intuitive and convenient way. With features like tagging and archiving, students are able to manage and organise their expenses. Similarly,
features like viewing statistical graphs of their recent expenditure and advanced search functions allows them to track their expenses. +

_Billboard_ is a Command Line Interface(CLI) desktop application, meaning that it is catered for students who prefer typing as all interactions between users and the application is through typing.
For more user friendliness, _Billboard_ has a Graphical User Interface(GUI). +

This is what _Billboard_ looks like: +

My role was to design and implement features related to tagging. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation i have added to the user and developer guides in relation to them. +

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates important information +

`tag` - A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

`*UniqueTagList*` - A grey highlight (called a mark-up) with bold text indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

"_tech_" - Italicised text with quotation marks indicates the name of an expense or tag.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to _Billboard_. +

* *Major enhancement*: i added features related to tagging. +
** *What it does*: This enhancement allows users to add and remove tags from an expense. Users can also list out existing tags and filter their expenses by tags.
** *Justifications*: Tagging allows for easier management of expenses. Expenses with the same tags are grouped together which allows users to search for related expenses quickly.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary since there are many ways to implement this enhancement, each with its own pros and cons in terms of efficiency or space allocation in the application.
The current design is used to ensure there is a balance between space allocation and efficiency of the application.

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the original addressbook User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added.
The following is an excerpt from *_Billboard User Guide_*, showing additions that I have made for the tag features. +
Note that examples and diagrams for `tag list` and `tag filter` are omitted due to space constraints.

=== Tagging expenses: `tag`
This feature allows you to assign tags to your expenses. Expenses with the same tag will be grouped together, allowing you to search for related expenses easily.

[NOTE]
Tag names should be *alphanumeric*. This means that they should not contain spaces or special characters. +
Tag names are *case sensitive.* +
You are *not* able to use this feature on *archived expenses*.

To view a list of supported tag commands, you could type `tag` in the command box and press `enter`. +
Similarly, to view parameters for supported tag commands, you could type `tag` followed by the supported tag command and press `enter`. +
Example: `tag rm`

==== Adding a tag: `tag add` +
This command adds your input tag(s) to the expense at the index you have specified. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 tag add [INDEX] t/[TAG] t/[TAG…]

Example: +
Lets say that you want to add the tags "_holiday_" and "_hangout_" to the expense "_USS_" at index 2. +
{nbsp} +
To add the tags: +
1. Type `tag add 2 t/holiday t/hangout` in the command box and press `enter` to execute it. +
image:tagging/AddTagOne.png[] +
2. The result box will display the message "Added tag(s) to Expense: +
Name: USS Description:  Amount: 70.00 Created: 13 Apr 2019, 11:23 PM Archive Name:  Tags: [[hangout], [holiday]]" +
{nbsp} +
image:tagging/AddTagTwo.png[] +
{nbsp} +
3. You could see the tags "_holiday_" and "_hangout_" in the expense at index 2. +
{nbsp} +
image:tagging/AddTagThreeCropped.png[] +
{nbsp} +

[NOTE]
You are not able to add *existing* tags. +
If you input *existing* and *non-existing* tags, Billboard adds the *non-existing* tags only. +
If you input *duplicate* tags, Billboard adds them *once*. i.e Billboard does *not* allow duplicate tags in an expense. +
Example: `tag add t/holiday t/holiday`

==== Removing a tag: `tag rm` +
This command removes your input tag(s) from the expense at the index you have specified. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 tag rm [INDEX] t/[TAG] t/[TAG…]

Example: +
Lets say that you want to remove the tags "_holiday_" and "_hangout_" from the expense "_USS_" at index 2. +
To remove the tags: +
1. Type `tag rm 2 t/holiday t/hangout` in the command box and press `enter` to execute it. +
{nbsp} +
image:tagging/rmTagOne.png[] +
{nbsp} +
2. The result box will display the message "Removed tag(s) from Expense: +
 Name: USS Description:  Amount: 70.00 Created: 13 Apr 2019, 11:23 PM Archive Name:  Tags: []" +
{nbsp} +
image:tagging/rmTagTwo.png[] +
{nbsp} +
3. You could see that the expense at index 2 no longer has the tags "_hangout_" and "_holiday_". +
{nbsp} +
image:tagging/rmTagThree.png[] +
{nbsp} +

[NOTE]
You are not able to remove *non-existing* tags. +
If you input *duplicate* tags, Billboard removes them *once*. +
Example: `tag rm t/holiday t/holiday`

==== Filtering by tag: `tag filter` +
This command filters expenses by your input tag(s). +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 tag filter t/[TAG] t/[TAG…]

==== Listing out all the tags: `tag list` +
This command lists out all existing tags. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 tag list

== Contributions to Developer Guide
We had to update the original addressbook Developer Guide with instructions for the enhancements that we had added.
The following is an excerpt from *_Billboard Developer Guide_*, showing additions that I have made for the tag features. +

=== Tagging
==== Proposed Implementation
The tag feature supports the following operations:

* Adding tags to an expense
* Removing tags from an expense
* Filtering expenses by tags
* Listing all existing tags

These actions are facilitated by the `*UniqueTagList*` and `*TagCountManager*` classes:

* `*UniqueTagList*` maps `*String*` to `*Tag*` where `*String*` is the name of the `*Tag*`. It ensures that the same `*Tag*` object is referenced instead of creating many `*Tag*` objects of the same name during operations.
* `*TagCountManager*` maps `*Tag*` to `*Integer*`, where `*Integer*` is the number of `*Expense*` tagged with each `*Tag*`. It allows `*Tag*` objects that are not tagged with any `*Expense*` to be tracked and removed.

Operations include:

* `*UniqueTagList#retrieveTags(List<String>)*` -- Retrieves corresponding tags from `*UniqueTagList*` based on the list of tag names.
* `*UniqueTagList#removeAll(List<Tag>)*` -- Removes tags given in the list from the `*UniqueTagList*`.
* `*UniqueTagList#getTagNames()*` -- Returns a list of existing tag names.
* `*TagCountManager#incrementAllCount(Set<Tag>)*` -- Increments the `*Integer*` mapped to the tags in the set by 1.
* `*TagCountManager#decreaseAllCount(Set<Tag>)*` -- Decreases the `*Integer*` mapped to the tags in the set by 1.
* `*TagCountManager#removeZeroCount()*` -- Removes all mappings where the `*Integer*` is equal to 0.

These operations are exposed in the `*Model*` interface as:

* `*Model#retrieveTags(List<String>)*`
* `*Model#incrementCount(Set<Tag>)*`
* `*Model#decreaseCount(Set<Tag>)*` -- `*TagCountManager#removeZeroCount()*` and `*UniqueTagList#removeAll(List<Tag>)*` are called in this method to remove any tag not tagged to any expense from the `*UniqueTagList*` and `*TagCountManager*`.
* `*Model#getTagNames()*`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how adding tag executes at every step.

* **Step 1:**
The user launches the application. The `*Model*` is initialized with saved data. All tags are loaded into `*UniqueTagList*` and `*TagCountManager*`.

* **Step 2:**
User enters the command `tag add 1 t/test t/test2` to add tags to the `*Expense*` at index 1 in Billboard. +
*2a*. `*BillboardParser*` parses this command, creating a `*TagCommandParser*` after determining that it is a tag command. +
*2b*. The `*TagCommandParser*` then parses `add 1 t/test t/test2` and creates an `*AddTagCommandParser*` after determining that it is a command to add tags. +
*2c*. Subsequently, the `*AddTagCommandParser*` parses `1 t/test1 t/test2` into `*Index*` 1 and
a list of `*String*` consisting of `test1` and `test2`. `*AddTagCommandParser*` creates `*AddTagCommand*` with the `*Index*` and list of `*String*` as parameters.

* **Step 3:**
`*LogicManager*` executes the `*AddTagCommand*`. +
During execution, +
*3a*. `*AddTagCommand*` calls `*Model#retrieveTags(List<String>)*` on the list of `*String*` consisting of `test1` and `test2` which returns a set of `*Tag*` with tag names `test1` and `test2`. +
*3b*. `*AddTagCommand*` then calls `*Model#incrementCount(Set<Tag>)*` on the set of `*Tag*`. +
*3c*. Lastly, `*AddTagCommand*` calls `*Model#setExpense(Expense, Expense)*` which edits and updates the `*Expense*` at index 1 in the `*Model*`. The updated `*Expense*` is then reflected on the GUI.

[NOTE]
Duplicate tags in an `*Expense*` is not allowed. +
If the user tries to add an existing `*Tag*` to an `*Expense*`, `*AddTagCommand*` throws an exception, leading to an error message. +
If the user tries to add duplicate `*Tag*`, i.e enter 2 of the same `*Tag*`, `*AddTagCommand*` adds the tag once and increments the number of expenses tagged to it by 1.

The following sequence diagram shows how the adding tag operation works.

image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `*TagCommandParser*` and `*AddTagCommandParser*` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a command to add tags to an expense.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support tag commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `*UniqueTagList*` to map tag names to `*Tag*` and `*TagCountManager*` to map `*Tag*` to number of `*Expense*` tagged to it.
** Pros:
*** Each structure has only one responsibility.
*** Fast retrieval and update of data
** Cons:
*** Requires maintenance of both structures as they need to sync with each other.
*** Retrieval of all `*Expense*` under a `*Tag*` requires filtering through the whole list of `*Expense*`.

* **Alternative 2 :** Have each `*Tag*` store a list of `*Expense*` tagged to it.
** Pros:
*** Fast retrieval of all `*Expenses*` under each `*Tag*`
** Cons:
*** Circular dependency
*** Since implementation of Billboard objects are immutable, there is a constant need to update the `*Expense*` in the list even after executing non-tag related commands.

* **Alternative 3 :** Use one map to map `*Tag*` to `*Expense*` tagged to it.
** Pros:
*** Fast retrieval of all `*Expenses*` under each `*Tag*`
** Cons:
*** Since implementation of Billboard objects are immutable, there is a constant need to update the `*Expense*` in the list even after executing non-tag related commands.
