    "description": "With a focus on Asia, this course draws on a diverse range of literatures (history, anthropology, psychology, animal activism) to provide a broad context for understanding the dynamics and conflicts between humans and animals. Southeast Asia is one of last regions in the world with extensive rain forest habitat for wild animals, but these creatures are threatened by burgeoning urbanization and agriculture. We will go beyond a focus on wildlife conservation, however, to also look at \u2018urban animals\u2019 such as pets and farm animals, and other topics which are central to life in this part of the world, and others.",
