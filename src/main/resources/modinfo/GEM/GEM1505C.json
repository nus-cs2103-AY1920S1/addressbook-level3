    "description": "The main objective is to introduce students to basic concepts leading to innovative design of structures based on observations of natural forms, shapes and functions. The students will be able to intuitively apply basic concepts to understand & appreciate the behaviour of these forms which will enable them, with some guidance, to model innovative conceptual designs of structures and subsequently fabricate them as 3D model(s). Topics covered in this module include natural forms and structures, basic structural concepts, functions, forms and strategies, requirements and how things work, forms, characteristics and performances leading to innovative conceptual design of structures and how designs can be translated to 3D objects. The final grade will be based on 100% continuous assessment involving assignments, laboratory work and projects.",
