    "description": "Technology has changed the way humans live, think and interact. New technologies that emerged over the past few decades have also changed the way that psychologists study human behaviour. This module aims to provide students with broad-based overview of social psychological theories and principles in technologically-supported social interactions. Through this module, students will also be introduced to new methodological techniques of studying social behaviour, e.g. mobile and social sensing to measure real-life behaviour, as well as state-of-the-art technology in studying behaviour in teams and organizations.",
