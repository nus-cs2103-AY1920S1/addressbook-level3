    "description": "Signaling within and between neurons provide the basis for information processing, storage and retrieval in the brain. This module will consider several fundamental aspects of neuronal signalling, including: (1) the ionic basis of membrane excitability; (2) basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission; and (3) mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and their implications for learning and memory.",
