    "description": "An ideological approach to literature is one that reads not only the primary literature--it also reads the way we read literature. An incisive statement about the necessity of such critical self-consciousness is Fredric Jameson's \"Metacommentary,\" and this essay will guide our reflections on the study of the interrelations between primary literature, criticism and reviews, and tertiary critical engagements with the issues that arise when readers become increasingly self-conscious about the values in play during any act of reading. This matter can be approached from a number of angles, and on its first run the course will concern American literary orientalism in the postwar period.",
