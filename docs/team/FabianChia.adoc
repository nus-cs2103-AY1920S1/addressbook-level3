== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing AddressBook3 - a given CLI (Command Line Interface) application into a better product.
Through the ideation phase, we decided to morph the application into the Njoy Teaching Assistant.
We aim to improve the quality of life for teachers by assisting them with daily administrative tasks
that have been traditionally resolved for years. In particular, the Njoy Teaching Assistant enables
teachers to maintain student records; set questions and quizzes for revision; while keeping track of
their schedules with an interactive timetable.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write code for the quiz features. The rest of the sections will cover the
summary of my quiz specific contributions to the codebase, the user guide and the developer guide.

== Summary of contributions

This section entails a summary of my specific enhancements, code contributions and other helpful increments towards the Njoy Teaching Assistant.

I implemented the quiz specific commands which include:

* *Creating a quiz automatically*
* *Creating a quiz manually*
* *Adding a question to a quiz*
* *Deleting a question from a quiz*
* *Listing the questions and answers for a quiz*
* *Showing only the questions or answers for a quiz*
* *Exporting a quiz to a formatted HTML file*

[[Grouping]]
I'll be sectioning the functionality into the following format:

. *Creation*
. *Editing*
. *Display*

=== Enhancements

==== Quiz Creation

* *What it does:* Users can either create quizzes automatically or manually. Regardless of either option,
users will also have to specify a quiz identifier for further storage and future operations.
Automatic-wise, users have to input the number of questions they want to be added to the quiz and
also, the type of questions to be added to the quiz. Users can choose to add mcq, open ended or
both types of questions to their quiz. Manual-wise, users have to input the specific question
indexes of questions in the question bank that they want to be added to the quiz.

* *Justification:* Teachers have an inherent need to prepare homework, revision papers and exam papers for
their students. As such, the NJoy Assistant provides a way for them to continuously store questions in a
database and generate quizzes based off that. They can either automate and randomise the process by specifying
the number of questions, or even create tailored quizzes by specifying the question number indexes.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The implementation for this
feature was relatively challenging because of the automation option when creating quizzes. Users have to specify
the number of questions they want to be included in a quiz and if the question bank does not contain enough
questions then the command would not go through and would prompt the user with an error stating that there are
insufficient questions in the question bank for the number that was specified. The hardest part was to make sure
that no repeated questions were added to the quiz which involved keeping track of what questions have already been
added.

==== Quiz Editing

* *What it does:* Users can choose to edit their quizzes after creation. This includes the addition of specific questions
in the question bank, or even the deletion of specific questions from the quiz. All the user has to do is to
specify the correct indexes of the questions to add or remove and the application will handle the rest. For the adding
of questions, users can also choose to specify the quiz question index that the question should be added to. For example,
if I had a quiz with question 1, 2 and 3, and I want to add a question to question 2 - I can specify just that. Question
1 would remain in the same index, question 2 would be the new question that was added, and the old question 2 and 3 would
then be shifted down to the new question 3 and 4 indexes.

* *Justification:* Even after creating a quiz, teachers might still want to add new questions or even delete questions
that they later realise were incorrect or were not supposed to be in the quiz. This is because though the
NJoy Assistant already accounts for repeated questions or wrongful answers (an mcq answer not being present in
the options), it does not ensure the correctness of questions and answers. For example, a question could be: What is
1 + 1? And the answer specified by the teacher could be 3. The Njoy Assistant would have no measures to
prevent the question from being created and hence from being added to the quiz. As such, upon the detection
of such errors, the teacher might then choose to delete the question from the quiz, then deleting it from the
question bank itself.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The implementation for this
feature was relatively challenging because of the adding questions feature. This is because we ensure that
no repeated questions can be present in a quiz - that makes no sense. A quiz should not have a repeated question,
because that would attribute to more marks given or lost depending on whether the student could have answered
the question. Before adding a question to a quiz, we make sure that it does not match any existing question in
the quiz. This ensures that the question will not be added to the quiz if it was indeed a repeat.

==== Quiz Display

* *What it does:* Users can choose to display their quizzes on the user interface after creation. There are several
display options provided: showing both questions and answers, showing only the questions and showing only
the answers. Beyond that, there is a defining feature whereby teachers can choose to display their quizzes
in an exported HTML file. Of course, the answers will not be shown on the quiz because this HTML file is
meant as a quiz for students. The questions will be formatted properly for display - mcq questions will have
radio buttons for the 4 different options, and open ended questions will have blanks for the students to fill in.
Just by specifying the quiz identifier, the user will be able to display their quizzes appropriately.

* *Justification:* The display functions serve as a confirmation of what the teacher currently has in
their quizzes. Teachers can ensure that the correct questions and answers have been allocated to their specific
quizzes before exporting them. As mentioned earlier, teachers are no stranger to the preparation of homework, assignments
and revision papers. After confirming the quiz is set up correctly, the key feature of the quiz component -
the export feature creates a HTML file in an appropriate format for their students to fill in.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The implementation for this
feature was relatively challenging because of the export quiz feature. In particular, the formatting of text
for HTML was foreign to me which is why I spent a fair bit of time understanding how to write the correct
syntax for HTML files.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users.
The following are specific portions of the NJoy Assistant's User Guide that I have selected. This is because some features are
repetitive, and as mentioned <<Grouping, `above`>> I will be grouping them into Creation, Editing and Display once again. Therefore,
I'll only show one example for each of the main features that I have written about in the user guide._

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.
Again, I'm only going to include the most relevant portions of the guide as mentioned in the <<Grouping, `above`>> citing. Also, some of
the command hyperlinks will obviously not work because I have omitted them for brevity._
