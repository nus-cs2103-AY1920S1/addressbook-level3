== Introduction

=== Software overview

*DeliveryMANs* is a command-line application designed specifically for delivery centre administrators who are in charge of food delivery service. It encompasses a well-structured system for users to keep track and manage the entire delivery process. It facilitates food delivery service by coaliasing the delivery men, customers and restaurant menu. From auto-assigning deliverymen for deliveries when orders are made, to viewing statistics of the most popular dish of restaurants as well as customer ordering trends for further promotions, financial and business management decisions, *DeliveryMANs* is everything you need to help improve managing deliveries. With just a few simple commands, this delivery manager can help to kickstart your delivery service.

=== Purpose

This document has been created to explain the software architecture and implementations of *DeliveryMANs*. The intended audience for this document are software testers and future developers.

== Setting up

To setup *DeliveryMANs* on your system, please refer to the user guide <<UserGuide#Quick-start, here>>.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

In addition, there are 4 different contexts that the App has:

* `Universal`/`Order`
* `Customer`
* `Restaurant`
* `Deliverymen`

Each context will allow the application the execute commands in the context the application is currently in. For example, `Customer` commands can only be executed in the `Customer` context. This is to allow separation between the 4 contexts, and also the 4 databases the App has. The `Universal` context will also execute commands pertaining to `Order`.

Because of this, the context are interchangeable in the diagrams below (and the one above) as changing the context will not change how the application is structured. For example, when the diagram is shown in a `Customer` context, it will also apply in a `Restaurant` context.

However, there are differences between the 4 different context that will be explained in the <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> section.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CustomerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelArchitecture_alternative_.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the customer, restaurant, deliverymen and order data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the customer, restaurant, deliverymen and order data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.deliverymans.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo feature lets users undo and redo changes to the data stored in the app, which were
effected by commands they have executed.

==== Implementation

The main class containing the states of the data in the app is `UndoHistory`. The history is
represented as a list of states. It includes the following methods:

* `notifyChange()` -- Saves the current state in the history if it is not equal to the previous
state, as defined by its `equals()` method.
* `undo()` -- Moves its internal pointer backwards and returns the previous state.
* `redo()` -- Moves its internal pointer forwards and returns the next state.

`ModelManager` contains an `UndoHistory`, and exposes its functionality via similarly named
methods. When `undo()` or `redo()` of `ModelManager` is called, it sets its own data to that
returned by the respective methods of `UndoHistory`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UndoHistory` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `current` state pointer pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. After each command, `LogicManager` calls `Model#notifyChange()`, causing the modified state of the data after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `history` list, and the `current` state pointer is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. `LogicManager` calls `Model#notifyChange()` again, causing another modified state to be saved into the `history` list.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command does not modify the data, when `UndoHistory` checks whether the current data is equal
to the data in the previous state according to its `equals()` method, it will realise that it is
indeed equal. It will then not store the state into the `history` list.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `current` state pointer once to the left, pointing it to the previous state, and restores the data to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `current` state pointer is at index 0, i.e. pointing to the initial state, then there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram1.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `current` state pointer once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the data to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `current` state pointer is at index `history.size() - 1`, i.e. pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#hasRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. If a command does not modify the data, it will not be stored in the undo history as `UndoHistory` checks for equality with the previous state. Thus, the `history` list remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#notifyChange()`. Since the `current` state pointer is not pointing at the end of the `history` list, all address book states after the `current` state pointer will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::autocomplete commands[]

=== [Proposed] Autocomplete commands feature

This is a feature which allows you to view all available commands matching the input keyword or letters, eliminating the need to memorize the commands or leave a browser tab open with the UG/DG of this application.

==== Proposed Implementation

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by the ‘KeyListener’, which will pass the current character that is being pressed on the keyboard to the trie, a tree-like abstract data type (ADT). The list of matching commands will then be passed back to the ‘Ui’ and displayed via a dropdown box below the user input command box.

For implementation of the trie, please consult ‘google’ or ‘stackoverflow’.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The current user input command box will be empty.

*insert picture of the ui at startup*

Step 2: The user wants to switch to the customer context for customer-focused commands with the command ‘customer’, however is unsure how to spell the command and types in ‘cus’. The ‘KeyListener’ will pass the characters that have been typed to the trie. The trie will then search for relevant commands and pass them as a list to the ‘Ui’, which will display the relevant results in a dropdown box below the user input command box.

*insert picture of 'cus' being typed in/ class diagram*

Step 3: The user can now complete the command he/she wants by entering the relevant command shown in the dropdown box.

*insert picture of the ui with the dropdown box*

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user types in letters into the user input command box:

*insert picture of activity diagram*

==== Design Considerations

Below are a few design considerations of the autocomplete commands feature.

===== Aspect: How autocomplete executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a ‘KeyListener’ to record and handle user inputs in the user input command box before they are entered.
** Pros: Looks nice, allows for on-the-fly display of results.
** Cons: Laborious to implement, especially in terms of debugging and troubleshooting. May also break OOP principles.
* **Alternative 2:** Handle user input only when the command is entered, utilizing the ‘Parser’ to  handle user inputs and pass it to the trie to be evaluated.
** Pros: Adheres to current flow of command executions, will not break any OOP principles.
** Cons: Tedious for the user, as the user will have to retype the whole command again. Also does not look as nice.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the autocomplete commands feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a trie to store substrings of commands as keys.
** Pros: Efficient and rapid searching, retrieving and displaying of results due to the tree-like ADT.
** Cons: Tedious to implement, tries are not currently implemented in Java, hence requires self-implementation of the ADT.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a list to store all current commands .
** Pros: Easy to implement as lists are already available in Java.
** Cons: Inefficient and slow searching, because of the need to iterate through the entire list of commands, while calling ‘.substring()’ and ‘.contains()’ methods.

// end::autocomplete commands[]
// tag::orders[]
=== Order Manager
Order Manager is an address book of Orders and has some useful functions specifically catered towards the ease of management of orders.

Firstly, the automated allocation of deliveryman once new orders are added. When a new order is created on the database, a deliveryman will be assigned to deliver the order based on whether he/she is present as well as whether he/she is currently preoccupied with delivering another order. This helps to ease the burden on the user as they would not need to manually allocate deliverymen to the orders. However, the feature to manually allocate is still present if the user wishes to do so.

Secondly, the Order Manager allows for sorting of orders, based on date, customer, restaurant, menu or even deliveryman, depending on what information the user wishes to see to allow for better management.

Additionally it implements the following operations:

* `-add_order` - adds an order to the database.
* `-edit_order` - edits an existing order in the database.
* `-delete_order` - removes an existing order in the database.

These operations are exposed in the `ModelManager` class as `ModelManager#addOrder(Order order)`, `ModelManager#setOrder(Order target, Order editedOrder)` and `ModelManager#deleteOrder(Order order)` respectively.

Order manager follows the AB3 style and implements its own 'Model', 'Command' and 'Parser' for the 'Logic Component', `JsonOrderDatabaseStorage`, `JsonSerializableOrderDatabase` and `JsonAdaptedOrder`, along with methods in the `StorageManager` for the `Storage Component` and lastly, `OrderCard` and `OrderListPanel` for displaying on the `Ui Component`.

*insert object diagrams here + brief explanation of object diagrams*

==== Implementation

**Add command:** `-add_order`

The add command adds an order to the `ModelManager` and `UniqueOrderList`. The `UniversalParser` invokes `AddOrderCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the target **customer**, **restaurant**, **food** and **quantity** from a *String* into *Name* and *Integer* objects.

Only valid **customer**, **restaurant**, **food** and **quantity** are allowed. This validation is done through accessing `UniqueCustomerList` and `UniqueRestaurantList` through `ModelManager#getFilteredCustomerList()`, `ModelManager#getFilteredRestaurantList()` and calling their respective `isValidName()` methods. **Food** validity will be checked through retrieving the respective using `Restaurant#getMenu()` and `Menu#isValidName()`.

Duplicated `Order` will be checked for using `ModelManager#hasOrder()` and is then added to the `UniqueOrderList` via `ModelManager#addOrder()`.

**Delete command:** `-delete_order`

The delete command deletes an `Order` from the `ModelManager` and `UniqueOrderList` by a specified index. The `UniversalParser` invokes `DeleteOrderCommandParser#parse()` and user input is used to get the index of the `Order` to be deleted.

==== Design Considerations

Below are a few design considerations of the Order manager class.

===== Aspect: Data structure for modelling, storage and utilization of `Order`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of existing data structures present in AB3 as reference to create new data structures needed for the implementation of a Order Manager.
** Pros: Straightforward to implement as existing references are present in 'Person' of AB3.
** Cons: Tedious to implement as several regions of the codebase needs to be edited for `Order` to run, display and save successfully.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement data structures from scratch.
** Pros: Pride and accomplishment of implementing something from scratch.
** Cons: Takes too much time to code the necessary classes.

// end::orders[]

// tag::deliverymen statistics
=== Deliverymen salary adjustment feature

This is a feature which allows the user to keep track of the deliverymen who have met the requirements for a salary increment
based on their delivery rate and duration of service. It extends DeliveryMANS with a delivery record for every deliveryman as well as relevant analysis of the record.

==== Implementation

The salary adjustment feature is primarily monitored by the 'Analyzer', which has access to the delivery record of every deliveryman in the database. From the record, the Analyzer computes two data:

* Delivery rate
** This is the number of orders per day.

* Time in database
** This is the time difference between the time when the deliveryman was added to the database and the current time when command is executed.

With these structure, it implements the following operations:

* `DeliverymenDatabase#getHistoryOf(Deliveryman index)` -- Enters the delivery record of a specified deliveryman.

* `DeliverymenDatabase#suggestPayList()` -- Obtains a list of deliverymen who are eligible for pay rise.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `suggestPayList` function works.

Step 1. Hooray! It's the time of the month for the restaurant to adjust the workers' pay. The restaurant admin, who is in charge of managing the deliverymen, types in the `paylist` command.
The command will access the `UniqueDeliverymenList` in order to obtain the list of deliverymen.

Step 2. For each deliveryman on the list, their delivery record will be analyzed.

* Time in data base: The current time will be obtained and the difference between the current time and the time of joining the database will be taken.

* Delivery rate: The number of orders completed over the time in database will be the delivery rate.

Step 3. If the delivery rate exceeds a certain threshold, the deliveryman will be added to the pay list.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user types in letters into the user input command box:

image::PayRiseSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Tracking the record of every deliveryman

This feature necessitates the tracking of the orders each deliveryman has completed.

* Alternative 1(current choice): Saves the number of completed orders for each deliveryman and write to hard disk.
** Pros: Easy to implement and takes up less memory.
** Cons: The details of the order cannot be tracked, even though they might be a potential criteria for pay rise.

* Alternative 2: Saves the specific completed orders (including the content of order) and write to hard disk.
** Pros: Allows for a thorough and more accurate analysis for suggesting pay rise
** Cons: Takes up significant amount of memory

// end::deliverymen statistics

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration
Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== EditMode
A `Restaurant` object contains many attributes. On top of a `Name`, `Location`, `Rating` and a list of `Tag`,
it also includes a list of `Food` as its menu. This makes it difficult to edit an entire `Restaurant` object
using just one `Command`. The EditMode feature allows editing of a specific `Restaurant` object's details and menu
separately under 1 mode, using different commands.

==== Implementation
* **Model**:
In addition to the `filteredRestaurantList` that contains all the restaurants in the restaurant database,
`ModelManager` now contains a `editingRestaurantList`, which contains and allows access to the restaurant
currently under EditMode. Upon calling of `editmode INDEX` command, the restaurant
referenced by the `INDEX` in the list of restaurants will be placed in the `editingRestaurantList`.
Subsequent commands that edit the restaurant, such as `addFoodCommand`, `addRatingCommand` and `editDetailsCommand`
will create a new restaurant with the edited attributes and replace the restaurant in the `editingRestaurantList`
with the new edited restaurant.

* **Logic**:
The `Logic` for EditMode is facilitated by `Context` enum type, which contains the following constants:
`GLOBAL`, `CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `DELIVERYMEN` and `EDITING`.
A different `Parser` will parse the `userInput` based on the current `Context`.

`userInput` will always be parsed by the universal parser first. If command word in userinput matches
none of the universal commands, then the context specific parser will parse it based on the context
universal parser is in, either EDITING or RESTAURANT. The reason why universal parser always parses
userinput first is because
the universal commands are supposed to be accessible in all context.

The `switch` command will change the current context to `Restaurant`, while
the `editmode` command will change the current context to `Editing`,
the `exitedit` command will exit the `Editing` context and return to the `Restaurant` context.
and commands for EditMode can only be accessed / unlocked if under `Editing` Context.

* **UI**:

Current context will be passed to `MainWindow` in the Ui package by the command result returned by the command.

Changes to the UI for EditMode is made accordingly if under `Editing` Context.
An extra StackPane showing the restaurant under EditMode will be displayed,
while the StackPane displaying the list of Restaurants originally will be filled with the
restaurant's Food menu instead.
Once `Editing` context is exited, the stackpane will be hidden, and the list of restaurants will be shown
again
