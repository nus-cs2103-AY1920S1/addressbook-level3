    "description": "Energy in Singapore depends mainly on imported fossil fuels/petroleum/natural gas. Obviously, in the quest for alternatives, future energy demand and mix, some challenges/dilemmas arise naturally in Singapore context: would nuclear energy deployment be feasible? Is wind energy a viable option? would a complete switch to solar, biofuels, and waste-to-energy technologies be possible? This module offers a systems and system dynamics approach to deal with such issues and the corresponding dynamics, dilemmas and decisions that arise while addressing them. Students gain insights into the political, socio-economic and environmental aspects of these challenges through relevant case studies/models.",
