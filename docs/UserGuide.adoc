== Introduction

We aim to streamline and gamify the process of learning words or definitions through the use of self-created flash cards.

The general flow of the program is as follows:

1. Create your word bank.
2. Add flash cards, each containing a word and a meaning, into your word bank.
3. Configure settings, or modify word bank as you wish.
4. Start the game.
5. The meaning of the card will appear and you will have to key in the answer in a given time.
6. At the end of the game, statistics of your game session appears, so you can know how well you did.
7. Revisit the word bank to beat your previous high score.

You write your own words and meaning into a word bank. You can also import a word bank given to him from a file. +
During the game, you are prompted with a meaning and you have to answer with a word. Depending on the game mode, there may also be time restrictions and hints given. Answer correctly as quickly as possible and to score as much as you can! +
You can view your statistics afterwards to review your performance! Revisit word banks which you scored badly.
