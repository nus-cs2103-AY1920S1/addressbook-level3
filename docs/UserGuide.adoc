== Introduction

Modulo is a desktop application helping National University of Singapore (NUS) students to audit their academics, finances and schedule their time as they try their best to survive yet another semester of college. Those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) might find using Modulo to be more straightforward than the usual Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. The application has the visual benefits of a GUI but stands strongly rooted in command line usage. Modulo does not require an internet connection to run so there’s no worry when the school wifi goes MIA yet again. The only time you need to be connected is at the start, when downloading the application. Look to <<Quick Start>> to find out how to get started on Modulo!

== Quick Start

.  Make sure that `Java 11` or above is installed in your computer. Otherwise, you can download Java 11 https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[here].
* Enter the follow command in Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal on Mac to check your current version of Java: `java --version`
.  Download the latest `modulo.jar` here.
.  Copy the `.jar` file to a folder you wish to set as your working directory for the application.
.  Double-click the file to start Modulo. If the GUI does not appear in a few seconds, please try running `java -jar modulo.jar` in your command prompt or terminal.

The enhanced search is case insensitive and matches any keyword in the module code or description e.g. `cs1010s` matches `CS1010S`

The search method adopts the inclusive OR search method that returns any modules with the keyword.
e.g. searching for `metho` will return `Programming Methodology I`, `Programming Methodology II`, `Web Programming and Applications`.

Format: `find MODULE_CODE [OTHER_KEYWORDS]`
e.g. `find CS1010S`, `find Programming`

==== Clear all modules in a specific semester or clean-slate all records : `clear`
Deletes all modules in the record. The user can avoid clearing modules one-by-one when large number of modules have to be cleared.

==== Mark a Borrow or Lend entry as repaid: `repaid`

Indicate that borrowed money or money lent has been returned. Note that index of log entry in list has to be of type 'borrow' or 'lend' to be successfully marked as repaid, all other log entries (i.e. 'spend', 'income') will be considered invalid. +
Once the log entry has been marked as repaid, it cannot be undone and it is no longer editable.

Any irrelevant fields to the log entry (e.g. 'Borrow' entries do not have a `<place>` field) will be ignored. +

Note that the newly-entered information will overwrite the details at the attribute. For example, if there were categories `food` and `hobby` linked to the entry at index 5 of the list, command `edit 5 <cat>pet` will delete the previous two categories and replace them with a single category `pet.` +

Repaid 'Borrow' and 'Lend' entries cannot be edited.

Note that only item description will allow for partial word matching (i.e. `cook` in `cookie` is valid), the rest will search for a full word match. This search is case-insensitive.

Filter the list of log entries by their log entry type (i.e. spend, income, borrow, lend).

At least one field has to be specified.

To return to the default full list of log entries, use the `list` command.

Format: `*find* [<type> spend/income/borrow/lend] [<keyword> KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...] [<cat> CATEGORY_NAME [MORE_CATEGORY_NAMES]...]` +
E.g. `find <type>spend`

==== Show statistical summaries of finances: `stats`

Shows an overview of the state of expenses and incomes. Log entries can be grouped by (`<gb>`) a specified attribute with either the frequency or total amount of each group summarised (`<sum>`) in a graphical display. These attributes include log entries of the same month, type, transaction method, category or place.

Both `<gb>` and `<sum>` have to be present, with combination of `ATTRIBUTE` and `STAT` specified.

Format: `*stats* <gb>ATTRIBUTE <sum>STAT` +
* Possible `ATTRIBUTE` values for `<gb>` are: `month`, `entrytype`, `met`, `cat`, `place` (only shows `Spend` entries) +
* Possible `STAT` values for `<sum>` are: `freq` and `amt` +
E.g. `stats <gb> met <sum> freq`

==== Add a budget: `budget`

Specify a budget. Budgets will only take into account the amount spent (i.e. `Spend` entries) and are generally characterised by a starting date, an ending date and a limit (maximum threshold). When total amount associated with spending crosses this limit, the budget is considered to be exceeded.

Budgets for a specific place, category or transaction method can also be set (optional). Only at most one field out of these 3 optional fields - `<met>`, `<cat>`, `<place>` - can be included to make the budget more specific. If a spend entry matches the specified field and also falls within the budget duration, it will be included in the budget tabulation. If none of these fields are indicated, the budget will sum up the amounts of *all* `Spend` entries which fall between the budget duration.

In essence, there are 3 optional fields (only at most one can be used at any time):

1. `[<met>TRANSACTION_METHOD]`
2. `[<cat>CATEGORY_NAME]`
3. `[<place>PLACE_OF_SPENDING]`

Note that these fields are case-sensitive (e.g. `Spend` entries with category `food` will not match if budget field is specified as `<cat> FOOD`).

There are 3 ways to specify the duration (start, end) of a budget:

1. <start>START_DATE <end>END_DATE
2. <start>START_DATE <dur>DURATION_IN_DAYS
3. <month>MM-YYYY

Example Format 1: `*budget* <amt>AMOUNT <start>START_DATE <end>END_DATE [<met>TRANSACTION_METHOD]` +
Example Format 2: `*budget* <amt>AMOUNT <start>START_DATE <dur>DURATION_IN_DAYS [<cat>CATEGORY_NAME]` +
Example Format 3: `*budget* <amt>AMOUNT <month>MM-YYYY [<place>PLACE_OF_SPENDING]` +
e.g. `budget <amt> 300 <month>11-2019 <met>cash`
// end::finance2[]

==== List out all budgets: `listb`

List out all budgets which have been recorded down.

Format: `*listb*`

=== Saving the data

_Modulo_ data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous _Modulo_ folder.
