    "description": "This course offers a first introduction to the history of sexuality in modern Europe and its empires from the Enlightenment to the early 21st century. It will explore human sexuality not as a universal constant, but as a socio-discursive construction, moulded and remoulded by historical change. After engaging with some of the critical debates about sexuality's history that have shaped the field, the course will move on to explore a range of important themes that trace the trajectory through which sexuality has helped to model the contours, identities and fears of modern Europe and its imagined Others.",
