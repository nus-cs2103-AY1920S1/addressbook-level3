    "description": "The histories of Singapore and the Japanese Empire collided in 1942, when a Japanese army captured the city and renamed it Syonan, the 'Light of the South.' For three-and-a-half years, Syonan served as the 'nerve centre' of Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia, and the occupation experience transformed the lives of local residents. The historical record of the occupation is incomplete, however, and to understand it historians must use all the methodological tools at their disposal. This course provides an in-depth study of war and occupation in Singapore, as well as an introduction to the complex task of understanding the recent past.",
