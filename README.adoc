* _Modulo_ Modulo is an all-in-one student life application which is mainly targeted to NUS students. The app features four different functions which consists of weekly organizer, financial record system, quiz revision, and grades tracker.
* With _Modulo_, you no longer need to use multiple different applications to organise your student life.
Things like scheduling your timetable, recording down the tasks and events you need to do and attend, reviewing your academic progress,
creating your own question bank and keeping track of your expenses; _Modulo_ will handle it all.
* The application has a modern and streamlined GUI (Graphical User Interface) and most user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
