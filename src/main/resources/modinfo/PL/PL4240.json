    "description": "This course will examine the history and current status of research on emotion especially in relation to psychopathology. The background philosophy and two different traditions stemming from Plato and Aristotle will be summarised. Modern day approaches will be considered, and dimensional versus categorical approaches will be reviewed with their implications for clinical practice. Approaches to normal versus abnormal emotions will be considered, with analysis of how the five basic emotions of anxiety, anger, disgust, sadness, and happiness provide a framework for understanding emotional disorders. Therapy that focuses on emotion experience, expression, and regulation will be reviewed.",
