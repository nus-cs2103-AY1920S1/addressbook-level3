    "description": "What is a science fiction (SF) movie? How did SF movies and developments in science and technology influence each other during the twentieth century?\nWhat is the use of SF movies for societies? And why are SF movies much more popular in some countries than in others? By watching and analysing classic and contemporary SF movies from the US, the Soviet Union, Japan, China, and other countries, we will search for answers to these questions. Special emphasis will be given to analysing how historical, political, and cultural environments in different countries have influenced the production and acceptance of SF movies.",
