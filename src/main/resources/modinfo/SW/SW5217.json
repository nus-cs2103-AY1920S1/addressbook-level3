    "description": "The module provides advanced knowledge and skills of gerontological social work in institutionalized and community\u2010 based health care. It further encourages students to develop preventive strategies to promote healthy ageing through their meticulous evaluation of specialized ageing programs and services which have been implemented. Students work on the applied learning project that is an integral part of this course. Supervised projects would be complementary for the student\u2019s practical learning process. In light of multidisciplinary team approach and synthesized theorybased applications, this module intensively increases students\u2019 practical capacity through collaborations within and across multidisciplinary service networks for older adults.",
