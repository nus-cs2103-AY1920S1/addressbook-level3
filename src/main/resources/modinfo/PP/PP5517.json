    "description": "This module covers policy issues related to gender inequality in contemporary, developed societies in Asia. To understand the complex dynamics of gender inequality in the Asian region, we take the life course approach, compare developed Asian countries with their Western counterparts, and discuss both relevant theories and empirical evidence from various disciplines.The first half investigates causes of the inequality over the life course, and describes policy options to reduce the inequality at various life stages. The second half focuses on evaluating options and making policy recommendations, and examining additional topics to prepare governments for gender-sensitive policy design and implementation.",
