    "description": "Although the term 'Silk Road' was only coined in the late nineteenth century, the many land and maritime trade routes linking different parts of Asia have facilitated the movement of people, as well as the spread of ideas, commodities, and everyday practice from pre\u2010modern times to the present. Treating the silk routes as networks of exchange as well as sites of interactions where local dynamics meet global processes, this module not only canvasses the intellectual, social, artistic, and cultural histories of Asia, but also examines the theories and methodologies of writing connected and/or comparative Asian histories.",
