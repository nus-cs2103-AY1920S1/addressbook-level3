This module will investigate the above questions\nby exploring the different paradigms of sustainable development and urbanism. This\nmodule will understand how different actors and organisations \u2013 from state agencies to\ncorporations, from non-governmental organisations to community organisations \u2013 construct and practice sustainable urbanism through first-hand experience from site visits and field investigations.\n\nThis module offers a situated interdisciplinary understanding of the complexity of sustainable urbanism in Asia. It is designed for students who are interested in both Asia and environmentalism.",
