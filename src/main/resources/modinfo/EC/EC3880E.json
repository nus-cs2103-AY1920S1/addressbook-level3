    "description": "Society has oriented itself within cities for more than 10 millennia. Cities enable trade, self\u2010protection and social expression. They also create the need for politics, law and administration. This module investigates the phenomenon of cities. We discuss reasons why cities form, drawing on the example of both ancient and modern cities. Then, we discuss the success and failures of cities at fulfilling the purposes of their formation, and explore the reasons for the success of some cities and the failure of others. What makes a city great? Why do cities fall? How should cities be managed to achieve 'greatness'?",
