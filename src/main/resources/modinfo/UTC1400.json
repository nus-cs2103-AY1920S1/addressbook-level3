The timespan covers Singapore\u2019s founding as a colonial economic \u201cplace\u201d in 1819, the events leading to postcolonial independence in 1959\u20131965, and the formation of communities into a \u201cnation\u201d. We will focus on the interplay of global economic factors with internal social factors, and challenge students to ask how the engagement of communities and community leaders impacts economic development.",
