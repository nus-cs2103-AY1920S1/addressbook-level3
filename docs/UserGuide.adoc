== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event.
Hackathons are difficult to manage manually as they involve different groups of individuals, each
of whom have a different role to play and agenda to fulfill in the Hackathon. Alfred helps streamline
this organisation and management process, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with the logistics
and administrative details of the Hackathon you are organising.

Furthermore, Alfred is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while
maintaining the benefits of having visual responses in a Graphical User Interface. This means that users mainly
interact with Alfred by typing on the keyboard, instead of using the mouse to point and click. Point-and-click
functionality is supported, but is not the main focus of the application.

Interested? Well, head to <<Quick Start>> to get started. We hope Alfred serves you well!

== About

This User Guide introduces you to Alfred's features and how you can use them to enhance your productivity
when organising a Hackathon. You can use Alfred to add and track participants in your Hackathon, assign mentors
to participants, keep track of the scores of each team in a leaderboard, undo and redo changes you make, and a
whole lot more. Note that Alfred was built for you to focus on and organise a single Hackathon event.

Alfred was designed to be as easy to use as possible, and the only assumption we made is that users are
comfortable typing into a keyboard to interact with Alfred. No other technical knowledge is needed! It's that simple.

Alfred is designed to be cross-platform and is available for the Linux, Windows and Mac OS operating systems.

Some simple conventions are used for this User Guide:

. Commands - You will typically interact with Alfred through what we call "commands". Each command is simply some
text that you enter into Alfred. The command text that you should enter at the command line is formatted as `user input`


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `alfred.jar` link:{releaseURL}[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Alfred.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. Alternatively, if you use a Mac, type the command `java -jar alfred.jar` or replace `alfred.jar` with the name of the jar file downloaded.
on terminal in the jar file's directory to open and start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.Layout of the application

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some sample commands you can experiment with:

* *`list teams`* : lists teams in the hackathon
* *`add participant n/Bartholomew Lim p/+6597654321 e/barrytheflash@superheros.com`* : adds a new participant named `Bartholomew Lim` to the Hackathon.
* *`delete participant P-1`* : removes the participant with ID P-1 from the hackathon.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Parameter Constraints and Additional Information

****

**`Entity Type`**

* **Mentor**

** A mentor has a name, phone number, email address, an organization, and a specialty (i.e. subject name) which must take on values mentioned below under "Parameters."
** Two mentors are considered as the same mentor if and only if they have the same names along with one of their phone numbers or emails.

* **Participant**

** A participant has a name, phone number, and an email address.
** Two participants are considered as the same participant if and only if they have the same names along with one of their phone numbers or emails.

* **Team**

** A team has a team name, a subject to focus on, score, its project name, and its location (table number).
** A team may also contain one mentor and an arbitrary number of participants (setting of restrictions coming in v2.0).
** Two teams are considered as the same team if and only if they have the same team names or project names.

All entities will also receive a unique ID, which means no two entity will share the same ID. That is, entities with same ID will also be considered as a same entity. This is to be considered for specific commands such as the <<CSV File Formatting>> under the <<Bulk Registration: `import fp/PATH_TO_CSV_FILE [fp/PATH_TO_ERROR_FILE]`, Bulk Registration>> command.

**`Parameters`**

`Name`, `Organization`, `ProjectName` - can be any combination of spaces, letters, and these special characters (,.-')

`Phone` - can be any combination of numbers (at least three digits), space, hyphens (-), and periods (.) with or without a country code. Country code of Singapore (`+65`) will be automatically included if it is not added.

`Email` - must include an address and an email domain. It can include special characters (-,.), excluding bracket.

`SubjectName` - the subject a mentor or team will be focusing on in the Hackathon +
Must be one of the values below:

* Environmental
* Social
* Health
* Education
* Entertainment
* Social

`Score` - must be an integer ranging from 0 to 100.

`Location` - must be an integer ranging from 1 to 1000, indicating a table number. Only one team is allowed per table

[[Features]]
== Features

====

*Prelude - Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which you need to supply. For example, in `add mentor n/NAME`,
`NAME` is a parameter which you need to specify as the mentor's name (i.e. `add mentor n/John Doe`).
* You can input the parameters in any order. For instance, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you may input `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` and Alfred will still consider it as an acceptable command.
* Words in {curly braces} indicate values for the command that you need to select and provide.
** For example in the case of `add {mentor/participant/list}`, you can choose to type `add mentor`, `add participant` or `add team`
* Words in [brackets] indicate values that are optional for the command.
** For example, in the case of `export [CSV_FILE_PATH]`, you can choose to leave out the file path.
* Whenever you need to specify an ID, the ID will be prefixed with an alphabet indicating the type of the Entity (e.g. M for Mentors, P for Participants, T for Teams).
* Type your commands in the textbox displayed on the Alfred UI. After you are done typing the command, press kbd:[Enter] on your keyboard to execute the command.

Also, please refer to <<Parameter Constraints and Additional Information>> for more information on the different restrictions for each parameter.

====

=== Saving the data:

Data in Alfred is saved to the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need for you to save the data manually.

Should any tampering of the data in storage result in an invalid state for the data, the data will be re-initialised and the old data will be lost.
Hence, please avoid directly altering the storage files as any minor errors could result in permanent
loss of critical information.

=== Viewing help : `help`

If at anytime you don't understand how to do a certain thing on Alfred, use this command to display a
help page in a separate pop-up window.

****
* Should you require further information, the pop-up window also includes links to further references and documentation.
****

Format: `help`

=== Adding an Entity: `add {participant/mentor/team}`

Use this command to add a new entity for Alfred to keep track of. +

****
* Creates an Entity as specified by you. Each Entity object will have a unique ID automatically assigned to it.
* As of version 1.1, you must provide all the fields. There are no optional fields.
* Note that the Specialisation and Subject fields can only take on the values specified in `SubjectName` in <<Parameter Constraints and Additional Information>>:
****

==== Adding a Participant: `add participant PARAMETERS`

Use this command to add a new Participant to Alfred to keep track of for your hackathon.

****
* Participants have the fields "Name", "Phone number" and "Email address" which you must provide.
****

Format: `add participant n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS`

Examples:

* `add participant n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`

* `add participant n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com p/1234567`

==== Adding a Mentor: `add mentor PARAMETERS`
Use this command to add a new Mentor to Alfred to keep track of for your Hackathon.

****
* Mentors have the fields "Name", "Phone number" and "Email address."
* Mentors also have a field called "Organization", which refers to the organization for which they work.
* Mentors also have a field called "Specialisation", which refers to the field of work they specialise in. The Specialisation can only take on the values specified in `SubjectName` in <<Parameter Constraints and Additional Information>>.
* All of these fields must be specified in order to successfully add a mentor.
****

Format: `add mentor  n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS o/ORGANIZATION s/SPECIALISATION`

Examples:

* `add mentor n/Professor Superman p/91236549 e/clarkkent@gmail.com o/Daily Planet s/Social`

* `add mentor n/Doctor Batman p/91236549 e/bruce@gmail.com o/Google s/Environmental`

==== Adding a Team: `add team PARAMETERS`

Use this command to add a new Team to Alfred to keep track of for your Hackathon.
****
* Teams have the fields "Name", "Project name" and "Table Number" which you must provide.
* Teams also have a field called "Subject", which refers the area the team's project focuses on, and must be chosen from the predetermined list of subjects described in `SubjectName` in <<Parameter Constraints and Additional Information>>.
****

Format: `add team n/NAME s/SUBJECT pn/PROJECT_NAME l/TABLE_NUMBER`

Examples:

* `add team n/Team01 s/Social pn/EmotionTrain l/12`

* `add team n/HackathonWinners4Sure s/Environmental pn/Path-ify l/3`

=== Updating an Entity: `edit {mentor/participant/team} ENTITY_ID [PARAMETERS]`

Edits an entity based on the parameter values you supply. Use this command in case you want to make changes to an entity you have already created within Alfred.

****
* Updates the fields of the Entity with the `ENTITY_ID` you specified to the new fields you type in as the parameter. The ID is the unique identifier for the particular Entity you wish to edit.
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* The fields you provide must pertain to the specified entity in order for the edit to be successful. For instance, you cannot add a field "pn/NewProjectName" for a participant as a participant doesn't have a project name.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values you provide.
****

Examples:

* `edit mentor M-1 n/NewMentorName`

* `edit team T-1 n/NewTeamName pn/New Project Name`

* `edit participant P-1 n/NewParticipantNAme`

=== Listing all Entities : `list {mentors/participants/teams}`

Shows a list of all the entities corresponding to the entity you specified that Alfred keeps track of.

****
* The fields of the Entity will be displayed on Alfred's Graphical User Interface.
****

Examples:

* `list mentors` will list all mentors stored within Alfred.

* `list participants` will list all hackathon participants stored within Alfred.

* `list teams` will list all hackathon teams stored within Alfred.

=== Deleting an Entity: `delete {mentor/participant/team} ID`
Deletes an Entity, so that Alfred will no longer keep track of that Entity.

****
* Deletes the Entity with the ID that you specify.
* Note that when you delete a Team, all the participants that are part of that team will also be deleted as well.
****

Examples:

* `delete mentor M-1` will delete the mentor with ID M-1 from Alfred.

* `delete participant P-1` will delete the participant with ID P-1 from Alfred.

* `delete team T-1` will delete the team with ID T-1 from Alfred.

=== Finding a Specific Entity: `find {mentor/team/participant} n/NAME ...`

Searches for Entities by selected fields, instead of their ID, in case you find that the ID is difficult to keep track of. +

****
* Take note that the `find` command only searches
and matches the fields whose strings are a substring of the given value. It also does an intersection
search in the event where one or more fields are provided, that is, the entities found would have the selected values
for each of the fields you key in
****

Examples:

* `find mentor n/Joshua Wong` will display a list of all mentors in the Hackathon who are named "Joshua Wong", or have "Joshua Wong" in their name.

* `find participant n/John Doe` will display a list of all participants in the Hackathon who are named "John Doe", or have "John Doe" in their name.

* `find team n/FutureHackathonWinner` will display a list of all teams in the Hackathon that are named "FutureHackathonWinner", or have "FutureHackathonWinner" in their name.

Each entity will have different fields available to find.

For participant, `n/NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE` are all options to search for.

For team, `n/TEAMNAME pn/PROJECTNAME` are also all options to search for.

For mentor, `n/NAME, e/EMAIL, p/PHONE o/ORGANIZATION` are all available

Example for multiple fields:

* `find participant n/Damith e/damith.com` finds all participants whose name contains the string "Damith" (this is case
sensitive) and whose emails contain "damith.com"

//tag::assign[]
=== Assigning a Entity to a Team: `assign {mentor/participant} ID TEAM_ID ...`

Assigns Mentor or Participant Entity by their ID to a team identified by TEAM_ID. +

****
* Take note that the `assign` command can only be used to assign Participants and Mentors to a Team.
* An error will be shown is the Team already has a Mentor.
* An error will be shown if the Team already has said Participant.
****

Examples:

* `assign mentor M-18 T-2` will assign Mentor with ID M-18 to Team with ID T-2. Running the command will show you the following output in the 'Team' section of the GUI:

image::AssignCommandExample1.png[width="790"]

* `assign participant P-100 T-2` will assign Participant with ID P-100 to Team with ID T-2. Running the command will show you the following output in the 'Team' section of the GUI:

image::AssignCommandExample2.png[width="790"]
//end::assign[]

//tag::remove[]
=== Removing an Entity from a Team: `remove {mentor/participant} ID TEAM_ID ...`

Removes Mentor or Participant Entity by their ID from a team identified by TEAM_ID. +

****
* Take note that the `remove` command can only be used to remove Participant or Mentor from a Team.
* An error will be shown if the Participant or Mentor is not in the specific Team.
* Deleting a Participant or Mentor will also delete all their connections with a team or teams.
****

Examples:

* `remove mentor M-18 T-8` will remove Mentor with ID M-18 to Team with ID T-8. Running the command will show you the text 'Mentor not assigned' in the respective team. The following will be shown in the 'Team' section of the GUI:

image::RemoveCommandExample1.png[width="790"]

* `remove participant P-100 T-2` will remove Participant with ID P-100 from Team with ID T-2.Running the command will show you the following output in the 'Team' section of the GUI

image::RemoveCommandExample2.png[width="790"]
//end::remove[]

=== Show Command History: `history`
Shows you up to the last 50 commands that you executed.

****
* This command is to facilitate the undo/redo commands, as it becomes easier for you to track what changes were made before.
* The "History" section of Alfred displays all the previously-executed commands as panels. There are 3 main delimiters.
* You cannot redo any command beyond the "redo" delimiter.
* You cannot undo any command beyond the "undo" delimiter.
* The "current" delimiter tells you where you are at relative to the rest of the commands you have executed.
* Note that only commands that change the state of the data in Alfred will be displayed in the "History" section and are undo/redo-able.
For instance, `list participants` will not be undo/redo-able, as it simply shows you the participants in Alfred and does not change any information in Alfred.
On the other hand, invoking `add participant` with the suitable parameters will be undo/redo-able and will be shown in the "History" section by the `history` command.
****

Example:

After running the following commands:

1. `list participants`
2. `add participant n/Bartholomew Lim p/+6593121212 e/barrytheflash@gmail.com`
3. `add participant n/Diana Prince p/+6593111111 e/singaporewonderwoman@hotmail.com`

Running `history` will show you the following output in the "History" section of the Graphical User Interface:

image::HistoryCommandExampleOutput.png[width="790"]

//Add annotations to image when the UI is finalised.
The topmost panel is the "redo" delimiter. +
The second panel from the top is the "current" delimiter. +
The bottommost panel shows you the "undo" delimiter. +
This means that you can invoke the `undo` command twice, as both AddParticipantCommands can be undone.
Notice that the `list participants` command is not shown in the "History" section as it does not change data.

=== Undo Previous Commands: `undo`
Undoes the previous command you executed.

****
* Undoes the effects of the previous command you executed, and will return Alfred to the previous state (as though you never executed the previous command).
* All commands that can be undone can be found in the output of the `history` command.
* To be certain which command you are actually undo-ing, first run the `history` command and examine the output.
* Only the commands that actually change the data in Alfred will be undo-able. Commands that perform read operations (such as `find` and `list`) will not be found in the output of the `history` command.
****

Format: `undo`

=== Redo Previous Commands: `redo`
Redoes the previous command you executed.

****
* Redoes the effects of the previous command you executed, and will return Alfred to the previous state (as though you re-executed the previous command).
* All commands that can be redone can be found in the output of the `history` command.
* To be certain which command you are actually redo-ing, first run the `history` command and examine the output.
* Only the commands that actually change the data in Alfred will be redo-able. Commands that perform read operations (such as `find` and `list`) will not be found in the output of the `history` command.
****

Format: `redo`

==== List Team Ranking: `leaderboard`
Use this command to display the ranking of the teams in the hackathon in descending order of their points.

****
* Once you run this command, Alfred's UI will display a list of all the teams stored within Alfred sorted in descending order of their points.
* By default Alfred sorts teams with equal points in the order they were added into Alfred, based on their ID.
****

Format: `leaderboard`

==== Get the top k teams: `getTop NUMBER`
Use this command to list the top k teams in the leaderboard, where k is a number (NUMBER) which you specify.

****
* This command will show you a cropped version of the leaderboard.
* Alfred's UI will display a list of top "k" teams based on their current score.
* Do note that this command does not discriminate between teams of the same score - Teams with equal scores will be
counted as one. Due to this, the command "getTop 1" (for example) may show more than 1 team if there are more than 1 teams with the
same high score.
* If you input `NUMBER` as a number more than the number of teams in the hackathon, Alfred will simply display all the teams in the Hackathon, in desceding order of their points.
****

Format: `getTop NUMBER`

Example:

* `getTop 5` will display the top 5 teams with the highest points in the hackathon.

* `getTop 20` will display the top 20 teams with the highest points in the hackathon.

==== Tie-Break

By default Alfred sorts the Leaderboard by order of descending scores and by order they were added into Alfred in case tied up scores. However, Alfred also provides greater flexibility in choosing how you want to break the tie between the teams when calling the `leaderboard` or `getTop` commands. To break a tie, follow the following format:

* `leaderboard tb/METHOD_1 METHOD_2 METHOD_3` in the case of a `leaderboard` command
* `getTop NUMBER tb/METHOD_1 METHOD_2 METHOD_3` in the case of a `getTop NUMBER` command

where `METHOD_N` is one of the following currently available tie-break methods:

* `moreParticipants`: teams with more participants are win the tie.
* `lessParticipants`: teams with lesser participants are win the tie.
* `higherId`: teams registered more recently (hence the highest ID) win the tie.
* `lowerId`: teams registered earlier (hence the lowest ID) win the tie.
* `random`: in case all methods used yield no distinct winner, `random` can be used as a method of last resort to break a tie in favour of a randomly chosen team.

****
* You may choose one or more methods from the above list to break the tie. You need to precede the tie-break methods with the prefix `tb/` and separate each method with a single space for Alfred to properly understand them.
* Use the prefix "tb/" with discretion as Alfred will only select tiebreak methods followed by ZZthe last "tb/" prefix if more than one such prefix is specfied in the command.
* Do note that the tie-break methods will be applied in the order in which you state them. That is, first METHOD_1 will be applied to break the ties, and only then will METHOD_2 be applied to break any remaining ties, if the command `leaderboard tb/METHOD_1 METHOD_2` is called.
* The `getTop NUMBER` command may still display teams more than the value of `NUMBER` if Alfred was still unsuccessful in breaking certain ties despite applying the tie-break methods you stated.
* When using the `random` method, it must be the last stated tie-break method if it is being used alongside other tie-break methods.
****

Example:

* `leaderboard tb/moreParticipants lowerId` will display the leaderboard on the UI with Alfred breaking the tie between teams with equals scores based on which team has more participants, and if the number of participants is equal then by which team has the lower ID.
* `getTop 3 tb/lessParticipants random` will display the top 3 teams on the UI with Alfred breaking the tie between teams with equals scores based on which team has fewer participants, and if the number of participants is equal then Alfred will randomly pick the winners for the tie.

==== Add points: `score add TEAM_ID POINTS`

Adds the value of POINTS to the current score of the team with ID TEAM_ID.

****
* Use this command when you want to award a particular team a certain amount of points.
* If you try to award more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 points as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message.
* If the addition of points makes the team's total exceed the maximum, the score will simply be set to the maximum score.
****

Example:

* `score add T-1 20` will add 20 points to the score of the team with ID T-1.

* `score add T-5 60` will add 60 points to the score of the team with ID T-5.

==== Subtract points: `score sub TEAM_ID NEW_POINTS`

Deducts the value of POINTS from the current score of the team with ID TEAM_ID.

****
* Use this command when you want to take away a certain amount of points from a particular team.
* If you try to subtract more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message. If the subtraction of points makes the team's total go below the minimum (which is set to 0 points), the score will simply be set to 0.
****

Example:

* `score sub T-1 15` will subtract 20 points from the score of the team with ID T-1.

* `score sub T-5 10` will subtract 10 points from the score of the team with ID T-5.

==== Set points: `score set TEAM_ID NEW_POINTS`
Sets the score of the team with ID TEAM_ID to a new score NEW_POINTS, regardless of the team's current score.

****
* Use this command when you want to set a team's score to an exact score, rather than adding or subtracting points from their current score.
* If you try to set more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message.
****

Example:

* `score set T-1 15` will set the score of the team with ID T-1 as 15.

* `score set T-5 10` will set the score of the team with ID T-5 as 10.

Do note that if you try to subtract more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message. If the subtraction of points makes the team's total go below the minimum (which is set to 0 points), the score will simply be set to 0.

=== Bulk Registration: `import fp/PATH_TO_CSV_FILE [fp/PATH_TO_ERROR_FILE]`
You may import multiple entities at once into Alfred through the specification of a CSV file. +
If the PATH_TO_ERROR_FILE is specified, Alfred will create a new CSV file with all of the lines that were not able to be loaded.

Example:

* `import fp/C:/User/Hackathon2019/participant.csv` will import data from the participant.csv file into Alfred.
* `import fp/Hackathon2019/participant.csv` will look for the CSV file in your current directory (or the folder where alfred.jar is downloaded).

Example usage of error file is shown at the end of <<CSV File Formatting>>.

==== CSV File Formatting
In order for the contents of the CSV file to be correctly loaded into Alfred, the file has to be in the correct format.

****
`EntityType` - single capital letter representing the entity type

* **Mentor:** M
* **Participant:** P
* **Team:** T

`[ID]` - the ID of the entity (optional)

* **Mentor:** M-d, where d can be any positive integer
* **Participant:** P-d, where d can be any positive integer
* **Team:** T-d, where d can be any positive integer
** You can also express `ID` as only a positive integer.

For the rest of the parameters, please refer to <<Parameter Constraints and Additional Information>>.

Example:

* P,P-1,Bruce Wayne,23456789,wbruce@wayne.ent
* P,1,Bruce Wayne,+6523456789,wbruce@wayne.ent
* P,,Bruce Wayne,+65 23456789,wbruce@wayne.ent

===== Team Data
Header: `EntityType,ID,Name,Participants,Mentor,SubjectName,Score,ProjectName,Location`

****
`[Participants]` - A list of participant IDs in the team. +
This field is optional, but if it is included, participants with given ID must exist in Alfred.

`[Mentor]` - An ID of the mentor associated with the team. +
This field is also optional, but if it is included, mentor with given ID must exist in Alfred.

If you are importing multiple entity data at once, don't worry! Alfred will make sure Participant and Mentor data are loaded before Team data to ensure that all of them are present in Alfred before checking whether they exist or not.

See example usage down below.
****

Example:

* T,T-1,Justice League,,,Social,100,Save the Earth,1
* T,1,Justice League,[P-1|P-2|P-3],M-1,Social,100,Save the Earth,1
* T,,Justice League,[P-1|P-2|P-3],1,Social,100,Save the Earth,1

***

Alfred will recognize each of the entity headers and will not count it as an error. Example CSV file may look like this:

****

Alfred.csv

EntityType,ID,Name,Participants,Mentor,SubjectName,Score,ProjectName,Location +
T,,Justice League,[P-1|P-2],M-1,Social,100,Save the Earth,1 +
T,,Amazon Warriors,[P-3|P-4],,Environmental,100,Save the Amazon,2 +
EntityType,ID,Name,Phone,Email,Organization,SubjectName +

P,3,Diana,+6547234328,diana@amazon.com +
P,3,Lois Lane,+6598765432,loislane@dailyplanet.org

****

Assuming Alfred has no data, we can see that lines 3, 6, and 11 will fail.

* Line 3: No participant with ID P-4 exist (Missing entity)
* Line 6: Phone number is missing and email is invalid (Invalid format)
* Line 11: Another participant with ID P-3 exists (Duplicate entity)

If you give the following command to Alfred,

`import fp/Alfred.csv fp/Alfred_Errors.csv`

then the following CSV file will be created where Alfred.csv is located at.

****

=== Export Data: `export [{mentor/participant/team}] [fp/DESIRED_CSV_FILE_PATH]`
You may export Alfred data to an external CSV file. If the entity type is specified, Alfred will export all the data corresponding to that entity type only. If the desired CSV file path is left empty, Alfred will create a CSV file at the default location (`./AlfredData/Alfred_Data.csv`).

Example:

* `export` will export all entities' data in Alfred to the default file path: `/AlfredData/Alfred_Data.csv`.
* `export mentor fp/data/Alfred.csv` will export all mentor data in Alfred to `/data/Alfred.csv`. If the any folders do not happen to exist, Alfred will create them for you.

=== Help command

The help command will list all the commands you need to use this
application properly!

Simply run `help`.

//tag::home[]
=== Home command: `home`
This command allows you to navigate to the homepage where the system statistics are updated in real time. The homepage statistics are also available when you start-up the application.

Example:
Suppose you want to check the distribution of teams by subjects, in order to gauge the demand for mentors for each subject.

Instead of manually sieving through all the teams by the subject that their project is on, you can easily view the distribution of teams and mentors by subject via the home command.

To navigate to home:

1.	Type home into the command box, and press ```Enter``` to execute it.

2.	The result box will display the message “Showing homepage” in the result box. You can see the statistics and the ‘Home’ section of sidebar being highlighted.
    Below is the layout of  the homepage:

=== Command Suggestion Prompt
As you type, there will be a popup box predicting the type of commands you are going to type. You can navigate through these suggestions and choose the template that suits you.

Example:
Let us suppose that you want to type the command `add mentor` and you forgot the fields that are required in the command.

Instead of going through the user guide to look for the command, a popup box will appear as you type. The content in this box will change as you type, such that the commands suggested will start with the words or letters that you have already entered.

As you type:
1.	Type ‘add’ into the command box, and `add participant`, `add mentor` and `add team`  commands will be suggested to you. The grey text are meant as guides and blue text are meant as usage instructions . These text will not appear if you choose the command.
