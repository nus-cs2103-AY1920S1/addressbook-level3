    "description": "This module examines the meaning of the concept 'grand strategy,' and its relationship to statecraft. Attention is paid to the ways in which historical personalities thought about power and defined priorities, as well as the manner in which these actors developed, mobilized, and exploited an array of resources and measures to advance specific goals. Their successes and failures will be evaluated, and some principles about grand strategy will be drawn from the study of historical cases.",
