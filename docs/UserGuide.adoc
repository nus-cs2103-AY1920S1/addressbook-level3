== Introduction:

MyProject (MP) is for team leaders who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their projects.
MP is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
With MP it is a one-stop app to store and manage your projects and their relevant information,
this is especially useful if you are always managing multiple projects across different teams.
MP has unique functions such as sending emails to members within the app and financial tracking capabilities etc.
Currently our app is optimized  for students to use but we intend to expand further to working adults as well.

[NOTE]
This command is used to return to the project list page after checking out to a project.

==== Exiting the app: `exit`

Once you're done with using the app, you can use this command to close the app.

Format: `exit`

=== Adding Items

This section deals with adding information to the application.

==== Add a project: `addProject`

Adds a new project into your list of projects. +
Format: `addProject n/PROJECT_TITLE s/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`

Example:

* `addProject n/CS2103 project s/Software engineering project`

==== Add a person: `add`

Adds a person to your contacts.
When you add a person to your contacts, it will automatically change to displaying your list of contacts. +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`


=====  Add a member to your project

Adding a member can be done in 2 ways, you can either add a new person to your contacts and to your current project,
or you can simply add an existing person from your contacts to your current project.


====== 1. Add a new member: `addMember` [Checkout]

This command is similar to adding a person to your contacts shown previously, except that you have to be
checked out into a project. +
Format: `addMember n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/address] [t/tag]...`

[TIP]
Adding a member only requires his/her name!

However it will be good to add as much information as possible.

Example:

* `addMember n/John Doe a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

* `addMember n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com t/friend t/criminal`


====== 2. Add from your contacts: `addFromContacts` [Checkout]

This command helps to add a person you already saved in your contacts into your project, reducing the need
to type his information all over again. All you need to do is enter the index he is listed at. +
Format: `addFromContacts INDEX`


`INDEX` is the number which the person is listed at, and it should be a positive integer eg. 1, 2, 3, ....


Example:

* `addFromContacts 1`

==== Add a timetable: `addTimetable`

Need to keep track of your team members' schedule? Use this command to record down their timetable easily!

[TIP]

Example:

* `addTimetable 3 f//home/john/Desktop/aliceTimetable.txt` +
Add Alice's timetable to Alice, who has index 3 in the list of persons.

[NOTE]
File should be formatted as a newline separated list of time ranges, e.g: +
MONDAY 1000 MONDAY 1200 +
MONDAY 1400 MONDAY 1600 +
TUESDAY 1100 TUESDAY 1500

* `addTimetable 2 n/https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-1/share?CS2100=LAB:05,TUT:02,LEC:1&CS2101=&CS2103T=LEC:G13&CS2105=TUT:03,LEC:1&CS3241=TUT:05,LEC:1&CS3243=TUT:01,LEC:1&GEQ1000=TUT:D27` +
Add timetable to the person with index 2 on the list of persons, by retrieving timetable data from NUSMods.

Below is a step-by-step instruction to guide you through the process of adding a timetable to Alice, through the use of NUSMods:

* Step 1: Type `addTimetable`, followed by the index of the person you wish to add the timetable to, and the URL of the share link.

=== Sorting

The following section provides a set of commands which help with sorting the information inside the
application. MyProject makes it very easy and user-friendly by making all sort commands follow the same
format and index/order pairing as shown below!

****
All commands in this section follow this set of index/order pairing, where applicable:

. Alphabetical order
. Increasing order of time
. Whether tasks are done
. Whether tasks are done and then by increasing order of time
. Increasing price
****

[NOTE]
The default sorting order for the following lists is by increasing order of time(index 2). Whenever MyProject
is closed, the ordering will return to the default order.

==== Sort tasks: `sortTask` [Checkout]

This command sorts the tasks in the task list of the current working project. +
Format: `sortTask INDEX`

`INDEX` refers to the index of the list provided in the highlighted section above which corresponds to the type of sorting you wish to apply.
For example, index 1 corresponds to sorting by alphabetical order. For the case of sorting tasks, only numbers between 1 and 4 are applicable.

Example:

Let's say you have added many different tasks with different deadlines and progresses into MyProject. +

The default sorting order that MyProject offers is by increasing order of time(index 2). However you wish to group those tasks that are done in one group and those not done in another group and
then further sort each group by increasing order of time(index 4) to track the progress of your tasks. +

Simply type in the command `sortTask 4` and all the tasks in the list will immediately be sorted accordingly. +

In addition, whenever you add a new task(Section 3.2.4) or edit the details of an existing task(Section 3.3.2), MyProject will automatically insert
the newly added or edited task into the correct position based on this new sorting order so you don't have to continuously type this command whenever
you wish to add or edit tasks! +

Here is a step by step process on how to do this.

. Firstly, since this command is labeled with [Checkout] at the start, ensure that you `checkout` to a project first.
Notice how the tasks in the task list are currently at the default sorting order which is by increasing order of time.
image:sortTask1.png[]

. Next, enter the command `sortTask 4` into the command line and press enter. You can choose any index from 1-4 depending
on which type of sorting order you wish to sort by based on the specifications provided in the highlighted section above.
image:sortTask2.png[]

. The following success message will be displayed if the input was entered correctly. Check that the type of sorting
displayed in the success message is the one you actually wanted. +
The tasks in the task list will then be immediately sorted accordingly as shown in the white box.
image:sortTask3.png[]

. Now let's say the deadline for task 2(Do UG) is pushed forward by a week and you've just completed it. Type in the command
`editTask 2 d/ c/04/12/2019 0000`(check out section 3.3.2 for more details on the editTask command) into the command line and press enter. +
The task will be edited accordingly and immediately be sorted into the correct position as shown below.
image:sortTask4.png[]


==== Sort spending: `sortSpending` [Checkout]

Sorts the spending in the budget list of the current working project based on given specification. The implementation is
slightly different from sortTask. MyProject will not show you the list of spending immediately after entering
the command `sortSpending`. Enter the command `listBudget` to view the newly sorted list of spending. +
Format: `sortSpending INDEX`

`INDEX` refers to which type of sorting you want to do. In this case, only integers 1, 2 and 5 are applicable.(Refer to the highlighted section above)

Example:

* `sortSpending 5` (Sorts the spending by increasing prices)

==== Sort meeting: `sortMeeting` [Checkout]
Sorts the meetings in the meeting list of the current working project based on given specification. The implementation is
exactly the same as sortTask. Refer to the sortTask section for a more detailed explanation. +
Format: `sortMeeting INDEX`

`INDEX` refers to which type of sorting you want to do. In this case, only integers 1 and 2 are applicable.(Refer to the highlighted section above)

Example:

* `sortMeeting 1` (Sorts the meetings by alphabetical order)
