== Introduction
This portfolio provides an overview of the CS2103/T Revision Tool and highlights my contribution in the project including a brief description of the key features that I implemented.

=== The Team
Our team of 5 consists of 2 Year 4 Engineering Science students, a Year 4 Industrial & Systems Engineering student, a Year
3 Communications and New Media student and myself, a Year 2 Computer Science / Business student.

=== About the Project

This 7-week project was started as part of NUS' Software Engineering (CS2103/T) module. The team was required to
to either morph or enhance an existing application (link:{ab3Url}/[Address Book - Level 3]). Our team decided to morph the project
into the CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT) a desktop quiz application which allows users to create customised question banks
and attempt the quizzes in an interactive manner. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

As the Team Lead of the project, my role was to ensure that the team met the milestones and to coordinate the integration
of the entire application. Furthermore, I developed the main driver for the Quiz Mode in the application which was the backbone
of many of the other features.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the main driver for the quiz*

** *What it does*: After entering quiz mode, the driver parses user input, determines whether the answer is correct and displays the next question. At the end of each level and the entire quiz, the user is shown his/her score and given the choice to continue (i.e. proceed to the next level or restart) or exit the quiz.
** *Justification*: This essential feature is the core of the application and allows other features to be built upon it. Furthermore, it significantly improves the product as it adds the element of interaction to the application.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement required the deep understanding of the entire project structure as it can be considered the nervous system that connects the application from UI to Storage. Other functionality such as answering MCQs, True & False or Short-Answer Questions (SAQ) were built upon this feature. This feature was also tested using automated GUI tests.
** Credits: Code for the GUI display was adapted from Address Book – Level 3 and the structure for GUI tests was adapted from Address Book - Level 4.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Created the Normal and Arcade mode for the quiz. In Arcade Mode, each level has increasing difficulty and a shorter time limit, whenever a user gets a question wrong, the quiz ends and the user has to restart.
** Created the abstract `Answerable` Class for subclasses such as `MCQ`, `TrueFalse` and `SAQ` classes to be built upon using the factory design pattern.
** Added an interactive progress bar for each level in the quiz.
** Implemented the adaptable UI for each type of question’s answers (i.e. allowing the GUI to change from displaying 4 panels for MCQs to 2 panels for True & False questions).

* *Code contributed*: You can view the code I contributed to this project link:{contributedCodeUrl}[here]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed release v1.4 on GitHub
*** Managed issues and resolved the main bulk of the post Mock PE issues.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Wrote additional GUI tests to increase coverage from 50% to 75% (PR link:{pullUrl}/158[#158], link:{pullUrl}/161[#161], link:{pullUrl}/163[#163])
*** Updated the GUI colour scheme and added aesthetic artifacts such as level label (PR link:{pullUrl}/98[#98], link:{pullUrl}/148[#148])
*** Created skeleton class for `AnswerableBuilder` using Java Generics and builder design pattern so that my teammates will be able to build upon it easily (PR link:{pullUrl}/148[#148], link:{pullUrl}/149[#149])

** Documentation:
*** Created skeleton sequence and activity diagrams for the team to reuse so that the DG can have a more congruent look.
*** Added all the use cases for the project.

** Community:
*** Reviewed this link:{mainPullUrl}/14[PR].
*** Helped a fellow student in this link:{issuesUrl}/60[forum post].

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Starting the quiz: `start`.

User can start by choosing the mode of the quiz. (normal / arcade / custom). See <<Quiz Mode>> for in-quiz commands.

Format: `start mode/MODE`

[TIP]
To start all questions in the question bank, use command +
start mode/normal

Examples:

* `start mode/normal`
* `start mode/custom cat/uml /diff/1 timer/20`

=== Adding a question: `add`

Adds a question to the question bank

Format: `add type/TYPE q/QUESTION cat/CATEGORY diff/DIFFICULTY y/CORRECT_ANSWER x/WRONG_ANSWER... `

****
[%hardbreaks]
The following are the valid answer formats for each question type:
*MCQ*: 1 Correct answer and 3 Wrong answers.
*True & False*: 1 Correct answer (i.e. True / False) wrong answers omitted.
*SAQ*: Multiple correct answers, no wrong answers.
****

Examples:

* `add type/mcq q/According to the textbook, which kind of project is more difficult? cat/Week 2 diff/1
x/Greenfield x/Brownfield y/None of the others x/Padifield`
* `add type/tf q/OODMs are Class Diagrams cat/uml diff/2 y/true`
* `add type/saq q/What does UML stands for? cat/cs2103 diff/1 y/unified modeling language`

=== Editing a question : `edit`

Edits an existing question in the question bank.

Format: `edit INDEX [q/QUESTION] [cat/CATEGORY] [diff/DIFFICULTY] [x/WRONG_ANSWER]... [y/CORRECT_ANSWER]...`

****
* Edits the question at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed question list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing category and/or difficulty, the existing category and/or difficulty of the question will be removed
i.e adding of category and/or difficulty is not cumulative.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 q/According the the textbook, is greenfield or brownfield tougher?` +
Edits the the first question to "According the the textbook, is greenfield or brownfield tougher?"

== Quiz Mode

=== Normal Mode
Levels are separated by difficulty. At the end of each level, user has the choice to move on to the next level or exit the quiz.
The user is given 30 seconds to answer each question.

image::normal-mode.png[]

=== Arcade Mode
Levels are separated by difficulty. If the user enters a wrong answer before finishing the quiz. The quiz will end and display the results.
The user is given 30 seconds to answer each question in level 1. Subsequent level timers are 5 seconds faster than the previous level with
level 3 giving the user 20 seconds to answer each question.

image::arcade-mode.png[]

=== Custom Mode
`Category`, `Difficulty` and `Timer` (must be above 1 second) can be customised by the user. Levels are also sorted according to
difficulty.

=== Answering Questions
|======
|MCQ |TrueFalse |SAQ
|Answers can only be A, B, C, or D (Case insensitive) |Answers can only be True (T) / False (F) (Case insensitive)|Answers are open ended. Revision tool uses NLP to parse answers and determine whether they are correct.
|======

=== The `Answerable` Class

.Class Diagram of the Answerable Class
image::AnswerableClassDiagram.png[]

The main class that the Revision Tool operates on is the `Answerable` class.

Each `Answerable` class must have 1 `Question`, 1 `Difficulty` and can have any amount of categories associated with it.
The amount of answers that an `Answerable` can have depends on its type.

There are 3 subclasses of the `Answerable` Class which are: `Mcq`, `TrueFalse` and `Saq`. Each class defines it's
own rules on the validity of `Answer` s (highlighted in red in the class diagram) provided to it.

The following are the rules of validity for each subclass:

* Mcq: 4 answers in total. 1 correct answer, 3 wrong answers.
* TrueFalse: Either 'true' or 'false' as its answer.
* Saq: Any amount of answers.
[NOTE]
For all subclasses, there cannot be any duplicates of answers. For example, if an Mcq class has "option1" as one of its
wrong answers, it cannot have "option1" as its correct answer or another wrong answer.

=== Managing parsing in Configuration and Quiz Mode (Overview)
The Revision Tool uses two Parser interfaces (`Parser` and `QuizParser`) to parse different sets of commands (i.e. in Configuration Mode and in Quiz Mode).

.Class Diagram of ParserManager to display how parsers are created in both modes.
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[width=500]


As shown in the figure above, the `ParserManager` class is responsible for creating the respective parsers for Configuration and Quiz Mode.
This was designed while taking into consideration that the Quiz Mode Parsers (i.e. XYZParsers) will require
an extra `Answerable` argument on top of the user input String in order to carry out commands such as determining whether the user's input is the correct answer.
(E.g. to call methods such as Answerable#isCorrect(Answer))

As different commands are accepted in Configuration and Quiz Mode, the `ParserManager` class uses overloaded methods
(`parseCommand(String)` and `parseCommand(String, Answerable)` to determine the valid commands in each mode. If a Configuration Mode
command such as `add` were to be used in Quiz Mode, the ParserManager would deem the the command as invalid. +

With reference to Figure 6, The following are the parsers used in each mode:

* ABCParser (Configuration Mode):
** AddCommandParser
** DeleteCommandParser
** EditCommandParser
** FindCommandParser
** ListCommandParser
** StartCommandParser

* XYZParser (Quiz Mode):
** McqInputCommandParser
** TfInputCommandParser
** SaqInputCommandParser

A more detailed description of the implementation of parsing in Configuration and Quiz Mode and its design considerations
can be found in <<Implementation-ConfigQuiz>>.

[[Implementation-ConfigQuiz]]
=== Configuration and Quiz Mode
As different commands are available for Configuration and Quiz Mode, we have to determine which commands are valid based on
the state of the application. To implement this, we had to examine two main design considerations: The *structure of the parser component* and *how to
determine which parser to use*. We will discuss these considerations in the following segment.

==== Design Considerations
|===
|*Aspect* | *Alternative 1* | *Alternative 2* | *Conclusion and Explanation*
|Structure of the Parser Component
|Command parsers for both modes implement the same interface (i.e. implement both `parse(String)` and `parse(String, Answerable)` methods)
but for the method which is not used, throw an error if a client calls it.
|Command parsers belonging to each mode implement different interfaces (i.e. a `Parser` or `QuizParser` interface)
which dictates the parameters of their parse() methods. (i.e. `parse(String)` for Configuration Mode vs `parse(String, Answerable)` for Quiz Mode)
|*Alternative 2 was implemented.* The main reason for this choice was to adhere to the interface-segregation principle.
If alternative 1 were to be implemented, a Configuration Mode command may have to implement a parse(String, Answerable)
dummy method which it will not use. This is bad design as a client might be able to call the dummy method and receive
unexpected results. Thus, by separating the interfaces, clients will only need to know about the methods that they need.

|Determining which parser to use| Create two parser manager classes (i.e. `QuizParserManager` and `ParserManager`)
with accompanying `QuizLogicManager` and `LogicManager` classes whose methods will be called in `MainWindow` for Configuration Mode and
`StartQuizWindow` for Quiz Mode respectively.
|Use a single `ParserManager` class which has overloaded methods of parse(String) and parse(String, Answerable). A
single `LogicManager` will also implement `execute(String)` and `execute(String, Answerable)`. In Configuration Mode, the
`LogicManager` will call `execute(String)` as there is no need to take in an Answerable and in Quiz Mode, the `LogicManager`
will call `execute(String, Answerable)` to initiate quiz-related commands.
|*Alternative 2 was implemented.* By doing so, we were able to adopt a facade design pattern. The main benefit would be that
the client doesn't need to know the logic involved in selecting which type of parser and logic to use. This hides the internal
complexity of the `ParserManager` class which will be responsible for determining which type of parser to use.
|===

==== Commands in Configuration Mode
In Configuration Mode, a single string is passed as an argument to the Logic#execute method (i.e. `execute(String)`).
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Commands in Quiz Mode
In Quiz Mode, a string and the current `Answerable` object are passed as arguments to the Logic#execute method. (i.e. `execute(String, Answerable)`)
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("c", answerable)` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `c` input command.
image::QuizSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Key differences between Configuration Mode and Quiz Mode:

|===
|*Configuration Mode* | *Quiz Mode*
|Logic#execute takes in a single string. | Logic#execute takes in a String and an Answerable.
|No methods of `Answerable` are called. | `Answerable#isCorrect(Answer)` is called from `AnswerableInputCommand`s such as `McqInputCommand` to check whether the user's answer is correct.
|`CommandResult` is used to display feedback to the user| `CommandResult` is used to display feedback to the user and inform `LogicManager` whether the selected answer is correct.
|`Model` is used to save actions such as the addition/deletion of answerables. | `Model` is used to update the score history statistics.
|===

==== Implementation of `CommandResult` (Builder Design Pattern)
The `CommandResult` class is designed using a builder pattern to allow flexibility of values returned to the `LogicManager`.
To guard against null values, default values are provided to every field in the `CommandResult` class upon construction.
Objects that call `CommandResult` can choose to customise `CommandResult` according to their needs.

Below is a code snippet of the `CommandResultBuilder` and `CommandResult` class:

image::wilfred-commandwithfeedback.png[width=790]
image::wilfred-commandbuild.png[width=790]
image::wilfred-commandresult.png[width=790]

Examples of how to build a CommandResult:
....
CommandResult c = new CommandResultBuilder().withFeedback(message).withExit(true).build();
CommandResult c = new CommandResultBuilder().isCorrect(true).build();
....

==== How the quiz works
After the user has `start` ed the quiz, the application enters Quiz Mode. The following is the flow of events after a quiz
session has started.

.Activity Diagram of a Quiz Session in `NormalMode`
image::QuizSessionActivityDiagram.png[width=790]

*Elaboration of Steps:*

. After the user has started a normal mode quiz. He/she will be prompted to key in their answer.
. If the input is valid, the revision tool will display the subsequent question until the level / entire quiz has ended.
. If the input is invalid, the revision tool will prompt the user to key in their input again with guidance provided on
the commands accepted.
. If the time limit is exceeded (e.g. 30 seconds in Normal Mode), the revision tool will mark the question as wrong and
move on to the next question.
. Once a level has ended, the user will be given the choice to move on to the next level or exit the quiz.
. Once the entire quiz has ended, the user will be given the choice to restart or exit the quiz.

[NOTE]
For Custom Mode, the game play is the same except that user can choose the category, difficulty and timer for the questions. +
For Arcade Mode, when a users enters a wrong answer, the quiz will end.
