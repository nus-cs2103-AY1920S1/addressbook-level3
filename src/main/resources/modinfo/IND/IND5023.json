It will look at management trade-offs between long-term and short-term supply chain decisions. It will also look at inventory management and how companies improve their cash flow using better inventory management and supply chain financing. Participants will also form teams to play a supply chain simulation game using Excel and online modes. The game will require teams to make annual supply chain management decisions that will impact revenue growth, cut costs, and/or manage risks of the company, taking into consideration management trade-offs and both short-term and long-term profitability, in coming up with an overall strategic plan.",
