    "description": "The aim of the course is to give a theoretical and practical introduction into selected analytical methods for the characterization of biomaterials, tissues, biomolecules and immobilized biological molecules. The methods are focused to obtain: structural, topological (e.g. atomic force microscopy), chemical (e.g. spectrometry) and functional (e.g. surface palsmon resonance and bioassays) information for the characterization of biomolecules, biomaterials, tissues and biomodified materials.",
