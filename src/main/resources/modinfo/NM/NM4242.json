    "description": "Technologies are not value-neutral artefacts. This module develops this proposition by providing students with critical theoretical perspectives to examine power relations in media technologies. Students will explore contemporary issues of technoscience through a study of media history, and learn how historical concerns are transformed with modern technological features and structures. Moving through the topics of datafication, algorithms, networking, and ubiquitous computing, students are taught the importance of critical reflection, and the urgency required for ethical inquiry into technological development.",
