    "description": "The objective of this project module is to allow graduate students an opportunity to undertake a substantial project work over a semester. Students may work individually on projects proposed by staff, possibly in collaboration with external companies. The students will have good opportunity to apply what they have learnt to some technical challenges or practical problems, be it researchoriented or software-development. The project will be assessed through a written project report and will be letter-graded.",
