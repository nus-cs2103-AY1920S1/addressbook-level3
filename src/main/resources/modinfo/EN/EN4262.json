    "description": "Students will read Indian Anglophone literary texts in the context of global capitalism and transnational movements and flows. It examines the construction of imaginary homelands, the cultural politics of that homeland and its (re)negotiation in the larger world, the politics of gender, sexuality and the body, and religious and other cultural identities. The trope of \"(dis)possessions\" provides theoretical leverage into and focus on material influences, the trope of the hauntings of cultural memory, the perceived \"contaminations\" of culture, disciplines of the body, and related themes.",
