It will examine (i) the various components of the master plan that integrates the island as one single planning unit which guides the total physical transformation of the island into the contemporary high-rise, high density city, (ii) the melding of the hegemonic one-party parliament and the civil service into an efficient and efficacious urban growth machine, (iii) the societal and cultural developments engendered by six decades of practically continuous national economic growth and (iv) the future of the city state.",
