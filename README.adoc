* ɯeme is a desktop application developed to help meme-lovers who prefer typing over mouse-clicking to manage their memes.
* Ever wanted an app to collect your favorite memes? ɯeme is here for you! You can manage a collection of memes, create you own memes using meme templates and even share memes to your friends. More importantly, you can do all of this faster than a typical mouse-driven application.
