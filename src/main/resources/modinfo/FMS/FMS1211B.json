    "description": "Biological materials such as hair/feather, muscle, skin, and spider silk are mechanically durable and can adapt to changing environmental conditions. Although the different materials have distinct mechanical properties and biological functions and display specific hierarchical structures, they are constructed mainly from proteins with universal conserved building blocks. In this seminar series, we will discuss protein structures at four levels and interactions involved in the structures. Students will explore the relationship between the property of a protein material and the structure of its constituent protein through independent enquiry, discussion, group projects, and presentations.",
