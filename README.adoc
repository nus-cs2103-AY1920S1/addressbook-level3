== Introduction

ORGANice is an organ transplant manager. +
This desktop application aims to facilitate the matching of organ transplants between patients and organ donors in hospitals. +
It is written in Java language in an Object-oriented fashion.

== Motivation

It is undeniable that organ transplantation is one of the most life-changing medical breakthroughs in history. +
For a transplant to be successful, we need to have an organ that matches the receiver. +
Since time is precious during transplant, we aim to provide an organ matching system to efficiently match organs from donors to the patients who need them.
