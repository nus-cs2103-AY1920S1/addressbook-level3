== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event.
Hackathons are difficult to manage manually as they involve different groups of individuals, each
of whom have a different role to play and agenda to fulfill in the Hackathon. Alfred helps streamline
this organisation and management process, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with the logistics
and administrative details of the Hackathon you are organising.

Furthermore, Alfred is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while
maintaining the benefits of having visual responses in a Graphical User Interface.

Interested? Well, head to <<Quick Start>> to get started. We hope Alfred serves you well!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `alfred.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Alfred.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. Alternatively, if you use a Mac, type the command `java -jar alfred.jar`
on terminal in the jar file's directory to open start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some sample commands you can experiment with:

* *`list teams`* : lists teams in the hackathon
* *`add participant n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`* : adds a new participant named `John Doe` to the Hackathon.
* *`delete mentor 3`* : removes the mentor with ID 3 from the hackathon.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Prelude - Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which you need to supply. For example, in `add mentor n/NAME`,
`NAME` is a parameter which you need to specify as the mentor's name, for example `add mentor n/John Doe`.
* You can type the parameters can be in any order. For instance, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
you may input `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` and Alfred will still deem it as an acceptable command.
* Words in {curly braces} indicate values for the command that you need to supply.
For example in the case of `add {mentor/participant/list}`, you can choose to type `add mentor`, `add participant` or `add team`
