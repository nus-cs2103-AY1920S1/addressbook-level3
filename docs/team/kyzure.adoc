== Overview

Tasked to enhance or morph a simple command line interface (CLI) desktop address book application, our team of 5 Computer Science Students decided to morph the program into a calendar scheduling application for students. From the word "Horology", we came up with the name **Horo** for our program. It is capable of maintaining a calendar and to-do list, posting timely reminders for the users.

Here is a screenshot of **Horo**:

I played the role of designing the User Interface (UI) and the logic of how my teammates' code will interact with the UI. The following sections below will display the following morphing I did in detail, including certain documentation added to the User and Developer Guide.

__Note: The following symbols and format are explained as:__

.Symbol and Formats
|===
|`*list*`| A bold text with highlight as well as the change to monospaced indicates a command input by you which is to be executed by the Horo.
|`TimelineView`| A text with highlight as well as monospaced font indicates a component, class or object in the structure of **Horo**

== Summary of contributions

=== Enhancement Ui and Calendar Logic

==== What is it:
There are 3 different UI screens/panels you can switch between: Calendar Panel, List Panel, Log Panel. Each of the panels shows you a different screen provided with different information.

==== What does it do:
This is accessed using the commands calendar, list, log respectively and provides a different screen to you depending on what you wish to see.

==== Why it is necessary:
It provides you a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so you can easily view their Events or Tasks with a simple switch between the views.

=== Code Contributed

==== Sample Code Contributed:
Here is a link:https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=Kyzure&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Kyzure&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[`Repo Sense Link`] that indicates the amount of code I have written for the project. Additionally, our code has an authorship signature, with mine being - `//@@author Kyzure`, or `<!-- @@author Kyzure -$$->$$`. This authorship can be found at the top of any of the class, or method.
