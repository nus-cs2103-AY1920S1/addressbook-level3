    "description": "Creativity seems to be an overused and vague buzzword, though only few would deny its fundamental role in an economic system which relies on innovations as a driving force. So what actually is creative thinking, can we foster it or is it just a matter of inspiration? We will analyze different forms of creativity with examples from history, research, technology and the arts. Then we will practice creative thinking and explore strategies how to manage innovative teams. To show that creative strategic thinking plays a role in various domains of society we turn towards negotiation and deal-making.We conclude with ideas how to communicate new ideas best and a discussion on creative leadership.",
