    "description": "Students doing this course will learn the analytical tools required for understanding various issues that arise in the international economy. It is divided broadly into two sections, the first focusing on the real side of the economy while the second introduces money, covering open economy macroeconomics. Students will learn the workhorse models of the discipline, with reference to the empirical data. In addition, students will be assigned journal articles and/or working papers, which they are expected to read and submit reports on. They will also be expected either to apply a theoretical model to a contemporary problem or do an empirical paper in an area in international economics as a term paper.",
