    "description": "Biodiversity conservation became one of the important environmental themes of global concern after UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The realisation that human development has to complement and not to compete with biological conservation ultimately developed into the famous Agenda 21. This protocol bound all the nations into accepting various responsibilities towards conservation of nature and natural resources. This module is aimed at imparting knowledge to students to help them understand and appreciate various concepts and issues concerning biodiversity and conservation at local, regional and global levels.",
