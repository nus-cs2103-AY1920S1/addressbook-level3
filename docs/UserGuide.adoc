== Introduction

Wish to get the summer body that the contestants in your school’s
beauty pageant has? Want to shed some weight that you have gained
from stress-eating?

Well wait no more! ExerHealth is a one-stop platform for students
who wish to embark on a journey of health and fitness. This application
is optimised for students who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast and wish to maintain a healthy
lifestyle, ExerHealth is that one app for you!

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `stats t/CAT_NAME`,
`CAT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `stats t/exercise`.
* Words in `lower_case` are the compulsory keywords that inform ExerHealth about the category of
information being added. e.g. `add t/exercise n/EXERCISE_NAME`, `t/exercise` is a keyword that informs ExerHealth about adding to the exercise tracker.

or as `d/1/10/2019`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MUSCLE]...`
can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `m/glutes`, `m/glutes m/chest` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE c/CALORIES`,
`d/DATE c/CALORIES n/NAME` is also acceptable.
