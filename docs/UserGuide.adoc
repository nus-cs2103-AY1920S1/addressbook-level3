== Introduction

AlgoBase (AB) is a one-stop management platform for Computer Science students preparing for technical interviews.
**With AlgoBase, say goodbye to tough interview days!**

Tired of having to manually track your progress across multiple websites like Kattis, HackerRank and LeetCode?
AlgoBase allows you to pull practice questions from these online repositories (and more!)
and consolidates them into a single application.

Do you have to prepare for mutliple interviews, and want to customize your preparations for each of them?
We got you covered! AlgoBase also allows you to create highly flexible training plans to tailor to your individual needs.

Are you a guru that has completed many problems, and want a powerful way to filter through your problems? No worries!
AlgoBase comes equipped with a comprehensive tag system and a flexible filtering mechanism for your needs.

Are you used to the speed of Command Line tools and find that Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications are too slow?
Not a problem! AlgoBase is designed for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing algorithm problems,
equipped with a robust Command Line Interface (CLI) while still maintaining the benefits of a GUI.

Interested? Jump to the Section 2 to get an "Overview" of the AlgoBase, or Section 3 “Quick Start” to get started with AlgoBase!

// tag::overview[]
== Overview

AlgoBase is primarily a problem management application, where users can add different algorithm problems from all kinds of sources.
Within the application, users can create training plans consisting of tasks, where each task is a problem that the user has to complete.
Upon completing a task, users can mark it as done, which contributes to the progress of their plan.

The figure below illustrates the layout of the AlgoBase application:

.Layout of AlgoBase
image::gui/AlgoBaseLayout.png[scaledwidth=18cm]

AlgoBase is split into following 3 panes:

** _Display Tabs_ – displays a list of items (problems, tags, plans or find rules)
** _Details Tabs_  – displays details of a specific item
** _Task Management Pane_ – displays details of the current plan
// end::overview[]

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `algobase.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AlgoBase application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.UI of AlgoBase
image::Ui.png[scaledwidth=18cm]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will list all possible commands in the result window and open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listprob`* : lists all problems
* *`addprob n/factorial d/define a function factorial that takes in a number and n and returns the factorial of the number t/recursion a/Halim`* :
adds a problem called 'factorial' tagged with 'recursion' and authored by 'Halim'
* *`editprob 1 src/LeetCode`* : edits the first problem displayed and sets its source to 'LeetCode'
* *`switchtab tt/display i/2`* : switches to tag tab
* *`switchtab tt/display i/3`* : switches to plan tab
* *`findplan n/CS2040`* : finds plans that with name 'CS2040'
* *`donetask plan/1 task/1`* : marks the first task in the first training plan as done
* *`clear`* : resets AlgoBase
* *`exit`* : exits AlgoBase

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addprob n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addprob n/Two Sequences`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/factorial t/recursion` or as `n/factorial`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/recursion`, `t/recursion t/dynamic-programming` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/AUTHOR`, `a/AUTHOR n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If there are duplicate parameters, and the command format doesn't expect multiple parameters of the same name (i.e. having `...` in its format), *AlgoBase* will only consider the last parameter and ignore previous parameters (with the same parameter name). e.g. `addprob n/nameA n/nameB` will add a problem with name `nameB`.
====

=== Problems

==== Adding a problem: `addprob`

Generates a new problem. +
Format: `addprob n/NAME [a/AUTHOR] [w/WEBLINK] [d/DESCRIPTION] [diff/DIFFICULTY] [src/SOURCE] [t/TAG]...`

* `DIFFICULTY` should be an integer or decimal in the range of (0, 5] (If no difficulty is provided, *AlgoBase* will internally store the difficulty as 0)

[NOTE]
Don't provide extreme values like `5.00000...01` as difficulty as computers can't store decimals exactly and some round-off error is unavoidable.

[TIP]
A problem can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `addprob n/Sequences a/Tung Kam Chuen w/https://open.kattis.com/problems/sequences d/Find the sum of the number of inversions of the 2k sequences, modulo 1000000007 (109+7). diff/3.0 src/Kattis t/recursion`

==== Deleting a problem : `deleteprob`

Deletes an existing problem. +
Format: `deleteprob INDEX [f/]`

* Deletes the problem with the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

[NOTE]
The command will fail if the problem identified by `INDEX` is used in some task(s) in existing plans.
Add `f/` to force AlgoBase to delete all tasks associated with the problem.

Examples:

* `listprob` +
`deleteprob 2` +
Deletes the second problem in the displayed list.
* `findprob n/factorial` +
`deleteprob 1` +
Deletes the first problem in the results of the `findprob` command.

==== Editing a problem : `editprob`

Edits an existing problem. +
Format: `editprob INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [a/AUTHOR] [t/TAG]...`

* Edits the problem at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed problem list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the problem will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the problem's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

* `editprob 1 a/John Doe` +
Edits the author of the first problem to be `John Doe` respectively.
* `editprob 2 n/permutations t/` +
Edits the name of the second problem to be `permutations` and clears all existing tags.

==== Listing all problems : `listprob`

Displays a list of all existing problems. +
Format: `listprob`

// tag::sort[]
==== Sorting problems: `sortprob`

Sorts the current list of **problems** by a specified method and order. +
Format: `sortprob m/METHOD [ord/ORDER]`

* `METHOD` can be `name`, `author`, `weblink`, `difficulty` or `source`.
* `ORDER` can be `ascend` or `descend` representing ascending and descending order. The default is in ascending order.
* String-based values (i.e. `name`, `author`, etc.) are sorted alphabetically.

[NOTE]
If sorted by ascending order (i.e. the default order), empty fields will have the highest priority, which means if you execute `sortprob m/weblink`, the first few results would be (if any) without web links.

Examples:

* `sortprob m/name`
Sorts the current list of problems in ascending order of names.
* `sortprob m/author ord/descend`
Sorts the current list of problems in descending order of author names.
* `sortprob m/difficulty ord/ascend`
Sorts the current list of problems from lowest to highest difficulty.
// end::sort[]

=== Searching Problems
// tag::find[]
==== Locating problems: `findprob`

Finds problems fulfilling all provided constraints. +
Format: `findprob [n/NAME] [a/AUTHOR] [d/DESCRIPTION] [src/SOURCE] [diff/LOWER_BOUND-UPPER_BOUND] [t/TAG_KEYWORDS]`

.The result of `findprob` is shown in the problems list
image::findprob_1.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=18cm]

[NOTE]
When providing the search restrictions, you should ensure that keywords are non-blank and difficulty range is valid (as specified in `addprob` command). Also at least one search restriction should be provided.

* Name
** is case-insensitive. e.g. `henz` will match `Henz`
** is considered a match as long as one word matches. (e.g. `Henz Ben` matches both `Martin Henz` and `Ben Leong`)
** is matched word by word. e.g. `hello` will match `hello world` but not `helloworld`
* Author requires an exact match.
* Description
** is case-insensitive
** is matched word by word
** is considered as a match only when the problem's description includes all words in the constraint. e.g. `wordA wordB` matches `wordC wordB wordA` not `wordD wordA`

[NOTE]
Words are separated by empty spaces. Thus if we have a sentence "Hello, world!", we have two words `Hello,` and `world!`.

* Source requires an exact match.
* Tag
** Constraints are separated by spaces. (e.g. `findprob t/Recursion Brute-Force` will display all problems with both tag `Recursion` and `Brute-Force`)
** Constraint tag set is a subset of matching problems. (e.g. `findprob t/Recursion Brute-Force` will match problem with tags `Recursion`+`Brute-Force`+`Playful` but not `Recursion`+`Adhoc`)
** Two tags are considered equal only when their tag strings are exactly matched.
* Difficulty
** matches problems with `LOWER_BOUND \<= difficulty \<= UPPER_BOUND`

[TIP]
If you want to match problems with exact difficulty `1.5`, please use `diff/1.5-1.5`. +
If you want to match problems with with difficulty no lower than `1.5`, please use `diff/1.5-5.0` because `5.0` is the upper limit of difficulty.

[NOTE]
Note that negative difficulty is not allowed, as mentioned before. Otherwise the command may be considered invalid.

Examples:

* `findprob n/Sequences` +
Returns any problem with word `Sequences` (case-insensitive) in its name.
* `findprob t/algorithm diff/2.0-4.0` +
Returns any problem with `algorithm` as one of its tags **AND** with a difficulty between 2.0 and 4.0 (inclusive).
* `findprob a/Hentin Marz src/Kattis` +
Returns any problem from `Kattis` that's authored by `Hentin Marz`.
// end::find[]

// tag::findrule[]
==== Storing a problem-finding rule: `addfindrule`

Saves a problem-finding rule from provided constraints. +
Format: `addfindrule RULE_NAME [n/NAME] [a/AUTHOR] [d/DESCRIPTION] [src/SOURCE] [diff/LOWER_BOUND-UPPER_BOUND] [t/TAG_KEYWORDS]` +
Alias: `afr`

.Information related to find rules is displayed in the "Find Rules" panel
image::find_rule_1.png[width="70%", scaledwidth=12cm]

[TIP]
If you want to "keep a list of problems" that fulfills certain conditions, say "graph theory questions from Kattis", you may store these rules using `addfindrule` and `apply` them later. +
Unlike plans, as you add new questions to AlgoBase, so long as the new questions fulfill the search rule, they will show up if you `apply` that rule.

[NOTE]
The rules for constraints are the same as those described in `findprob` command. Note that keywords in a find rule may be less restrictive than the fields (e.g. name, source, etc.).

Examples:

* `addfindrule MediumDiffAlgo t/algorithm diff/2.0-4.0` +
Adds a new find rule named `MediumDiffAlgo` that when applied, returns any problem with `algorithm` as one of its tags AND with a difficulty between 2.0 and 4.0 (inclusive).
* `addfindrule Kattis src/Kattis` or `afr Kattis src/Kattis` +
Adds a new find rule named `Kattis` that when applied, returns any problem from `Kattis`.

==== Applying a problem-finding rule: `apply`

Applies a problem-finding rule. +
Format: `apply INDEX`

* Applies the find rule at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed find rule list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

[TIP]
You can find problem-finding rules that you can `apply` with in the "Find Rules" panel by clicking on the "Find Rules" tab.

[NOTE]
`apply` a problem-finding rule is essentially the same as executing a pre-filled `findprob` command.

Examples:

* `apply 2` +
Applies the second find rule in the displayed list.

==== Deleting a problem-finding rule: `deletefindrule`

Deletes a problem-finding rule. +
Format: `deletefindrule INDEX` +
Alias: `dfr`

* Deletes the find rule at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed find rule list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `deletefindrule 2` or `dfr 2` +
Deletes the second find rule in the displayed list.
// end::findrule[]

// tag::tag[]
=== Tags

==== Creating new tags: `addtag`

Generates a new tag. +
Format: `addtag t/NAME [c/COLOR]`

Examples:

* `addtag t/graph`
* `addtag t/sssp c/BLUE`

[NOTE]
Tag color can only be "RED" "ORANGE" "YELLOW" "GREEN" "BLUE" "PURPLE" "TEAL" "BLACK" or "DEFAULT".

==== Listing tags: `listtag`

Displays a list of all existing tags. +
Format: `listtag`

=== Training Plans

Training plans consist of wrapped-up problems which we call `task` s.

==== Adding a plan: `addplan`

Generates a new plan. +
Format: `addplan n/NAME [d/DESCRIPTION] [start/START_DATE] [end/END_DATE]`

* Plans cannot have duplicate names.
* `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` should be in the format of `yyyy-MM-dd`
* `START_DATE` should be before or equal to `END_DATE`.
* `START_DATE` will be set to `LocalDate#now()` if not specified, and `END_DATE` will be one month from `START_DATE` if not specified.

Examples:

* `addplan n/CS2040 d/past year questions in practical exams start/2019-01-01 end/3019-12-12`

==== Deleting a plan : `deleteplan`

Deletes an existing plan. +
Format: `deleteplan INDEX`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* `START_DATE` should be before or equal to `END_DATE`.
* The time range of the edited plan should cover due dates of its tasks. However, adding `f/` will force inconsistent due dates to change to the plan's end date.

Examples:

* `editplan 1 d/past year questions of sit-in labs` +
Edits the description of the first plan to be `past year questions of sit-in labs` respectively.
* `editplan 2 start/2019-08-13 f/` +
Edits the starting date of the second plan to be `2019-08-13` and any task with due date before `2019-08-13` to the plan's end date.

=== Graphical User Interface (GUI) Enhancements

AlgoBase currently supports several GUI features with an intuitive layout, including the following:

* Opening, Closing and Switching between Tabs
* Editing a Problem or Plan
* Deleting a Problem or Plan

==== Managing Tabs

There are 3 types of tabs in AlgoBase, 2 of which (Display and Details) are shown in the figure below.

.Types of tabs and their usage
image::gui/TabsOverview1.png[width=70%, scaledwidth=12cm]

* **Display tabs** give a high level overview of the contents of a list of items
* **Details tabs** give a more detailed description of an item in a display tab.

Much like tabs you see in other applications, tabs in AlgoBase work the same way.

* To Switch Tabs – Click on a tab to switch tabs
* To Open a Tab – Double click on an item in the Display tab to open it in the Details tab
* To Close a Tab – Click on the `x` button next to a Details tab to close it.

[NOTE]
Display Tabs cannot be closed.

==== Editing a Problem or Plan

The following steps show how a user can edit problems or plans from the GUI.

**Step 1:** Select the problem or plan you want to delete by double clicking on it.
