== PROJECT: AlgoBase

== Overview

AlgoBase is a desktop algorithmic problem manager.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=jiayushe[View on RepoSense]]

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented task management feature
** What it does:
This feature allows the user to keep track of the problems to be done as upcoming tasks in separate plans
and thus manage his/her progress for each plan.
** Justification:
Task management is the core feature of AlgoBase.
It allows the user to manage the problems as tasks in separate plans for different purposes,
such as interviews for different companies or different rounds,
instead of managing all problems stored in the database all together.
By introducing the notion of tasks, user can add more details to the problems
such as due dates and whether each problem has been solved, without modifying the original problems.
This adds significant value to AlgoBase as an algorithmic problem manager.
** Highlights:
*** This feature involves full-stack development in all five main components in AlgoBase,
including `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage`, `Ui` and `UiLogic`.
*** This feature is highly coupled with the problem tracking feature and training plan feature.
It requires in-depth analysis of all existing features in order to avoid unintended behaviours.
*** For example, since each task stores a problem, when a problem is deleted or updated,
all corresponding tasks in all plans need to be deleted or updated simultaneously.
*** Moreover, to avoid user mistakes when deleting problems that are used in some tasks,
which may cause additional overhead to bring back the tasks,
a distinction between normal mode and "forced" mode is introduced to reduce such risks.
(User command to delete problems that are used in tasks will fail gracefully,
unless a "forced" flag is added to the end of his/her command to enable "forced" mode.)
*** A task management pane is also added in the main display
to allow user direct and convenient access to the current plan he/she is doing.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented data management feature +
It allows the user to export their data into JSON format and import new data from JSON files.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.1`, `v1.3.2` and `v1.3.3` (3 releases) on GitHub
*** Updated logo of AlgoBase

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Implement relational storage of models in database [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-1/main/pull/80[#80]] +
This allows integrity check on the storage file upon each launch of AlgoBase.

** Documentation:
*** Updated documentation for UI, Logic and Storage in Developer Guide
*** Added documentation for Task Management feature in Developer Guide and User Guide
