    "description": "No one can say that the Cold War has ended yet in East Asia. But rather a number of the contemporary intra\u2010regional tensions in East Asia stem from the Cold War era; from the tensions over the Taiwan Straits, to the temporary cease\u2010fire status between North and South Korea, to the constitutional controversy in Japan. With a special emphasis on the international dimension, this module explores how the Cold War confrontation (1945\u2010present) has unfolded in the historical context of East Asia over the past decades.",
