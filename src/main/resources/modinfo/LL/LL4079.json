In particular, it examines: the formation and evolution of the Company and the legal implications of its ambiguous status as a private or public entity; its transformation into a sovereign power in India against the backdrop of the rise of the modern state and modern constitutionalism in Europe and the United States of America; and the Company\u2019s role in the founding of modern Singapore; and the Company\u2019s demise in 1858.",
