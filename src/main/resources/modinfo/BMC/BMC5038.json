    "description": "This course is based on conceptual frameworks and the best practice of organizational management and change management. The module intends to help students to develop their conceptual frameworks on organization and change and provide opportunities for them to harness their change management skills. The module has a strong practical component of consultation. Students in one class will form teams, which will be paired with focal companies that are ran or own by students from the same class. Through field visit, interview, survey, and focus group discussion in focal companies, students will gain deep understanding of the strategy and operation of the organizations. The student team will provide diagnosis and consultation to companies to improve their organization and change management. The student team will focus on one or two topics in their consultation work from five key themes including organizational control, talent management, performance management, high performance work team and organizational culture and value.",
