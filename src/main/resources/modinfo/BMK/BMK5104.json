    "description": "Today's businesses are bombarded with data. It is a key skill to be able to tell a story from this data so that businesses can leverage on market intelligence for marketing effectiveness. To achieve this objective, this module is designed with two integrated components: 1) data visualization, and 2) marketing strategy. We will start with understanding how humans interpret and perceive visual cues. Then, we introduce various tools and techniques for visualization. Subsequently, we apply these insights obtained to learn how to maximize the impact on communication to win the buy-in of the relevant decision makers within the organization.",
