    "description": "Pharmacovigilance is one of the key regulatory functions, and monitors the safe effective use of pharmaceuticals in the real-world healthcare setting. It drives the source of real-world evidence that feedbacks into the regulatory decision-making process, contributes to timely postapproval actions and completes the product life cycle management. This 4-credit module introduces the principles of pharmacovigilance, regional and global frameworks, as well as the pivotal processes involved in optimal data collection, collation and signal generation.
