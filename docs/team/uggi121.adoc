== PROJECT: Typee


== Overview

We are a group of 5 NUS Computer Science students involved in enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop
application that manages addresses for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an appointment
management application called *_Typee_*.


*_Typee_* is a CLI application that allows secretaries and receptionists to better schedule and
manage appointments. Receptionists and secretaries possess one of the fastest typing speeds and would get increased
productivity using the CLI-based *_Typee_*. The CLI application boosts productivity by having a comprehensive
appointment management system with interactive parsing, calendar view, pdf report generation, as well as a typing game.

====

=== Major enhancement: added Interactive Parsing
** [red]#*_What it does:_* -# Interactive parsing allows the users to interact with the application to enter commands. This
feature makes it possible for users to enter arguments to commands sequentially, instead of entering the entire command in one shot.

** [red]#*_Justification:_* -# Interactive parsing is a crucial feature that allows new and amateur users to get accustomed to the
application. For example, the `Add` command has 7 parameters that the user must know to invoke. Interactive parsing makes Typee prompt
the users for the correct input, step by step, to ensure that they don't have to remember the command format. This feature is also *versatile*
because experienced users can still enter the full/partial command in one shot, if they remember the format of the command or parts of it.

** [red]#*_Highlights:_* -# This feature required me to replace the *entire* `Parser` package that was in present in `AddressBook 3`. I was
pushed to the boundaries of my knowledge and had to adhere to good design patterns to re-implement the package.

** [red]#*_Depth_* -# Interactive Parsing is a very deep feature. Each command's parser is a fully implemented finite state machine with a state for each parameter of the command.
Moreover, the interactive parser's design conforms to the *state pattern* documented by the *Gang of Four*. This necessitated skillful use of
abstract classes, interfaces and polymorphism.

** [red]#*_Completeness_* -# Users can:
*** enter the arguments of a command step-by-step
*** enter the entire command in one shot
*** mix both worlds and enter a partially completed command with some, but not all arguments
*** switch tabs in between commands

** [red]#*_Effort_* -# The entire `Parser` package required extending `ArgumentMultimap`, along with the creation of several state machines,
each with one or more states. This feature necessitated a few thousand lines of code to be written. Moreover, care was taken to
develop the `Parser` such that future developers can easily add parsing for new `Commands`.

=== Minor enhancement: added `add` command
** [red]#*_What it does:_* -# Adds an appointment, meeting or an interview at the specified time-slot and venue.

** [red]#*_Justification:_* -# Secretaries and receptionists primarily manage engagements. The first step in managing engagements is to be able to add them.
This feature is crucial in managing engagements effectively and efficiently.

** [red]#*_Highlights_* -#
*** This enhancement required implementing a new `Engagement` package to functionally replace the `Person` package from AB3.
*** An engagement that clashes with another existing engagement will not be addable.
*** Due to the nature of the class `AttendeeList`, Java's *Stream API* was utilized in several methods.

** [red]#*_Depth_* -# A new package, `engagement` had to be created for this feature. `Engagement` has 7 fields, which necessitated
the creation of 7 classes to encapsulate the information. Along with the creation of the classes, engagement conflict checking was
implemented.

** [red]#*_Completeness_* -# In order to complete this feature, an entire overhaul of the `Storage` package, including the Json format
was necessary. This was done along with refactoring of several other components of `Model`. Last but not least, the `Ui` had to be
tweaked to accommodate the display of engagements in place of addresses.

** [red]#*_Effort_* -# Implementation of this feature demanded refactoring of four components, namely `Model`, `Storage`, `Ui` and `Logic`.
Carrying out the aforementioned changes was an elaborate, demanding and structured process.

=== Interactive Parsing

==== About

Typically, engagement managing software require users to enter the entire command in one shot.

For example, a user that wishes to add a meeting must type out the following: -
`add t/meeting s/16/11/2019/1500 e/16/11/2019/1600 l/Meeting Room 2 d/Team Meeting a/John | Smith p/High`

This can prove to be rather tedious and cumbersome as users must remember every detail of a command.

Typee overcomes this by allowing users to interact with its interface and build commands sequentially. Users just need
to type the relevant command word to get prompted about subsequent inputs.

.The interactive component of Typee is highlighted above.

With interactive parsing, the aforementioned 'Add' command reduces to the following sequence of inputs: -
```
add
t/meeting
s/16/11/2019/1500
e/16/11/2019/1600
l/Meeting Room 2
d/Team Meeting
a/John | Smith
p/High
```

.Typee's prompt in response to the user entering `add`

{empty} +

Experienced users that have a grasp of the structure and format of various commands can also benefit from this feature.
Interactive parsing allows multiple arguments to be input simultaneously, as long as the entered arguments adhere to a
set of rules detailed in a later subsection.

The same 'Add' command can be constructed this way by a fairly experienced user: -
```
add t/meeting
s/16/11/2019/1500 e/16/11/2019/1600 l/Meeting Room 2
d/Team Meeting
a/John | Smith p/High
```

.A user about to pass 3 arguments to Typee in one input, following `add`.

{empty} +

.Typee's response to the above input.
image::interactive_parsing_3.png[height='90' width='800']
{empty} +

Finally, a highly experienced user can create an 'Add' command in the conventional manner, i.e. by typing out
the entire command at once. This is identical to the format introduced in the beginning of this section: -
`add t/meeting s/16/11/2019/1500 e/16/11/2019/1600 l/Meeting Room 2 d/Team Meeting a/John | Smith p/High`


==== Supported Commands

*All commands* are parsed and built interactively. Each command, however, adheres to its own structure. Individual commands'
structures and idiosyncrasies are detailed in the sections belonging to the respective commands.

In general, commands are of two types - *static* and *dynamic*.

At any point of time, the user can enter `// current` to view the current input constraints and
input `// clear` to stop parsing the current command. These are examples of *dynamic* commands.

Static commands are executed one at a time, whereas dynamic commands can be built at any point of time, even while
parsing an ongoing static command.

Examples:

'Add' and 'Delete' are static commands. The following input sequence is invalid: -
```
add t/meeting
delete
```

'Help' and 'Exit' are dynamic commands. Therefore, the following input sequence is *valid*: -

```
add t/meeting
help
s/11/01/2019/1500
exit
```

[NOTE]
Calling another dynamic command in the midst of building a `Tab` command will erase the details of the command preceding
'Tab'. This happens if the command preceding `Tab` isn't fully built. +
For example: `add t/meeting` `tab` `// current` `b/calendar` will erase the information of the add command.

==== Valid Input Sequences

Valid input sequences can be one of three types.

* One argument per input - `add` `t/meeting` ... `p/high`
* Entire command in an input - `add t/meeting s/11/01/2019/1600 ... p/High`
* More than one argument, but not the entire command in an input - `add t/meeting` `s/11/01/2019/1600 e/11/01/2019/1700` ...

After the last argument is specified, the required command is built and executed, carrying out the operation
intended by the user.

*The order of arguments entered is important*. Consider the 'Add' command. The ideal ordering is as follows: -
`add t/ s/ e/ l/ d/ a/ p/`

When users resort to any of the three aforementioned forms of supplying arguments, they are required to conform to the
specified ordering.

When the arguments aren't in order, then the input is *parsed as far as possible, in the expected order of the arguments*.

For example, `add t/meeting l/Meeting Room 2` is parsed till the argument for `t/`. The parameter location is deemed
invalid and the user is prompted to enter a start date-time.

This happens because the parser expects an argument for `s/`, but there is no such argument.
As a consequence, all arguments that are supposed to be entered after `s/` (like `l/`) are not parsed.

.Typee's response to `add t/meeting l/Meeting Room 2`.

{empty} +


Similarly, `add t/meeting s/15/01/2019/1500 d/desc p/low` is parsed till `s/` and a prompt is raised to enter a valid end date-time, leaving `d/`
and `p/` untouched.

.Typee's response to `add t/meeting s/15/01/2019/1500 d/desc p/low`.
image::interactive_parsing_7.png[width='800' height='90']
{empty} +


[NOTE]
There lies a quirk with respect to the ordering of inputs if the parser has sufficient arguments. +
Consider the case when the user inputs `add t/meeting e/15/11/2019/1500 s/15/11/2019/1400`. This input is deemed *valid* even
though `e/` and `s/` are flipped. This is because after 't/', the parser expects to find an `s/`, which is in-turn contained in the input.


*Thus, to summarize, the parser continues parsing in the order of the expected arguments, as long as the corresponding prefixes are found in the input.*

==== Erroneous Inputs

Erroneous inputs occur in three mutually exclusive categories.

* Inputs with invalid arguments
* Inputs with multiple arguments for the same parameter.
* Inputs with valid arguments, but irrelevant additional arguments.

An example of the first case is as follows: `add t/teeming`. "Teeming" is an invalid engagement type. Typee flags this inaccuracy
and prompts the user to enter an acceptable engagement type instead. Since Typee has already begun building an 'Add' command,
the subsequent input must begin with `t/...`

.A user about to enter an invalid input.

{empty} +

.Typee's response to the invalid input.
image::interactive_parsing_5.png[height='90' width='800']
{empty} +


Attempting to replace the argument for a parameter or supply different arguments to the same parameter will result in Typee rejecting
the user input.

For example, the input `add t/meeting t/interview` will be rejected.

The following sequence will also be rejected since it attempts to overwrite an argument.
```
add
t/meeting
s/15/11/2019/1500
t/interview
```

Last but not least, Typee will reject cases wherein the user supplies excessive and irrelevant arguments.
`add t/meeting s/16/11/2019/1600 e/16/11/2019/1700 l/COM-1 d/Meeting a/Damith p/High o/High` will be rejected because `o/`
is not a parameter for the 'Add' command.
