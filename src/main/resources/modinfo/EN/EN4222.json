    "description": "This module explores the broader significance and implications of new tendencies that arose in the eighteenth century, and the ways in which they herald the concerns of the modern world. Part one explores the tension between religion, science, and philosophy in the prose and poetry of the early eighteenth century, and the impact that new ways of conceiving the world had on social, cultural, intellectual and religious thinking. Part two explores the tension between tradition and individual expression in the poetry and painting of the second half of the century, and the variety of ways in which they reveal a new sensibility.",
