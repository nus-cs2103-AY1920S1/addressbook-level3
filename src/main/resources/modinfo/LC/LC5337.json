    "description": "The Singapore legal system resides in the common law family but has its own history and development. This course introduces civil law lawyers to the methodology and reasoning used in the common law in Singapore - using the lens of contract law, a part of private obligations relevant to commercial transactions as well as daily life. By exploring introductory-level aspects of contract law, such as formation and the creation of rights and obligations, interpretation, breach, and remedies, the course also examines how policy concerns of certainty and fairness, as well as aspects of common law, shape outcomes and legal rules.",
