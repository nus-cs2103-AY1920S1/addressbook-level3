That’s why we created KeyboardFlashCards: a highly efficient flashcard manager catered to the fastest typists, saving time for the optimal learning experience.

* This is a desktop Flashcard management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
