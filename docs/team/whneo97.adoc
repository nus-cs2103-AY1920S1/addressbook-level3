== PROJECT: SugarMummy

---

== Overview

SugarMummy is a desktop application used to manage a type-II diabetic lifestyle. The user interacts with it using a CLI,
and it has a GUI created with JavaFx. It is written in Java and has about 30 kLOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability for the application to provide a personalised user experience for the
user.*
** What it does: Allows the user to:
. View, add, edit and clear his / her biography.
. Attain different levels of achievements upon meeting predefined requirements.
. Customise font and background to _any_ hexadecimal-value colour (or image for background).
** Justification: These features improve the product significantly because a user would want to add a user  profile with useful information especially in times of emergency, acquire a sense of achievement at different milestones, and enjoy a substantial degree of flexibility in aesthetic customisation, representing his / her preferences, that enhances his / her overall quality of comfort in using the app.
** Highlights: These enhancements benefit commands to be added in future since new fields in a user's biography, achievements and aesthetic preferences could be easily defined in further developments via inheritance and polymorphism. Implementation of the `Achievements` sub-feature was particularly challenging as it required careful interaction with other features such as the `Average` feature and
`Record` instances, in addition to maintaining balance between abstraction and minimising coupling.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added over 600+ motivational quotes from various sources to be selected at random and shown to the user for each session of the main application's execution.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=whneo97[View RepoSense]]
