    "description": "This module examines the impact of new media content in health communication, particularly theories and concepts about health behavior outcomes, and strategic use of media channels for interventions in an environment of user\u2010generated media and blogs. It examines the implications for public health of profound changes in the media marketplace, including the shift from unidirectional, expert\u2010controlled communication to consumer\u2010initiated and interactive communication; the growth of social networking, and the proliferation of media sources. It focuses on how new media can be leveraged to build grassroots engagement, promote policy advocacy, and build environments that are supportive of healthy behavior change.",
