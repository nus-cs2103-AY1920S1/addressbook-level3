    "description": "This module proposes to examine the processes of globalization and seeks to provide a deeper understanding of it. The world is globalizing both culturally and economically. We need to ask whether this process is creating a single world without borders or intensifying cultural differences between societies. By discussing various trends of the interdependent world, the course helps us in understanding the various processes of globalization. Since the processes of globalization involve societal, cultural, technological, political, and economic processes, we will take an inter-disciplinary framework in understanding this diverse experience. The course will specifically highlight the problems and prospects of the contemporary world",
