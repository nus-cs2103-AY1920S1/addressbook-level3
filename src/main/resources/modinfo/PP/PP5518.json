    "description": "The idea that \u2018pragmatism\u2019 accounts for Singapore\u2019s successful development and governance is at the heart of the Singapore model. But its practical meaning \u2013 even in the most seemingly technocratic policy examples \u2013 has been multiple, unstable, contradictory, and increasingly ideological in an age of neoliberal globalization, when the market often gets to dictate what counts as pragmatic, and often in ways that obscure and thus secure elite interests. This module explores the policy and legislative debates surrounding: (1) Sex, including prostitution, homosexuality, and procreation; (2) Addiction, including drug use, gambling, and smoking; and (3) Censorship of the arts and popular culture.",
