    "description": "NUS Law has a rich tradition of pro bono work among staff and students. Engaging in pro bono provides an opportunity to gain 'real world' experience - to see firsthand the important role law plays in the life of an individual. Law is a privileged profession, one that assists in upholding and promoting justice, morality and the rule of law. This module sets a baseline for pro bono service at NUS, aimed at helping students develop professional skills, and exposing students to the non\u2010pecuniary aspects of the profession that will sustain a long and satisfying career.",
