    "description": "Calculus unites the study of instantaneous rates of change, area and optimisation, via the mathematical concepts of limit and infinity. This module provides a conceptual framework for Calculus. We eschew full mathematical rigour, but emphasise real world phenomena more than the rote formal calculations that make up a typical high school Calculus class. This module is suitable not only for those who have never learned Calculus before, but also for those who have completed a high school Calculus course. Students completing the module will be prepared for discipline-specific classes in the Sciences and Social Sciences which make use of Calculus.",
