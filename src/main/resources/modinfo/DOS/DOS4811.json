    "description": "Visualization is an invaluable tool for supporting analysis and decision making in modern business. Students will: (i) manipulate relational data sets, aggregate the data and generate visual representations; (ii) build a thorough understanding of data aggregation processes; (iii) learn to use interactivity to support data exploration and counterfactual ('what-if') analysis; and (iv) learn how to communicate ideas effectively with data. This course will include a substantial hands-on-learning component, and supports the development of highly marketable skills in visualization. Applications will be drawn from operations, supply chain management and other aspects of business.",
