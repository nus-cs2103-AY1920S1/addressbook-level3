    "description": "'Form,' a wonderfully broad and slippery term, is often used to describe the way a poem deploys its line, rhythm, sound, and how it\u2019s arranged on the page. But form might also describe an ideological project, an organizing idea, what reoccurs and what is conspicuously absent. Students will explore the fundamentals of poetic form, but also interrogate form as a shape of feeling, a rendering of experience in verse, a kind of witnessing of the self and the world. Attention will be paid to contemporary forms of poetry which engage with the visual world through text and image.",
