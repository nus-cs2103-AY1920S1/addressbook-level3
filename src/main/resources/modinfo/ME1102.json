    "description": "This is part 1 of a 2-module package \u2013 Engineering\nPrinciples and Practice - that introduces Year 1 students\nto what engineers do and the engineer's thought process.\nEPP I focuses on the engineering principles of how\nsystems work and fail, and the engineering practice of\nhow they are designed, built and valued. Given a\npractical engineering system, e.g. a drone, or an\nengineering event, e.g. the Challenger space shuttle\ndisaster, students are guided to deconstruct the system\ninto inter-connected sub-systems. Following which they\nwill develop an understanding of how forces, energy flow\nand/or mass flow between sub-systems impact the whole.",
