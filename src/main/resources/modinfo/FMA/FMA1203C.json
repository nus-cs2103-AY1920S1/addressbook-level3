    "description": "All big cities have several things in common \u2013 wealth creation, big companies, talented people, high population density and the challenge of air pollution. New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, all face similar challenges of high population density and quality of living. This module will examine how more people can be packed into a limited city space while still providing the same quality of life. It will also explore how to achieve economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a 'Green Planet'. Students will learn about smart city planning, design concepts, technology enablers and implementation considerations for smart city living.",
