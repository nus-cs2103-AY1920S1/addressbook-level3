=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

* The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntryListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

* The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Guilt Trip data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage`

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.
* This includes instances of Entry subclasses(Expense, Income, Wish, AutoExpenditure, Budget, TrackerReminder, etc.)
* DateReminder data are stored in Entry data.

[[Design-Statistics]]
=== Statistics component

.Structure of the Statistics Component
image::StatisticsClass.png[]

.  `Statistics` contains an ObservableMap of `MonthlyList` class.
.  `MonthlyList` contains an ObservableMap of `DailyList` class.
.  `DailyList` contains an ObservableMap of `CategoryList` class.
.  These lists are populated when the guiltTrip() is started up and the content is retrieved from Storage.
.  Any added entries are updated in the `CategoryList` and `DailyList` classes.

== Implementation
This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Data Presentation: Sort Command

==== Implementation

The sort command extends the Command class. It works on the SortedList by adding a Comparator to the List. By default, the EntryList is sorted by date.

. The user executes the command `sort typ/Expense s/ascending`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `SortCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `SortCommand` calls the `Model` 's sortFilteredEntryList to sort the list of entries.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("sort typ/Expense s/ascending")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::SortSequence.png[]

=== ViewHistory Command

==== Implementation

The viewHistory command extends the Command class. It calls methods from the Statistics Manager which handles the calculation of the statistics and returns it to the user.

. The user executes the command `viewHistory typ/Expense`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `viewHistoryCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `viewHistoryCommand` calls the `Model` 's generateHistory method which calls on the `StatisticsManager` generateHistory method to calculate the statistics for that type.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("viewHistory typ/Expense")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `viewHistory typ/Expense` Command
image::viewHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Toggle Panel Command

==== Implementation

The `toggle` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the `CommandResult` obtained from `Logic`
if the user wants to toggle a specified panel. If so, it toggles the `isVisible` and `isManaged` properties of the place
holder for that panel.


The following sequence diagram shows how the toggle panel command work:

image::ToggleSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::ToggleActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Current method:* Toggle the panels from within MainWindow class.

Pros: Easy to implement.

Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.

=== ListFont Command


=== ChangeFontCommand

=== Reminders

==== Implementation
The reminders implementation is facilitated by the reminder class, and heavily makes use of the observable pattern to keep track with property changes in the GuilTrip model to display messages in a timely fashion.

For instance, the class diagram above shows the relation between the classes that help to implement the reminder feature.
There are 2 types of reminders. General and entry reminders. General reminders are not tied to any specific entry, and sent the user notifications whenever an entry matching the user specified conditions is entered in the app. These specified conditions include entry type, a lower and upper quota for the entry amount, a specified time period in which an entry takes place, or a list of tags which the entry must have.

The sequence diagram above illustrates what happens when an entry fulfils all conditions in an entry.
When an expense is logged in to GuiltTrip.java, in addition to being stored in the Expense List, the expense is also passed into the Condition Manager, which iterates through its list of conditions to see which conditions are met by the entry. Each condition makes use of a self-implemented ObservableSupport class that enables it to function as an Observable object, with the reminders being its listeners. When a condition is met, it notifies the reminder it belongs to. The reminders keep track of the number of conditions met, and only when all conditions are met does it make use of ObservableSupport to notify the reminderlist about a change in its status. The reminder list generates a notification corresponding to the reminder and adds it to an observable list which is displayed by the Ui. The number of conditions met is reset a the end of the process so the reminders may continue to produce notifications when subsequent entries meeting the requirements are keyed into the system.

An entry reminder targets a specific expense/ income or wish. It is set to send notifications at a specified period at specified intervals before the date of the event.  This is made possible with TimeUtil, which is a singleton class with a single instance checking the local date at periodic intervals and updating its listeners (Using the ObservableSupport) of the current date. All entry reminders are listeners of TimeUtil. Similar to General Reminder, when it is time to send a notification, it notifies the reminder list which generates a corresponding notification and sets the next date to notify the user. Once the date of the event itself has passed, the reminder is deactivated and not saved the next time GuiltTrip is closed.

=== Design Considerations:
1)	Alternative 1 (current method): Users must first select a reminder before they can edit or remove reminders.
Pros: Easier to implement. By automatically toggling the reminder list view on when selecting a reminder, the user also will see what reminder they have selected before they proceed to make any changes. (As opposed to selecting and modifying the reminder in a single command).
Cons: Involves one more step. Not as efficient.

2)	Alternative 2: Users commands require an index argument to indicate the reminder to modify.
Pros: Faster as it involves one less step. May be more convenient for users who frequently forget to first select reminder to modify.
Cons: Aforementioned benefits are mitigated as reminders are hidden in default GUI settings, and most users will have to open up the reminderList to know which reminder to modify anyway.

=== Undo/ Redo

==== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
It extends `GuiltTrip` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `guiltTripStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGuiltTrip#commit()` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#undo()` -- Restores the previous finance trackerk state from its history.
* `VersionedGuiltTrip#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` and `Model#redoGuiltTrip()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGuiltTrip` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th entry in the finance tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `guiltTripStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add typ/Expense...` to add a new expense. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `guiltTripStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGuiltTrip()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `guiltTripStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGuiltTrip()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`, `Model#undoGuiltTrip()` or `Model#redoGuiltTrip()`. Thus, the `guiltTripStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGuiltTrip()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `guiltTripStateList`, all finance tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add typ/Expense ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedGuiltTrip`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
