    "description": "This module explores the ethical dimension of global affairs. It takes as its point of departure the conviction that global affairs, like all realms of human conduct, is intelligible in questions of obligation, right, good, and so forth. The module interrogates prominent ethical languages that pertain to sovereignty, war, international law, human rights, and moral scepticism. It then considers how these languages arise and conflict in a range of contemporary global issues. Particular emphasis is placed on excavating the ground on which ethic choices are made, defended, and judged.",
