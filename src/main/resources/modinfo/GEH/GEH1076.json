    "description": "Football is found in one form or another in almost every part of the modern world. 'Worlds of Football' takes the ubiquity and diversity of football as an entry point for critical examination of issues of geography and human culture at a range of scales \u2013 from the most intensely local and embodied, to globe-spanning networks. The module uses football as a window into: contextual and environmental variegation in human practices; worldly cultural politics (along lines of age, (dis)ability, class, gender, and race, among others); and processes through which everyday lifeworlds are bound up with distant and not-so-distant people and places.",
