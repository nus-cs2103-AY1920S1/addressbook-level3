== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing AddressBook3 - a CLI (Command Line Interface) application into a better product.
We decided to morph the application into the Njoy Teaching Assistant, to improve the quality of life for teachers by simplifying mundane administrative tasks.
In particular, the application enables teachers to maintain student records to manage students better;
set questions and quizzes to enhance students learning; and keep track of
their schedules with an interactive timetable. +
This is what our project looks like:

.The graphical user interface for Njoy.

My role was to design and write code for teachers to better plan and manage events in their schedule.
The rest of the sections will cover the summary of my contributions to the codebase, the user guide and the developer guide.

=== Summary of contributions

This section summarizes my specific enhancements, code contributions and other helpful increments towards the Njoy Teaching Assistant.

I implemented the commands related to the event feature, which include:

==== Event Creation and Deletion

* *What it does:* Users can create and delete events to keep track of their schedule. These events are created by specifying
the event name, start and end date time. These events also can be set to recur weekly or daily, reducing the hassle
for creating repeated events. Events can also have their own colors to allow users to easily identify and categorize their events.
Users can also delete any events which they have mistakenly created, using the delete event command.

* *Justification:* Teachers usually have numerous activities and events to attend. These include delivering lectures,
meeting with parents, consultations, etc. I wanted to create a feature which allows teachers to easily manage their time,
not just during the office hours, but also to schedule errands and other preparation work.

* *Highlights:* Challenging portions of this feature include:
ensuring there were no duplicate events created as well as implementing the recurring events feature.

==== Event Editing

* *What it does:* Users can edit events that are currently in their calendar.

* *Justification:* There is a possibility that events have to be rescheduled in the calendar, and this functionality allows
teachers to do exactly that. In fact, teachers are allowed to edit any of the fields in an event including its color and
recurrence type.

==== Event Viewing

* *What it does:* Users can view their events in calendar form and set the target date of interest as well as the viewing mode
of the calendar (weekly or daily).

* *Justification:* Teachers may want to view the calendar in different forms, for different purposes. They might want
to have a over-arching view of the upcoming events of the week, thus they may wish to view their events in a weekly form.
They may also wish to go into the details of a specific day when making appointments with students and other teachers.

* *Highlights:* This feature remembers the
preferences of the user in the same instance of the application. For example, after switching to the student list and
switching back to the calendar, it remembers the target date of interest as well as the viewing mode (weekly or daily),
and renders it accordingly.

==== Event Screenshot

* *What it does:* Users can take a screenshot of the calendar and save it to a png file.

* *Justification:* Teachers may want to share their weekly schedule or simply have a image of their events to be viewed on
their mobile devices. This feature allows them to do exactly that by taking a screenshot of whichever date and time the user is
currently viewing and saving it into a png file.

* *Highlights:* The implementation of this feature
was rather challenging, as different users have different screen sizes, and taking a screenshot may not capture all the
information desired by the user. As such, the screenshot feature, actually opens the calendar into full-screen mode before
taking the screenshot. This is a "best-effort" approach to capture as much detail as possible within the confines of the user's display.

==== Event Export

* *What it does:* Users can export all their events into a ics file.

* *Justification:* Teachers may want manage their events simultaneously in other calendar applications such as Google Calendar.
Note that most calendar applications accept ics file types as imports.

* *Highlights:* The implementation of this feature was rather challenging, as every event had to be converted into a ics-compliant format, which
represents all its information including the recurrence type.

=== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users.
The following are specific portions of the NJoy Assistant's User Guide that I have selected. I'll only show one example
of creation, editing and display for the features that I have created, as they are repetitive._

=== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical
documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.
Again, I'm only going to include the most relevant portions of the guide, especially the UML diagrams that I
have created. Also, some of the command hyperlinks will obviously not work because I have omitted them for brevity._
