    "description": "The purpose of this course is to help public management students hone and entrench the skills necessary to cultivate and implement good ideas and effective sustainable performance in public organizations. To do so, the course has been designed in a very unique manner. Firstly, prior to each class, students are asked to complete self-diagnostic exercises which help them to evaluate their current level of proficiency in the skill to be studied. Secondly, a comparably high number of case study discussions and group exercises will be undertaken in class. Accordingly, students need to come to class with their defences lowered.",
