    "description": "Human rights adjudication has expanded in many jurisdictions across the world in the past few decades. Yet there is still scepticism about the role of courts in human rights adjudication. This subject will provide students with the opportunity to reflect critically on the role of courts in human rights adjudication by introducing them to the different approaches to the adjudication of human rights in a range of jurisdictions including South Africa, Canada, Germany, the US, Israel, Australia, India, Singapore and the EU. Several key human rights issues that have arisen in different jurisdictions will be analysed and compared.",
