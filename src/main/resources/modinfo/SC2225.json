    "description": "Art and anthropology have had a long, if at times,\ncontentious history of exchanges, from selective\nappropriations to inventive collaborations. This\nmodule explores the vibrant relationship between art\nand anthropology to think about what each still can\nlearn from the other. We start with a historical\nexamination of the exchanges between two disciplines\nover the 20th century, from the use of ethnographic\ntropes by artists to avant-garde influences on\nanthropological practices of representation. We then\nturn to the deeper affinities with between the two as\nfound in the ethnographic turn in art,\nart/anthropology collaborations, and, more recently,\nthe social/participatory/relational turn.",
