    "description": "A capstone research project in this major can take different forms, depending on the student\u2019s area of focus. This module supports the implementation of the capstone project through the development of self-regulated research excellence. Arts and Humanities students will pursue their research, construct creative works, and consider methodological issues together to critique and improve each other's written work in a seminar setting. Over the 13 weeks, students will fine-tune research skills as well as oral and written communication skills collaboratively. Experts from The Writers\u2019 Centre, the Library, Arts Spaces and CIPE will also enhance the module.",
