    "description": "key theme in the course is that an understanding of doing business in any specific country involves consideration of two separate levels of analysis: the country perspective and the firm perspective. While these two levels of analysis significantly influence one another, it is important to consider them separately and acknowledge how they differ from one another. Second is to introduce the diversity of business environments in Asia\u2014the range is as diverse as exists worldwide. There is no single Asian business environment, but instead many different environments, each of which has different implications for business strategy. In canvassing global firm strategy, it is expected that students will learn a basic set of descriptive facts about various countries and top businesses in the region. Frameworks that fit one context may be useless for another. In this course, the emphasis is not on filling in frameworks and applying standard recipes. On the contrary, students will be expected to challenge recipes, question received wisdom, and exhibit unconventional thinking \u2013 all traits required to conduct effective global strategy worldwide.",
