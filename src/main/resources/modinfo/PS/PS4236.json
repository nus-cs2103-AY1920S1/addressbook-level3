    "description": "In this module, we will discover how environmental problems have exceeded their boundary as an 'issue area' and have altered contemporary political theorizing. This includes questions related to the roles of the state, the borders of the moral community, and matters of justice. We will trace the transformation of liberal, republican, conservative, socialist, and feminist political thought in the wake of environmental politics. Finally, we will ask whether there is such a thing as a distinctly 'green' political theory.",
