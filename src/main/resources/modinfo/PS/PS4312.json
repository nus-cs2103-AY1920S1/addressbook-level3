    "description": "This module introduces significant questions of politics in Europe. It teaches students to analyse the ideas, institutions, actors, and interests that influence European politics. We explore the domestic politics of European states including Germany, France, and the U.K., and relations among European states after World War II, with particular attention to European integration. While most of our focus will be devoted to Western Europe, we will discuss political transitions in Eastern Europe and the process of EU expansion. We will critically assess debates in European politics on issues like migration and refugees, Brexit, the European economy, foreign and security policy.",
