    "description": "With emphasis on fundamentals, this module develops analysis methods that are used to understand the operation and design of solid-state microwave electronic circuits commonly used in microwave systems. Methods for simulating nonlinear microwave circuits and processing of circuit parameters will be discussed. Major topics include: Linear circuit parameter conversion. Analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits. Lossy match, lossy feedback, distributed and power amplifiers. Oscillator theory; diode and transistor oscillators. Frequency multiplication, division and synthesis. Microwave frequency conversion, mixer analysis, single-ended and balanced mixers, diode and transistor mixers, image rejection, mixer noise.",
