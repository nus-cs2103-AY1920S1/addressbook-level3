    "description": "Generic medicines are becoming increasingly important as a means of providing access to affordable healthcare by helping to suppress rising healthcare costs. This module aims to equip students with skills to assess the therapeutic equivalence of a generic medicinal product relative to a comparator, specifically with respect to bioavailability (BA) and bioequivalence (BE). Students will learn how to design and conduct appropriate bioavailability and bioequivalence studies in accordance with established international guidance documents, and to analyse the data from such studies.",
