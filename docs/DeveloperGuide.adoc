== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

//tag::logicClassDiagram[]
For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `iFridgeParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `tlist add n/Tomato Soup` Command
image::AddTemplateListSequenceDiagram.png[]

* args1: tlist add n/Tomato Soup
* args2: add n/Tomato Soup
* args3: n/Tomato Soup

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddTemplateListCommandParser`, `TemplateListParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

//tag::reminderdefaultfeature[]
=== Reminder Default Feature

==== Implementation

Color coding for grocery list is based on the default number of days set in the iFridge settings in the user prefs.
Changing the default reminder number of days will update the color coding in the grocery list accordingly. It will also
be saved when the app is closed and used again when the app is relaunched.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remDefault r/3")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remDefault r/3` Command
image::RemDefault.png[]

//end::reminderdefaultfeature[]

//tag::generalundoredofeature[]
=== General Undo/Redo Feature

==== Implementation

There are 3 types of undo/redo feature, glist undo/redo for grocery list, slist undo/redo for shopping list,
and tlist undo/redo for template list.

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: How undo/redo is implemented

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create undo/redo separately for different lists.

* Pros: More flexibility for user in choosing which list to undo.
* Cons: Does not support commands which connects between the different lists which has an undo/redo feature of its own
(eg. mergebought command which links shopping list and grocery list cannot be undone, as both shopping list and grocery list
have their own undo/redo feature and complications may occur due to the interdependency between the different lists)

**Alternative 2**: Implement undo/redo universally so undo/redo will undo/redo any type of the last command executed.

* Pros: Supports undoing/redoing commands which connects between different lists as there will be no complications arising
from the interdependency of the list.
* Cons: Less flexibility to choose which list to undo.

//end::generalundoredofeature[]

//tag::groceryundoredofeature[]
=== Grocery Undo/Redo Feature

==== Implementation

Versioned Grocery List extends Grocery List and contains different states of grocery list.
Versioned Waste List extends Waste List and contains different states of waste list.
It supports any kinds of grocery command which modifies the content of the grocery list. Since the delete
grocery command modifies both grocery list and waste list, each grocery command will call
`Model#commitGroceryList` and `Model#commitWasteList` so that undoing/redoing a grocery delete command will update both
grocery list and waste list, while the other commands will only modify the grocery list.

//end::groceryundoredofeature[]

//tag::shoppingundoredofeature[]
=== Shopping Undo/Redo Feature

==== Implementation

Versioned Shopping List extends Shopping List and contains different states of shopping list.
Versioned Bought List extends Grocery List and contains different states of bought list.
It supports any kinds of shopping command which modifies the content of the shopping list except for mergebought command.
Since the bought shopping command modifies both shopping list and bought list, each shopping command excluding mergebought command
will call `Model#commitShoppingList` and `Model#commitBoughtList` so that undoing/redoing a bought shopping command will update both
shopping list and bought list, while the other commands will only modify the shopping list.

//end::shoppingundoredofeature[]

//tag::templateundoredofeature[]
=== Template Undo/Redo Feature

==== Implementation

Versioned Template List extends Template List and contains different states of template list, previous templates, new templates, and index list.
It supports template list command undo/redo, and template item command undo/redo. Each template command will call `Model#commitTemplateList`
which updates the corresponding lists in the versioned template list.

.The following activity diagram shows what happens when the user enters an undo template command
image::UndoTemplateActivityDiagram.png[]

When a template list command is undone/redone, the user interface will update the template list panel and clear the template item panel.
When a template item command is undone/redone, the user interface will update the template item panel with the corresponding updated template
from the prevTemplate/newTemplate list respectively.
The index list is used to determine whether a template list command or a template item command is being undone/redone.
If the current index is -1, the current state pointer is pointing to a template list command, else, it is pointing to a template item command.

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: How template undo/redo is implemented

**Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Template undo/redo feature covers both template list command and template item command

* Pros: Prevents issues surfacing from interdependency between template list and template item command
* Cons: Less flexibility for users in choosing to undo/redo which list

**Alternative 2**: Create undo/redo separately for template list command and template item command

* Pros: More flexibility as users can choose which list to undo/redo
* Cons: Harder to implement as we need to check for interdependency between the two list and how it affects the other list' state
before performing the corresponding undo/redo

//end::templateundoredofeature[]

//tag::reportwastefeature[]
=== Waste Report Feature

==== Implementation

Under `WasteReportCommand#execute`, when iterating through the months from the starting month to
the ending month:

* We first retrieve the relevant `WasteList` for the month using `Model#getWasteListByMonth(WasteMonth)`
* Thereafter, we obtain a `WasteStatistic` object, which contains the weight, volume and quantity of food wasted
for the given month by calling `WasteList#getWasteStatistic`.
* Collect the data by storing it in a `HashMap` indexed by the month (a `WasteMonth` object) with the corresponding
`WasteStatistic` as the value.

The following sequence diagram shows how the waste report feature works:

image::WasteReportSequenceDiagram.png[]

image::WasteReportSequenceDiagramRef.png[]

The following activity diagram shows what happens when the user enters a command to generate a waste report:

image::WasteReportActivityDiagram.png[]

To see what constitutes a valid time frame, refer to our
https://ay1920s1-cs2103-f10-2.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#displaying-food-wastage-statistics-code-wlist-report-code[user guide].

==== Possible Alternative Implementations
* **Alternative 1**
Since the waste statistics for the previous months are unlikely to change, they can be stored externally and loaded
upon launch of the application, instead of calculating every time the waste report command is executed.
** Pros: Will improve the runtime of the application.
** Cons: Will take up more storage space.

//end::reportwastefeature[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


//tag::usegroceryfeature[]
=== Use Grocery Feature

==== Implementations
The user is able to use specific item that she has. This can be done with the `glist use` command. +

The sequence diagrams for interactions between the Logic and Model components when a user executes the `glist use` command is shown below.

image::UseGrocerySequenceDiagram.png[]

The current implementation for using a grocery item is by overwriting the existing grocery item with a new grocery item object with its amount field deducted. The rest of the fields are copied over without any other modifications.

The `glist use` command is also able to support unit conversion.

The following activity diagram summarises how the unit conversion is done.

image::UseGroceryActivityDiagram.png[]

The conversions of units are done by `Amount` class. Unit type is necessary in the implementation to allow for keeping track of different unit groups. For example, `kg`, `g`, `lbs`, and `oz` are all categorised under the unit type `Weight`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Reducing the amount

.Design considerations of the `glist use` command
[cols="50,50"]
|===
|Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation) |Alternative 2

a|Create a new grocery item and replace it with the old one.

* Pros:
** Easy to implement.
** Less bug-prone.

* Cons:
** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

a|Modify the Amount in the grocery item.

* Pros:
** Will be more efficient and use less memory.

* Cons:
** Amount would be modifiable (not `final` anymore), thus is vulnerable to alterations.
|===

===== Aspect: Keeping track of unit type

.Design considerations for the unit conversion in `glist use`
[cols="50,50"]
|===
|Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation) |Alternative 2

a|Keeping the original unit of the item.

* Pros:
** Easy to maintain.

* Cons:
** Not very intuitive.

a|Changing the original unit of item to the one input by user.

* Pros:
** Will be more intuitive to the user. e.g. After using `900ml` of a `1L` milk, it is more intuitive to show `100ml` instead of `0.1L`.

* Cons:
** Difficult to implement and maintain, due to its subjectiveness.
** Consistency may be compromised.
|===

//end::usegroceryfeature[]

=== WasteList Feature
//tag::addTemplateListfeature[]

=== Add Template Feature
The add template mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueTemplateItems`, `TemplateList`.

The `TemplateList` is an observable list of `UniqueTemplateItems` while the UniqueTemplateItems contains an observable list
of template items.

To add a template into the `TemplateList`, a new `UniqueTemplateItems` object is created with the entered name.
The model is updated with the new `TemplateList`, the `TemplateToBeShown`, which is an instance of the object `UniqueTemplateItems` containing
the details of the template being edited or viewed will not be updated. Only a `TemplateItemCommand` will involve an update of the `TemplateToBeShown`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command related to managing of template items:
image::TemplateListCommandUIActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: Due to multiple lists in the iFridge app, the template list will only be usable to the user when executing a TemplateList or
a TemplateItem Command. For example, an AddTemplateListCommand or a AddTemplateItemCommand.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new template list command related to the managing of templates and illustrates
some differences in the UI as compared to when a template item command is executed:

image::TemplateListCommandUIActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit template item operation works for the logic component:

image::AddTemplateListSequenceDiagram.png[]

Due to lack of space, please refer to the below list for args1, args2, args3 shown in the diagram above.

* args1: "tlist add n/Tomato Soup"
* args2: "add n/Tomato Soup"
* args3: "n/Tomato Soup"

NOTE: The lifeline for `TemplateListParser`, `AddTemplateListCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: How add command is parsed

The following class diagram shows the relationship between the TemplateListParser and the TemplateItemParser for the logic component:

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a separate parser for template list management and template item management
    ** Pros: Easy to implement. Parser structure follows the same structure as the model. More OOP.
    ** Cons: May be confusing to differentiate between TemplateItemParser and TemplateListParser.
* Alternative 2: The TemplateListParser is able to distinguish between template and template item management and call the respective XYZCommandParsers
    ** Pros: Less confusing as there is only one parser toggling between the different command parsers to managing the template list.
    ** Cons: Implementation of the parser becomes less OOP.
* Alternative 3: The TemplateItemParser is at the same hierarchy as the TemplateListParser instead of inside.
    ** Pros: The user command can be shorter. E.g. "template edit ..." instead of "tlist template edit ..."
    ** Cons: Not as obvious to the user that both commands involve the same template list.
