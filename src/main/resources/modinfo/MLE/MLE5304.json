    "description": "The objective is to expose students to different techniques of scanning and transmission electron microscopy including imaging, analysis and diffraction techniques. Major topics will include conventional diffraction contrast imaging of crystals and defects, scanning transmission electron microscopy (high angle annular dark field and annular bright field imaging, electron energy loss spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, nanodiffraction), including the benefits of aberration correction. Specialized and new imaging modes will also be included: imaging of electric, magnetic and strain fields, and in-situ TEM techniques for dynamic experiments, Experimental limitations due to the sample, the microscope design, or physics itself will be discussed.",
