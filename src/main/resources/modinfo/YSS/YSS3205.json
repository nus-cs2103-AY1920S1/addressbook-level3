    "description": "In this course, we will study the theoretical and empirical foundations and policies of international trade at a fairly abstract and rigorous level. The course materials and lectures will employ mathematics. The issues that will be addressed include the causes of international trade, the gains from trade, the role of international capital movements, the effects of trade and investment barriers, etc. We will also read about real\u2010world areas of trade, such as trade institutions, the interactions between trade and development issues, etc. We will study models in trade and apply them to questions of interest in the real world.",
