This portfolio page serves to document my contributions during the development of SecureIT, a desktop application to enhance data security.

== About the project

I, together with 4 other software engineering students, was tasked to enhance an existing command-line-based desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We decided to morph it into a confidential information management system called *SecureIT*. It enables employees to safely keep their confidential data, including passwords, files, cards, and notes, at their workplaces.

My role was to design and implement general data encryption and the file management feature. This is what the file management mode looks like:

== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to encrypt data with a master password and to manage encrypted files

* What it does: The master password converts the app's data into an encrypted format which is not readable by others. The app can also encrypt external files and manage them.
* Justification: The data of small-to-medium enterprises are often stored as files and are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, a mechanism has to be in place to protect the data.
* Highlights: The encryption works seamlessly with existing and future commands. The file manager allows users to preview encrypted files without decrypting them in the file system. It can be expanded in future to allow edit of encrypted files.
* Credits: The encryption relies on Java's build-in `*Cipher*` class without the need to implement encryption algorithms. Preview of PDF and Word documents relies on third-party libraries, Apache PDFBox and Apache POI, respectively.

== Contributions to the User Guide

The following excerpt from our User Guide shows the usage of the file manager. Please note that not all commands are shown. Refer to the https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f11-3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#file[User Guide] for a complete list.

=== File Manager

SecureIT has a file manager which helps you keep confidential files that you do not wish others to see. Using your master password, SecureIT converts your files into an encrypted format which cannot be read by other applications.

To access the file manager, simply type `goto file` in the command box and press Enter.

==== Encrypting a file : `encrypt`

You can encrypt a local file using its file path. You may also tag the file at the same time for easy reference later on.

Format: `encrypt FILEPATH [t/TAG]...`

Example: +
Let's say that you have been tasked to keep your company's reports. With every detail about the company's operation, the reports are highly confidential and you wish to prevent information leaks. Here is how you can protect your data!

. Type `encrypt` in the command box, followed by a space. Do not press Enter yet.
+

. Drag and drop the file that you wish to encrypt into the command box.
+
image::niqiukun-ppp/DragAndDrop.png[]

. The file path should appear in the command box. Press Enter to execute the command.
+
image::niqiukun-ppp/EncryptFilePath.png[]

. The result box displays the message "File encrypted: ..." You can see that the information of the encrypted file appears in the list.
+
image::niqiukun-ppp/FileEncrypted.png[]

. Encrypted files have the prefix `[LOCKED]` in their file names. You can verify that the file has been encrypted.

*Tip*

* The app does not support encryption of files larger than 2GB.
* If you are using Windows, please close the file before encryption.

*Warning*

* The app may freeze for some time if the file to be encrypted is large. Please do not force exit the app during encryption.
* The `encrypt` command keeps your information secret but others/malware may still change or delete your file. If you wish to prevent malicious alteration or deletion, please set up additional access rights in your file system.
====

==== Decrypting a file : `decrypt`

You can decrypt a local file using its displayed index number.

Format: `decrypt INDEX`

Example: +
Let's say that your colleague requests a copy of one of the reports kept by you. Before sending them the report, you need to decrypt it first. Here is how you can do it.

. Type `decrypt` in the command box, followed by a space and the index number of the file that you wish to decrypt. Press Enter.
+
image::niqiukun-ppp/DecryptFour.png[]

. The result box displays the message "File decrypted..." and the file record is gone from the list.

*Tip*

* If you notice that the file decryption fails, it may be because you have renamed or moved the file without using SecureIT (for example, in your operating system).
* In that case, use `remove` command to remove the file from the list first, and then use `add` command to add the renamed/moved file. Please refer to the https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f11-3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#removing-a-file-code-remove-code[`remove`] and https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f11-3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#adding-an-encrypted-file-code-add-code[`add`] commands for detailed instructions.
