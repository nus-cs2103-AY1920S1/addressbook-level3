    "description": "With the globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry, MRCTs are an increasing trend in pharmaceutical development. While this approach may make the conduct of trials more efficient through multiple recruitment centres, issues of adequate population representation, ethnicity differences and statistical robustness are frequently brought up. This 4-credit module provides the principles supporting MRCTs and address some of the concerns related to this approach, building on the fundamentals of good clinical practices, study designs (selection of population and doses) and regulatory evaluation sciences (biostatistics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacovigilance).",
