    "description": "The purpose of the Capstone Project is for the students to engage in research and apply multi-disciplinary knowledge they have acquired from their MSc program, to a real-world problem focused on clinical health issues. During the project, students utilise the entire process of solving a realworld team-based project, from collecting to processing the actual data, to applying suitable analytic methods to the problem. Students will work in small teams on a project supervised by a mentor from various departments of NUH and NUS. The final project will be delivered in a written report and a formal presentation.",
