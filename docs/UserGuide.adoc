== Introduction

KeyboardFlashCards (KFC) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to study using flashcards.
More importantly, it is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, KFC
can help you manage your flashcards much more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? You should be! KFC is perfect for NUS Computing students. We even have additional
features not available with most flashcard managers that we're sure you'll love. Enjoy!

Please also note the following icons, which will indicate points of interest throughout this document.

NOTE: A point of information that you may wish to note

TIP: A tip or suggestion

CAUTION: A cautionary word of advice

== Quick start

//tag::features[]

== Features
This section contains the features and their respective commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add >QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter. The command format would thus be as such: `add q>1+1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `q>QUESTION [c>CATEGORY]` can be used as `q>1+1 c>math` or as `q>1+1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be inserted zero or more times e.g. `[c>CATEGORY]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `c>math`, `c>math c>school` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q>QUESTION a>ANSWER`, `a>ANSWER q>QUESTION` is also acceptable.
* Currently, our application does not support emoji.

list on the right-side pane. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Key the above mentioned example into the command box.

image::BadFlashcard.png[width="550"]

The command will add the 2nd `FlashCard` on the list, "How to declare a pointer in C?" as a "Bad" `FlashCard`.
After which, the result box will show the success message.
A new `Deadline` will now be shown at the right side-bar, 3 days later from the day it was entered.

image::BadFlashcardAdded.png[width="550"]

NOTE: "Bad" rated `FlashCard`(s) will be added to as a `Deadline` which is due 3 days later. This is an approximated value that based on
the theory of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Spaced Repetition], referring to Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve
by Hermann Ebbinghaus who hypothesised this theory in 1985.

=== List all "Bad" FlashCards for a specific date `listbad d>DATE`

List all the "Bad" rated `FlashCard`(s) from a specific date. The `FlashCard` questions will be shown.

`listbad d>14/11/2019`

You can remove a specific "Bad" rated `FlashCard` from the list

`removebad d>14/11/2019 i>2`

You can refer to the example above.

As seen from before, after listing all the "Bad" rated `FlashCard`(s) for a specific date using `listbad d>14/11/2019`,
you can observe the full list as seen below.

image::listbad.png[width="600"]

Afterwards, you can choose to remove as specific "Bad" rated `FlashCard` from that list.
Using the example `removebad d>14/11/2019 i>2`, you can observe this.

image::removebad.png[width="600"]

Once removed, a success message will be shown!

image::removebadsuccess.png[width="600"]

NOTE: Using the `remove` command to remove a "ToDo: Bad Questions" `Deadline` does not remove all the "Bad" `FlashCard`
stored for that date.

=== Test mode: `start`



==== Start command: `start [CATEGORY]`
This command starts the `FlashCard` test mode. If no parameter is supplied, the application will test all
available `FlashCards`.

image::StartEmptyParam.png[width="600"]

If tag(s) are entered, this command starts the `FlashCard` test from any specific category. Only relevant `FlashCards` from the tag(s) will
be tested.

image::StartWithTagParam.png[width="600"]

After starting the test, you should see the first question.

image::StartResults.png[width="600"]

==== See FlashCard answer: `ans`
This command allows you to check the answer of the `FlashCard` question.

image::ShowAnswerCommand.png[width="600"]

After entering the `ans` command, you will see the answer to that `FlashCard`.

image::ShowAnswerResults.png[width="600"]

==== Rate FlashCard: `rate RATING`
After seeing the answer, you can enter this command which rates the `FlashCard`,
depending on how well you answered the question i.e. `easy`, `good`, `hard`.

image::RateCommand.png[width="600"]

At the same time, the next question will be displayed if available.

image::RateResults.png[width="600"]

==== Skip question: `skip`
If you would like to manually filter and skip questions, the `skip` command helps you to skip `FlashCards`,
saving you extra time.

image::SkipCommand.png[width="600"]

Similarly to the `rate` command, `skip` command fetches the next question if available.

image::SkipResults.png[width="600"]


==== End test: `end`
You can stop the test any time simply by typing `end`.

image::EndCommand.png[width="600"]

By exiting the test mode, normal commands such as `listall` and `add` are re-enabled.

=== Export FlashCards to a file: `export c>CATEGORY p>FILE_PATH`

You can use this command to export all your `FlashCards` in a particular category, to an external file.
This may be useful if you wish to publish your `FlashCards` somewhere, print them out, or share them with a friend.
The file will be located at the file path that you specify, and the format of the file will be inferred from the
extension. We currently support exporting to JSON ('.json') and document ('.docx') file formats. +
Example: `export c>CS2105 p>C:\Documents\cs2105.json`

Suppose you have a category named `CS2105`, and you wanted to export the `FlashCards` in that category to an external file
(so you can share them with your friend). Here's how you would go about this:

. Type the example command given above into the command box (`export c>CS2105 p>C:\Documents\cs2105.json`), as shown below.
+
image::ExportDemo1.png[width="600"]

. Press **Enter** to execute the command. The results box will display a success message similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.
+
image::ExportDemo2.png[width="600"]

. Using your file explorer, navigate to the directory that you specified in the command (in this case, it would be `C:\Documents`). Sure enough, your exported file is there!
+
image::ExportDemo3.png[width="600"]

Please refer to the table below for a summary of the file formats that we support exporting to:

|====
|**Format**|Document ('.docx')|JSON ('.json')
|**Intended purpose**|For use as a cheat sheet|For sharing
|**What is copied from each `FlashCard`**|Question and answer only|Question, answer, and the category which you specified in the export command
|====

NOTE: If you're on a Unix-based operating system (e.g. Mac OS, Linux), any absolute paths that you specify will have to begin from the root directory `/`, not the user directory `~`. For example, if you were on a Mac and your username was "jason", and you wanted to export to a document file on your desktop, the file path would be `/Users/jason/Desktop/document.docx`.

CAUTION: Your file paths must be comprised solely of alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following characters: `~\/-_!:[]()` +
It must also end in one of the supported file extensions - either `.json` or `.docx`. +
{blank} +
Do note that some directories may be protected by your operating system (`C:\` on Windows, `/` on Unix). You may not be allowed to save files to these directories. +
{blank} +
Please take care not to modify exported JSON files - your friends might have trouble importing them otherwise.


// end::flashcardexport[]

// tag::flashcardimport[]



=== Import FlashCards from a JSON file: `import p>FILE_PATH`

You can use this command to import `FlashCards` from a file that you or someone else had exported to earlier.
We currently only support importing from JSON ('.json') files. +
Example: `import p>C:\Downloads\cs2105.json`

Suppose that your friend has kindly exported some of his `FlashCards` for you to use. You have download the JSON file that he sent you,
and it's currently located at the following path: `C:\Downloads\cs2105.json`.
Your next step is to get those `FlashCards` into your copy of KFC. Here's how you'd go about this:

. Type the example command given above into the command box (`import p>C:\Downloads\cs2105.json`), as shown below.
+
image::ImportDemo1.png[width="600"]

. Press **Enter** to execute the command. The results box will display a success message similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.
Furthermore, the category list on the left will now display the category of the newly-imported `FlashCards`!
+
image::ImportDemo2.png[width="600"]

NOTE: Duplicate `FlashCards` will not be imported. _KFC_ will notify you if it detects duplicate `FlashCards` in the provided file.

// end::flashcardimport[]



=== Get the full list of commands: `help`

This command allows you to view all the commands available in the application. +

+
image::StatsWindow1.png[width="400", height="400"]
+

Starting from the top, the first chart displays the total number of `FlashCards` rated as good, hard and easy. The second chart displays the total number of `FlashCards` rated as good, hard and easy that are completed during test mode. The last chart displays your performance (in percentage) for all tests completed. Performance is determined by the ratio of `FlashCards` rated as good and easy to `FlashCards` rated as hard.
+
Note that the second and third chart will be empty if the `stats` command is executed before running at least one test, since both of these charts are dependent on the test mode. Furthermore, the statistics displayed on these two charts will reset when the application is closed.


//tag::theme[]

== FAQ

*Q*: How will the program know the correct answer to the questions? +
*A*: You have to key in the answer manually when you create the question - it’s similar to a real set of FlashCards.

*Q*: How does the reminder system work? +
*A*: You select a category and a date, and the program will remind you to revise that category when the date comes.

*Q*: How will the program know if my answer is good or bad? +
*A*: It doesn’t know - you have to decide for yourself whether you are satisfied with your answer.

*Q*: Will I be able to resume the test from where I left off after I have stopped? +
*A*: No. The program does not support that.

*Q*: Can I change the category of a FlashCard? +
*A*: Yes, it will be one of the fields you can change when you edit the FlashCard. Do note that after you change the category, you will have to refer to it using its new category and ID.

*Q*: Can I use my mouse to interact with the user interface? +
*A*: Yes, but only to a very small extent, like closing the window. This application is targeted primarily at keyboard users.

*Q*: What if I forget the format of a command’s arguments? +
*A*: Don’t worry! Just try your best. If the format you've provided is wrong, you will be prompted with the correct format.
