    "description": "This course gives an overview of the anthropological study of processes of global environmental change (GEC). Topics include warming, drought, pollution, extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and climate-induced migration. The course asks: 1) What are current trends in GEC, and how do they differ from past patterns? 2) What do past ethnographic studies tell us about human societies\u2019 mechanisms for coping with previous, similar events? 3) What does contemporary ethnographic research demonstrate about humans\u2019 experience of and responses to GEC patterns at the local level? And 4) What do anthropological perspectives demonstrate about responses to GEC that might otherwise be obscured?",
