The rapid expansion of biotechnology and medicine, the explosion of computer technologies, datasets of all kinds, and the impacts of society on the environment all challenge our capacity not only to understand our civilization but to sustain it for future generations. Foundations of Science will provide our students the base understandings to contribute to the leadership needed to provide a sustainable planet for future generations.",
