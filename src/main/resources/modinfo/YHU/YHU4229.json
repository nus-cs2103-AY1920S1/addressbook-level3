    "description": "Knowing makes you a good person, and seeking to know is morally improving. Plato apparently commits himself to these crazy claims. We will investigate why. What is knowledge such that seeking it is good for us? What effect does inquiry have on character? How must we conceive of the good if knowing is not to be merely instrumentally good? Does it matter, morally, which conception of knowledge we have? To address this latter question, we will consider the much different epistemology of the Indian Buddhists, who also consider knowledge to be indispensible to the ultimate good.",
