    "description": "This module is an introduction to social policy in population and health issues, with a special focus on countries in Asia that are experiencing rapid demographic and epidemiological transitions. It examines the relationships between population health and development issues, and the different approaches and methods of social policy utilized to compare present and future health and population-related challenges. Past experiences of population growth, movement and decline and the longer term effects on health and related sectors will also be studied with their policy implications. The course takes a systematic life-cycle approach and is a practice-based and policy-oriented module. The practical applications of public health and population sciences are thus employed to the organization of public programs to meet the needs of specific population agegroups. In practice, existing government departments in Ministries of Health or Ministries of Social Welfare have been organized to deliver social services by age-groups - from birth to death across childhood, youth, adulthood and old age. Similarly, the organization of the class schedule takes on such a structure, and will have participation from invited practitioners from relevant government agencies. Selected regional experiences in population health policies and programs will be analysed in various casestudies. Seminar topics on current topical issues include comparative national population policies, family planning and reproductive health, maternal and child health, adolescent health, adult health, health of the elderly, endof-life issues, population ageing and the future of population health in Asia.",
