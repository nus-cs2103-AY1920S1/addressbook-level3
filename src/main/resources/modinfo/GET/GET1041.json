    "description": "This general education module will explore the world of theme parks, originally inspired by the films and vision of Walt Disney. The course will examine a history of this leisure form, and examine how theme parks and theming offer us an interesting lens to understand the contemporary world. What are the values and ideologies that are inscribed within theme parks? Is there a specific 'culture' associated with Disney? By examining the Disney phenomenon and the world of theme parks, students will be challenged to think critically about aspects of leisure and popular culture that shape our world views.",
