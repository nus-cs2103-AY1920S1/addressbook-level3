    "description": "Singapore\u2019s manufacturing industry sector is an important part of Singapore\u2019s economy contributing almost to about 20% of the Singapore\u2019s GDP and employs almost a fifth of the Singapore\u2019s workforce. It also accounts for almost 60% of the Singapore\u2019s projected 2020 Greenhouse gas emissions. The lack of alternative clean energy sources such as renewables to a large extent being close to the equator, however, there is one fuel to which all the countries including Singapore have access to, a fuel that has everything needed for a sustainable and secure energy sector and that is Energy Efficiency. Energy Efficiency (EE) has been identified as a core strategy to reduce emissions. Demand-side management (DM) of energy represents an important opportunity for Singapore to further reduce the gas emissions while reducing the total energy cost and improving industrial competitiveness.",
