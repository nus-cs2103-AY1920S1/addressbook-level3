    "description": "As the world becomes increasingly globalized, the need to understand the theory and practice of diversity and inclusion becomes an imperative. This module introduces students to fundamental concepts, theories and frameworks related to diversity and inclusion. Students will develop awareness about themselves and how they relate to the world around them (especially as it relates to their prejudices and biases). Students will also be exposed to the issues of diversity and inclusion at the global, national, and organisational level, and learn strategies to manage that diversity",
