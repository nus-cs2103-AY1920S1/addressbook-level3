    "description": "This module will extend beyond planning theory to cover recent developments in planning and development in the global, regional and local contexts. The main aim is to equip students with contextual knowledge of how planning is practiced in contemporary markets, recognising the dynamic nature of the development environment and the socio-political imperatives that drive planning decisions. The topics cover fundamental knowledge on how plans are formulated and translated into development projects, in the context of challenging economic, social and political /institutional environments and focus on professional development using case studies.",
