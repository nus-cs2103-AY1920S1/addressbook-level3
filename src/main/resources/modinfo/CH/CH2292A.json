    "description": "The aim of the course is to introduce students to twentieth-century Chinese history and society through the study of Chinese film. The focus of the course is on the aesthetic response of film to major historical crises and social changes. In this course, history is not presented as a mere backdrop to culture, but the motivating factor that shapes and determines it. Rather than giving a chronological overview, the course examines significant cultural phenomena through the lens of cinema. Target students are those who are interested in Chinese film and culture.",
