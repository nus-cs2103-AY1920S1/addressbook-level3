    "description": "This module introduces students to the development of a large system from conceptualisation to its final implementation. It is structured to contain substantial design and development of hardware and software components. This module is the culminating point of a series of modules integrating the theories which students have already learnt in CS1010, CS2040C, CG2028, CG2271 and CS2113/T. With this capstone project, students would be able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the Computer Engineering curriculum to large scale computer engineering projects.",
