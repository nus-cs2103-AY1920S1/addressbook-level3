=== Overview

StudyBuddyPro is a desktop Command Line Interface (CLI) application intended for Computing School students of National University of Singapore (NUS). It aims to lessen target users' revision time consumption without compromising the quality of studies with a centralized platform.

StudyBuddyPro provides three main features: Flashcard, Notes and Cheatsheet. These features are used to revise using flashcards, take notes and generate cheatsheets respectively. Additionally, StudyBuddyPro is equipped with a Graphic User Interface (GUI).

=== Summary of contributions

The sections below are a summary of my contributions to the project. It highlights my major contributions and states my minor, code and other contributions.

==== Major Enhancement 1: Automated the Generation of Cheatsheets

This enhancement allows users to automatically generate cheatsheets according to the _tags_ that they specify. From this, it improves the product significantly as users can sift out information to be included in a specific cheatsheet. Thus, it reduces the users' time taken in collating cheatsheets.

This enhancement's implementation makes use of the other features in the StudyBuddyPro to create the contents in the cheatsheets. As such, users can make full use of this auto-generation enhancement by using _tagging_ functionality in those features.

==== Major Enhancement 2: Customization of Generated Cheatsheets

This enhancement allows users to remove contents in the generated cheatsheets by specifying its content indexes or tags. From this, it improves the cheatsheets' usability as users can determine which contents to be included or excluded in the cheatsheets.

This enhancement ensures all contents are placed under the _tags_ specified even after users' personalization. Hence, users can be assured that the cheatsheets contain no irrelevant contents.

==== Minor Enhancement 1: Switching between the Features

This enhancement allows users to toggle amongst the features in the StudyBuddyPro. Also, it allows _global_ commands, like `exit` or `filterall` to be used in any features.

==== Minor Enhancement 2: Clearing Specific Features's Data

This enhancement allows users to clear specific feature's data in the StudyBuddyPro. As such, users do not need to clear the entire data if desired.
