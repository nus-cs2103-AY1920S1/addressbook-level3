    "description": "The main objective of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the role of essential vitamins, minerals and trace elements in the human body. Health risks associated with nutrient under-supply as well as over-supply will be discussed in light of underlying molecular mechanisms. This includes in-depth discussions of food source, nutrient absorption for physiological function, effect of dietary and physiological factors on nutrient bioavailability and homeostatic mechanisms. Discussions will be supplemented by critical assessment of clinical measures and available methodologies for assessment of nutritional status and, through this, recommendations for dietary intake.",
