    "description": "Computers in our pockets are transforming the way we live; the information encoded in our DNA promises to transform our futures. New technologies for DNA sequencing will allow you to purchase the decoding of your own genome before you graduate from NUS. While these advances seem new and sudden, the histories of computer science and molecular biology have been intertwined for decades. Students reading FMS1204B will learn how the computer revolution is changing every aspect of how biology is done, and develop skills to incorporate computer-based analysis into their own studies at NUS, regardless of major.",
