== Introduction
This portfolio aims to showcase the work that I have contributed to a team project called THRIFT. This project is an assignment under one of the core
modules called CS2103T Software Engineering, offered by the School of Computing (SoC) at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
I took this module during Year 2 as an undergraduate while pursuing my Bachelor of Computer in Computer Science at NUS.

This project is developed by a team of five highly motivated members: Poh Jia Hao (Team Lead), Lye Jian Wen (Quality Assurance Manager), Ang Chin Guan, Melvin (Software Architect), Oen Qi Han, Kenson (Process Analyst)
and myself (User Experience Developer).

=== About the project
THRIFT is a financial tracker desktop application that is morphed from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address-book3].
With THRIFT, users can keep track of their incomes and expenses and will not be worried about overspending.
It is designed for NUS students who want to save money and prefer typing to other inputs, like a mouse click.

THRIFT provides basic features to add, update, delete, and tag transactions. It also offers additional utility features to
set budget, convert currencies, clone transactions, filter transactions, and last but not least, undo and redo commands.
All these features will be executed using Command-Line Interface (CLI) as it is one of the requirements in this module. Below shows how THRIFT looks like:

=== About this portfolio
The following symbols and text formatting used in this portfolio:

NOTE: This symbol indicates information that you may want to take note of.

WARNING: This symbol indicates information that you need to be cautious of.

[horizontal]
*undo*:: Bold text indicates user input (in Developer Guide and User Guide).

`UndoStack`:: Text with grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that it is a method/variable name (in Developer Guide), a command (in User Guide).

`**THRIFT**`:: Bold text with mark-up indicates a class/package name.

== Summary of contributions
This section summarises my contributions to THRIFT.

* *Main feature*: I implemented the ability to undo and redo the previous command.
** What it does: The undo command will undo the previous command while the redo command will redo the undone command.
** Justification: It offers users the ability to perform undo and redo multiple times in the event
that they are unable to make a decision. For example, users cannot decide how much budget to set for this month.
** Highlights: The implementation is challenging because I need to provide different implementations for each command
and ensure that it works correctly.

* *Minor feature 1*: I added the monthly expense and income in the GUI.
** What it does: It calculates the total expense and income for the filtered month.
** Justification: This saves users time from calculating it manually.

* *Minor feature 2*: I added filter text in the GUI.
** What it does: It indicates the type of filter used currently for the transaction list.
** Justification: If users have forgotten about the filter they set for the transaction list, they can refer to this filter text.
