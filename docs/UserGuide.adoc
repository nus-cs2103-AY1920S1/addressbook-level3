== Introduction
//tag::intro
image::TraveEzyLogo.png[TravEzy Logo,width=600]


Welcome to _TravEzy_! üòä

Firstly, thank you for downloading our application. We greatly appreciate your support and
we *promise* to make travel easy with _TravEzy_.


What is _TravEzy_?

_TravEzy_ is a desktop application with a command line interface (CLI) and is *perfect* for NUS students who love travelling as much as we do. With a CLI, you will be able to type in your commands much faster than similar applications which require you to keep using your mouse. Furthermore, since this is a desktop application, you do not need a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) to start using _TravEzy_.

TravEzy is perfect for:

* Managing your busy calendar and finding the best time to take that much needed holiday!

* Crafting the ideal itinerary for your trip :)

* Tracking your expenses during your trip, so that you have enough money left for the trip home

* Journaling and looking at fond old memories in your diary

* Keeping in contact with your old and new friends with the help of _TravEzy's_ address book



So, is _TravEzy_ for you?

* Are you a busy university student with a passion for travelling?
* Are your summers and winters swamped with internships, projects and CCA activities?
* Do your numerous commitments get in the way of your travel plans?

IF you answered yes to the questions above, then *yes* it is. If not, it still is :)

travel to +++<u>+++Section 2, ‚ÄúQuick Start‚Äù+++</u>+++ to start TravEzy üòä

It's the end of the semester but there are still orientation camps, internships, and family commitments to attend to. However, after a long and tiring semester, the desire to unwind by travelling is just *too strong*. Sounds like you?

Well, _TravEzy_ has got you covered. Simply inform _TravEzy_ of your schedule (your _commitments_, _school breaks_, public _holidays_ and _trips_) and _TravEzy_ will suggest periods of time when you can travel! Excited to find out more? Well... Read on!

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's calendar_ looks like:

image::calendarScreenshots/calendarInterfaceUG.png[Calendar interface,width=800]

{nbsp}

To help you easily differentiate between various types of _events_, _TravEzy_ has categorised the _events_ into four types: _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ and _trip_. Visually, _TravEzy_ also uses different _labels_ for the different types of _events_, as shown in the image above.

WARNING: The _labels_ indicate the *type* of _event_ you have for that particular day. It does not indicate the number of _events_.

== Itinerary

Now that you have booked your flight, it's time to start planning your trip using _TravEzy's_ Itinerary.

In _TravEzy_, we have broken down your events into 6 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date_, _Time_, _Location_,
_Description_ and _Tag_.

For example, here is an Itinerary entry about our trip to Japan

. _Title_ -> Visit Tokyo DisneySea
. _Date_ -> 12122019
. _Time_ -> 1000
. _Location_ -> DisneySea
. _Description_ -> Remember to take pictures with the Disney Mascots!
. _Tag_ -> Priority: Critical

In the Itinerary, you will be able to add, delete, edit, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special
tasks that you can do with your Itinerary. Read on to find out more! üòä

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary looks like:

image::ItineraryInterface.png[width=800]

=== Adding an event: ``add``

Planning to visit DisneySea tomorrow? Add some rides that you plan to take then! üé¢

[TIP]
If you wish to edit the tag field in the event, indicate it with the prefix ``tag/`` and use the _Priority Dropdown Box_
to select the new priority.

*Example:*

    edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/`` in the _command box_.

the _Priority Dropdown Box_.

image::ItineraryEdit1.png[width=600]

Step 3. The _result box_ will display the message "Updated successfully! :D
HAND, TrazEzy~"

//tag::address[]

== Address Book

You are heading to a different country for a trip this holiday and you want to let your friends in other countries know

large number of contacts. Looking for a better contacts management application?

_TravEzy_ is definitely the application you are looking for. _TrazvEzy_ allows you to add your contact information
specifying your contact's country. How does _TravEzy_ do that? Read on to find our more...

=== Interface

*Q:* I‚Äôm having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, _TravEzy_ does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However, this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
*A:* Feel free to send an email to the developer team: mailto:thetravellerdiary@gmail.com[thetravellerdiary@gmail.com] and we will access to your queries within three working days. We also value your feedback and will use it to improve _TravEzy_. Thank you and we looking forward to serving you better!

*Q:* Is it advisable to edit the storage files in _TravEzy_ so that the changes will also be reflected when I start the application? +
*A:* _TravEzy_ gives you a caveat and strongly advise against tempering with the storage files in _TravEzy_ as this could result in falsification of the data.

*Q:* Why are there data which I did not included when I first startup _TravEzy_? +
*A:* Being a new user, _TravEzy_ will provide you with some sample data to experiment first before you start using _TravEzy_ proper. Hope that you will enjoy using _TravEzy_.

*Q:* I'm seemed to be having a bug whereby when given multiple similar prefixes, _TravEzy_ will still accept the input but only takes in the second prefix argument. Is this suppose to work as expected? +
*A:* Yes, _TravEzy_ allows users to implement multiple similar prefixes for some commands so it reduce the trouble to delete the previous prefix argument in order to add in a new one.

*Q:* What are some of the cool features that are available in _TravEzy_ currently? +
*A:* _TravEzy_ currently boast a plethora of features such as calendar, itinerary, address book, travelling diary, financial tracker and achievements page. All these features work in tandem with each other to give you the best and only the best travelling experience. Not only that, the _TravEzy_ team also decided to spice things up and included some easter eggs scattered throughout the
application for users to discuss and discover. Hope that you have fun finding these cool easter egg features! üê∞üê∞üê∞
