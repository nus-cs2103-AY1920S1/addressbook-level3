    "description": "In this module students will write (and rewrite!) two fulllength plays of no less than 60 minutes in length. These\n\nwill be critiqued intensively by their classmates and by the\n\ninstructor. Students are at liberty to pick their own topics\n\nand genres. Specific historical or critical readings and\n\ndramatic texts will be assigned based on individual\n\nstudents interests (e.g. musical theatre, Theatre of the\n\nOppressed). This is a demanding creative writing module\n\nrequiring self-direction and artistic independence.",
