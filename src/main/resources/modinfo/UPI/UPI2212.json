    "description": "In this module, we will study technologies of the self, practices that individuals adopt in order to transform themselves in light of their ideals. We will look at the origins of this concept in the study of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and discuss texts drawn from Western and Eastern traditions that recommend particular practices of self-transformation. Throughout the module, we will also consider whether ancient technologies of the self are still relevant today and to what extent contemporary selfimprovement approaches and forms of digital selffashioning are modern examples of technologies of the self or a qualitatively different phenomenon.",
