    "description": "Today\u2019s most widely-known, international concert repertoire is primarily made up of 18th-, 19th-, and early 20th-century European and North American composers and their music. This module presents a look, listen, and study of their music and legacy focusing on two parallel movements in the European tradition: the classical, rococo, galante, emfindsamer stil, and neo-classical; and sturm und drang, romantic, and neo-romantic. The focus of learning in this course is through primary source materials. (Non-conservatory students that can read music are invited to enrol in this course as free elective.)",
