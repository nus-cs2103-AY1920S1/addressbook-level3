[NOTE]
The statistics feature only supports file type in the ‘Excel’ format. Data files are to end with the _’.xlsx’_ extension.

[NOTE]
The `print` option allows the generation of a _'.png'_ file containing a snapshot of the statistics report generated. Regardless of the print specifications, a new window is opened with the statistics report.

[NOTE]
The statistics report is stored in the same place as where the JAR file is installed. The report can be found under a newly created `printable` directory. If the directory exists beforehand, no new directory is created.

[NOTE]
Filenames without _`.png`_ extension will automatically have the extension appended to the end of the file name.

[NOTE]
If the file name specified already exists in the printable directory, it will overwrite the existing file.

Examples:

* *View Statistics Report (without saving)*: `statistics file/C:\Users\SampleUser\Desktop\6B Prelim Scores.xlsx` +
Shows the statistics report for excel file named _’6B Prelim Scores’_.

* *View and Save Statistics Report*: `statistics file/C:\Users\SampleUser\Desktop\6B Prelim Scores.xlsx print/6B Prelim Performance Report` +
Shows the statistics report for excel file named _’6B Prelim Scores’_. It also saves an image file containing a snapshot of the statistics report in the _’printable’_ directory with name _’6B Prelim Performance Report’_.

*Data File Specifications*

The data file needs to be specified in the following format to ensure that the statistics report is successfully generated. +

[WARNING]
Failure to adhere to the following specifications might result in either the excel file being rejected or erroneous statistics.

* *Entries starts at cell A1 with the cell `Students`, regardless of whether there is score data.*
* *First row begins with the cell `Students`, followed by their names. (e.g. row 1 of 4 cells having `Students`, `Jason`, `Mike` and `Peter`)*
* *First column states the different subjects starting from the second topmost cell. (e.g column 1 of 4 cells having `Students`, `Math`, `Science` and `English`.)*
* *All student names have unique identifiers. (e.g. two students named Jason should be identified as `Jason 1` and `Jason 2`)*
* *All students have a corresponding score for all subjects*
* *All scores are numeric characters (integer or decimals)*
* *There are no gaps between rows and columns.*
* *All cells within the row and column range have at least one non-whitespace characters.*
* *All cells outside the row and column range are empty.*

[WARNING]
Failure to adhere to the following specifications might result in some of the statistical data generated not being useful to the user.

* *All scores should be in percentage terms. (0 ~ 100)*

[NOTE]
The general rule for the file format is to ensure all entries in the file are as compact to the top left as possible; the entries should form a rectangular shape on the top left corner of the excel sheet. The rectangle should have no empty entries while all cells outside the rectangle are empty entries.

The statistics report generated uses weighted average scores across the different subjects to perform analysis. All scores carry equal weight. The statistics generated
allow you to see some of the common descriptive statistics and their relative distributions both in terms of frequency and percentile terms.

The figure below illustrates a sample data set that fulfills all of the above specifications.
