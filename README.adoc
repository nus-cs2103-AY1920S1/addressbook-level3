== Introduction

* Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but canâ€™t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
aspiring to be able to afford their Mala, finally! More importantly, guiltTrip() is a desktop application optimized for
those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, guiltTrip() can get your finance tracker tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Target Users
We are targeting youth and young adults in Singapore aged 20-30 who are interested in keeping track of their finances.
