    "description": "This module will introduce patent law and policy in the United States, and how they relate to other systems of law, primarily U.S. trade secret and antitrust law. The course begins with central legal principles and policies, emphasizing the concepts and skills required of a new lawyer with a working knowledge of patent law. By the end of the course, students will understand the requirements for obtaining protection, the doctrinal elements of an infringement action as well as the various types of defences and remedies available. Students will also gain a practice-oriented perspective of 'real-world' issues facing inventors and companies as well as how those issues are consistent with, or in tension with, other interests.",
