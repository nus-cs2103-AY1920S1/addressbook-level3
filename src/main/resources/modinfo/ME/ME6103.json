    "description": "With the growing need for non-contacting whole-field measurement and inspection, the development and implementation of optical techniques have rapidly become major activities in universities, research institutions and industries. This module aims to provide a good foundation and understanding of these techniques for research and industrial applications. Topics to be covered include: Depth gauging using laser triangulation. Surface contouring using Moire techniques. Displacement measurement and surface contouring using holography. Surface strains and slope measurements using shearography. Surface profiling and deformation measurement using projection grating. Nondestructive testing and surface quality inspection.",
