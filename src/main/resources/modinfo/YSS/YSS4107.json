    "description": "The Law and Liberal Arts DDP Capstone Project is a year-long 10-MC module straddling two semesters. It is a compulsory module that students in the DDP programme must complete in order to graduate. It allows students the opportunity to pursue, in depth, an advanced project of their own choosing while working closely with a supervisor. Students will work on an advanced research project that integrates both the Law and Liberal Arts components of the DDP programme.",
