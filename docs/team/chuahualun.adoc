== PROJECT: DukeCooks

== What is in this document?

This document is a project portfolio documenting the contributions made for DukeCooks by the writer - Hua Lun. +
DukeCooks is the only ever planner you ever need for a healthier lifestyle. +
Here, the Dashboard function's user and developer guide in DukeCooks will be presented.

== Who is behind DukeCooks?

DukeCooks is proudly developed by a group of second-year students from the National University of Singapore. This application was made to fit the team project requirements for a software engineering module. An application, AddressBook 3 (AB3), was assigned as a base for our project. Thus, this is a brownfield project which entails morphing AB3 into a new application which in this case, DukeCooks.

== What exactly is DukeCooks?

DukeCooks is a one-stop healthy lifestyle Desktop application capable of managing your tasks, storing recipes, planning workouts, writing blog and monitoring your health. DukeCooks is made with the mindset of busy individuals. As college students ourselves, we understand the struggles of maintaining a schedule and keeping notes. Not to mention, keeping a balanced and healthy body on top of all the workload.

Current applications in the market can satisfy one out of the many needs we have. This would mean that we would have to download and keep track of a myriad of applications in our system.

Here in DukeCooks, we hope to eliminate; simplify these tedious and stressful chores, all just in one single application. DukeCooks is equipped with a command-line interface (CLI). With this CLI all you have to do is key in what you want to do with an array of predefined commands ranging from adding tasks to writing a new diary entry. Then, all you have to do is sit back, relax and let DukeCooks do all the dirty work!

== My Contributions to DukeCooks

=== Building the Dashboard

The Dashboard in DukeCooks provides an overview of the list of tasks to be done. It is also coupled with a progress bar, mini calendar and pop up messages for encouragement.

Initial works for the Dashboard include referencing the AB3 codebase. The add / delete / edit / list / find functions from AB3 was adapted and available in the Dashboard. As a comparison, the functions listed before was used in AB3 to create and manipulate a person's contact information. In DukeCook’s Dashboard, these functions are used to create and manipulate a task's information.

=== Enhancement 1: Creating the `done` command

The 'done' command was created to complement the Dashboard. The user is able to use the command 'done', to mark a task as complete. Whenever a 'done' command is executed, the progress bar will refresh and update to display the latest information.

=== Enhancement 2: Adding more functionality to the `list` command

The 'list' function adapted from AB3, lists all the items in the list. In the case of a dashboard, this might not be adequate. As such, 2 additional functions were added to the `list` command.

By entering `list taskcomplete` or `list taskincomplete` will display the list of task marked as complete or task that are not complete respectively. With this enhancement, a user is able to look at what task should be taken care of.

=== Enhancement 3: Upgrading the Graphic User Interface (GUI)

Using AB3’s GUI as a backbone, the Dashboard was created. In the GUI for the Dashboard, it displays a progress bar which shows the progress of the tasks completed. A date picker is used to allow users to have quick access to the calendar. Lastly, as a way to motivate users to complete their task, a pop up window with an encouraging message is added. In order to view the message, users will have to check 5 new tasks as done.

=== Enhancement 4: Sorting tasks by date

Based off AB3's add command, the task that is last added will be display at the last of the list. Hence, in order to improve user's experience, a sorting system is built. Now, when a task is added, the task will be displayed based off the date entered in.

=== What makes up a Dashboard?

In DukeCooks, a `Dashboard` object represents an event a user needs to attend to, a task. A `Dashboard` is made up of
a `DashboardName`, `TaskDate` and `TaskStatus`. Below is a class diagram that illustrates how `Dashboard` interacts with other classes.

.Dashboard Class Diagram
[caption="Figure 10: "]
image::DashboardClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

=== In what sense is the Dashboard used as?

==== User stories

1. As an unorganised student, I can sort my task list by date so that I can see which task to prioritise.

2. As an unmotivated student, I can receive motivational messages upon completing tasks.

==== User scenarios

The following is a Use Case diagram for the Dashboard.

.Dashboard Use Case Diagram
[caption="Figure 11: "]
image::DashboardUseCase.png[width="200"]

A use case for marking a task as complete.
....
Software System: DukeCooks
UseCase: UC01 - Mark as complete
Actors: User
MSS:
    1. User completes a task and wants to marked it as complete.
    2. User selects a task according to it's index number to mark as
       complete.
    3. User enters the command `done task` followed by the index
       number in the command box.
    4. DukeCooks finds the inputted index number and corresponding
       task and marks it as complete.
    5. DukeCooks updates the Dashboard to reflect the changes made.
    6. DukeCooks returns a message: Task is marked as complete, for
       the user.

Extensions:
    1a. User is not currently at the Dashboard.
        1a1. User enters `goto dashboard`.
        1a2. DukeCooks displays the Dashboard to the user.
        Use case resumes from step 2.

    3a. DukeCooks detects an error in the entered data.
        3a1. DukeCooks displays an error message.
        3a2. User enters new data.

        Steps 3a1. and 3a2. are repeated until the data entered are correct.
        Use case resumes from step 4.
....

==== Implementation
The functions add/delete/edit/find/list/done task, are found under the Dashboard. +
The Dashboard in `DukeCooks` serves as a homepage which displays a list of tasks set out
by the user. The tasks are sorted accordingly by earliest date; using a custom sorting algorithm.
Here, a task is represented by a Dashboard object.

The operations are as followed:

* `DukeCooks#add_task()` -- Adds and saves the task into `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks#delete_task()` -- Removes the specified task from `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks#edit_task()` -- Edits the specified with a new task name and/or date.
* `DukeCooks#done()` -- Marks a task as complete.
* `DukeCooks#find_task()` -- Finds a list of task with a given keyword.
* `DukeCooks#list_taskincomlete()` -- Lists all the incomplete tasks.
* `DukeCooks#list_taskcomlete()` -- Lists all the completed tasks.
* `DukeCooks#dashboard()` -- Directs user to the dashboard window.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDashboard()`,
`Model#deleteDashboard()`, `Model#setDashboard()`, `Model#hasDashboard()` , `Model#doneDashboard` and
`Model#getDashboardRecords()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete/edit/find/done/dashboard
mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user is currently at a another part of DukeCooks and wants to go to the Dashboard. The
user executes the `dashboard` command. The `dashboard` command calls `Model#getDashboardRecords()`,
which returns the `ReadOnlyDashboard` that returns the `UniqueDashboardList`, iterating over all the task and displaying it on the
homepage.

Step 2. The user executes `add task tn/bake a cake td/12/12/2019` command to add a new
task into DukeCooks. The `add` command calls `Model#addDashboard()`, causing the task to
be added into `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#add()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. After which, the `add` command also calls
`Model#saveDashboard()` to be saved the `dashboard` into the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 3. The user executes `delete task 3` command to delete the 3rd task in the
dashboard. The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteDashboard()` causing the specified task
to be removed from `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#remove()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`,
after the `delete task 3` command executes
to be saved in the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 4. The user executes `edit task...` command to edit a field in a task. The `edit`
command calls `Model#setDashboard()` causing the edited task to be updated in
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#setDashboard()`
which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this stage, the list of task is
sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`, after the `edit task...` command executes to be saved into the `UniqueDashboardList`

Step 5. The user executes `find task...` command to find a list of task given a keyword.
The `find` command calls `Model#hasDashboard()`, which searches through the
`UniqueDashboardList` for tasks containing the particular keyword.

Step 6. The user executes `done 1` command to mark the first task in the list as complete. The `done`
command calls `Model#doneDashboard()`, which will cause the task to be marked as complete in the
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#done()`, which adds
the newly created `Dashboard` object and adds it into the list. After which, `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`
is called to sort the list by date and reflect the newly made changes.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 10) shows how the add operation works:

==== Making Decisions

[cols="10%,50%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Storing a task's status
|A custom class, `TaskStatus`, is created to keep track of the task's status.

- Pros: Additional statuses can be introduced in easily in the future. +
- Cons: Because a `String` is used to create a `TaskStatus`, typos could be made when adding test cases. +

This choice was chosen as it does not limit us to only having tasks marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".
Since choice 1 was used, additional status, "RECENTLY COMPLETED" could be added with ease.

|Use a boolean to check if a task is complete.

- Pros: Easy to implement.
- Cons: Limits expansion since a task can only be marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".

|Sorting tasks by date

|Every time the `add`, `delete`, `edit` task command is called, a `sort` is executed.

- Pros: Easy to implement. Because `sort` is implemented regardless if the list is in-order or not,
there is lesser chance for errors.
- Cons: Because `sort` is executed every time, this might slow down the performance.

This choice was chosen as it reduces the chance of errors and is a safer option.

|Keep an instance of the earliest and latest date. If dates fall out of range from the two dates, sorting does not happen.

- Pros: Faster runtime. +
- Cons: Additional lines of code needed to check if the date falls out of range. Higher chance of making mistakes during implementation.
