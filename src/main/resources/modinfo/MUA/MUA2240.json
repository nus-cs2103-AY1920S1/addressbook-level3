    "description": "As a logical progression from modules MUA1111 and MUA1112, students will continue to study and perform works for piano ensemble - either piano duos or duets. Coaching sessions provide in-depth insight into the specific piece(s) chosen for study; whilst active participation is expected in the studio class, which provides an overview of the most significant works relevant to the genre. Students must participate in a public, assessed performance as the final examination of the prepared work(s); and to reflect upon their learning process in the context of this module by updating their e-portfolios.",
