    "description": "This module studies music produced in and for religious and political environments from the earliest Greek and Chinese civilizations through to the present day. The course explores the origins of music as a symbol of both the church and the state, looking at both in their wider meanings as bodies of people with common beliefs and purposes. It covers religioso and ceremonial music from the ancient civilizations of Greece and China, looks at the Patronage of the European courts and the Catholic and Protestant Churches, and investigates the purpose and value of music in contemporary religious and political ideologies especially those affecting South East Asia. No previous knowledge of music theory or history is required as the module is primarily focused on religious, political and social elements.",
