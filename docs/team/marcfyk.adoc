== About Jarvis

Jarvis was developed by the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu] team.
We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

My team was tasked with contributing to a Command Line
Interface (CLI) desktop address book application for our
Software Engineering project. We decided morph the
application into a productivity tool for students called
Jarvis.

Jarvis enables students to track their calendar, CCAs,
finances and modules. The application will display all
these information in their respective tabs to allow
students to manage all these aspects of their life in
this single application.

This is a layout of how our application looks like:

.Application Page Layout
image::ug/StartUpUI.png[]

In Figure 1, there are three boxes labelled with numbers.
These are the shared GUI sections across all the features:

1. Help Desk -- Unique to each feature's tab, it will
display a list of commands you can use so you do not need
to remember them all!

2. Feature Tabs -- The four main features of Jarvis have
been split into distinct tabs. The tab that you are
currently on would be underlined in red, as seen in
Figure 1.

3. Command Result (top) & Command Entry (bottom) Boxes --
Keying commands into the Command Entry Box will cause the
respective Command Results to show in the Command Result
Box. An invalid command will result in a red border around
the Command Entry Box and an appropriate error message
will be displayed in the Command Result Box.

== My role
My role was to implement the undo and redo feature of
Jarvis and implement storage components to save the
information stored in Jarvis to local storage.

== Undo and redo feature

The following sections covers brief versions from the *Developer Guide*
and *User Guide* explaining the following points:

* Design Considerations (Developer Guide)
* Feature Details (Developer Guide)
* Implementation (Developer Guide)
* Commands (User Guide)
* Use case for `undo`, `redo` and `list-history` (User Guide)



'''

=== Design Considerations
There were several available behavioral design patterns that we were
considering to adopt to implement our undo/redo feature in the application.

* Command Pattern
* Memento Pattern

These patterns are common useful patterns to enable undo/redo functions.
These are also viable options as our application design allows both of these
approaches to be integrated easily.

==== Command Pattern
The application already makes use of the command pattern to decouple the
internal state of the application and the user action.

===== Characteristics
* Space efficient due to storing commands instead of states of the entire
application. Efficient usage of RAM and local storage for the application.
* Commands logic will be more complex as they must know how to undo its
execution. Commands contain more data to retain information needed to undo
its execution.
* Complex inverse executions may be unnecessarily convoluted compared other
approaches (such as the memento pattern). This involves more planning and
support on the classes that commands execute on.
* Requires implementation and testing of each command (and future commands)
to enable undo/redo function with respect to that command. Development of the
application will involve more overhead when integrating new commands to the
application as there are more behaviour to test.
* Development of `HistoryManager` scales along with commands that are added
to the application. Even after `HistoryManager` is developed and integrated
into the application, additional work is required with each command, such as
supporting inverse execution and serializing the command (for local storage).
This can affect development schedule and add time constraints when working
with tight deadlines.

==== Memento Pattern
The application follows a structural facade pattern, storing the data in
ModelManager which implements the Model, which is an interface for commands
to interact with. ModelManager manages classes that wrap their respective data.

===== Characteristics
* Expensive on space due to storing multiple copies of the application
state. This increases the usage of RAM and local storage for the
application.
* Simple robust implementation that can be developed quickly, which can be
useful for tight schedules in the development process.
* Protects the encapsulation of private data of the application state
(provided local storage data is also encrypted). This prevents violation of
encapsulation of classes.
* Development of `HistoryManager` scales with how the information to be
remembered changes. Whenever the nature of the information to be remembered
changes, the memento class `Version` needs to be updated along with how
`VersionedModel` updates and saves its state. Adding new commands also do not
require any changed to `HistoryManager` unless there are changes to the data
fields to be saved in `Model`.

==== Our Thoughts
These are the following questions we asked ourselves when deciding between
these two approaches

* RAM and storage
* Development process
* Software design principles

===== Design Choice

We determined that going along with the command pattern. We want to cater
this application to students whose laptops may not have generous amounts of
RAM. On top of the fact that students typically use their browsers
_extensively_, we felt that we should be mindful of RAM usage.

Comparisons between command pattern and memento pattern with respect to the
development process were trivial since the `Model` and command sets are
already planned, and future changes to `Model` and commands would not have
any serious drawback regardless of the approach.

'''

=== Feature Details

The application should be able to undo and redo changes made by commands to
give the user more flexibility in their inputs. Undo and redo operations
should also be undo or redo multiple commands in a command. In the event that
a undo/redo command that comprises of multiple undo/redo operations fails at
any point, all changes made by the command should be rolled back. This is
reflected in the Activity Diagrams below.

Therefore there is a need to remember commands that change the state of the
`Model`. Commands that just render a view without actually changing the
application should not be stored as it does not make sense to undo or redo
them. We will distinguish these types of commands into two categories,
*invertible commands* and *non-invertible commands*.

* *Invertible commands* -- commands that mutate the state of the `Model` and
should be stored for undo/redo functions.

* *Non-invertible commands* -- commands that do not mutate the state of the
  `Model` and should not be stored for undo/redo functions.

[NOTE]
Undo and redo commands will be considered non-invertible commands even though
they technically change the state of the `Model`. The reason is that they are
commands facilitating the undo and redo operation, thus they should not be
stored.

The following activity diagram illustrates how commands are remembered when a
user types in a command:

.Activity Diagram for how commands are remembered after their successful execution

'''

=== Implementation

The undo/redo feature mechanism is facilitated by `HistoryManager`.
`HistoryManager` remembers *invertible commands*. These commands are stored
internally in two `CommandDeque` objects, `executedCommands` and
`inverselyExecutedCommands`. `CommandDeque` serve as custom `Deque` data
structure, which stores the latest added command to the top.

An undo operation would comprise of taking the latest executed command from
`executedCommands`, inversely executing it, and adding it to
`inverselyExecutedCommands`. A redo operation would comprise of a taking the
latest inversely executed command from `inverselyExecutedCommands`, executing
it, and adding it to `executedCommands`.

`Model` supports operations to facilitate undo and redo capabilities by
extending the `HistoryModel`.

Below is a class diagram between `Model`, `ModelManager`, `HistoryManager`,
`CommandDeque` and `Command`.

.Class Diagram for `Model`, `ModelManager`, `HistoryManager`, `CommandDeque` and `Command`
image::HistoryManagerModelClassDiagram.png[300,300]

Undo and redo operations are executed with `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`
These commands store an integer value referencing the number of commands to
undo or redo, represented by `UndoCommand#numberOfTimes` and
`RedoCommand#numberOfTimes`. The Class Diagram below shows details about
`UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`.

=== Commands

You can see how to undo and redo commands in JARVIS in the following
sections below, which will cover two new commands:

* `undo [NUMBER]`
* `redo [NUMBER]`
* `list-history`

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to undo/redo.
 +
 +
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer that is not larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone/redone (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` parameter is not
supplied, then `[NUMBER]` is taken to be the value *1*.

==== Undo command(s): `undo`
Format: `undo [NUMBER]`

where `[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to `undo`.

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer, no larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone. (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` is not
supplied, then it is taken to be the default value of *1*.

===== Example

* `undo` -- This command will undo the latest command entered by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `undo 1`
* `undo 5` -- This command will undo the 5 latest commands entered by the user,
starting from the latest command.

==== Redo command(s): `redo`
Format: `redo [NUMBER]`

where `[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to `redo`.

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer, no larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone. (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` is not
supplied, then it is taken to be the default value of *1*.

===== Example

`redo` -- This command will redo the latest command undone by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `redo 1`

`redo 5` -- This command will redo the 5 latest commands undone by the user,
starting from the latest command that was undone.

[NOTE]
If you have entered new commands after undoing previous commands, you will not be able to redo the old
commands.

==== List the number of commands you can undo or redo: `list-history`
`Jarvis` can provide you with the maximum number of commands you can `undo` and `redo` - which will be shown
in the Command Result Box.

Format: `list-history`

Lists the number of available commands to be undone, number of available commands to be redone,
and the limit of the maximum number of commands Jarvis can remember for you to support undo and
redo commands.

'''

==== Use case for `undo`, `redo` and `list-history`

Let's say you would like to delete the first task in the `Planner`, highlighted by the
green box in Figure 19 below.

.Before deleting the task highlighted in the green box
image::ug/undo-redo-1.png[400,400]

Deleting the task in Jarvis would then trigger the appropriate command result as seen in the
figure below.

.You have just deleted a task as shown in the command result display
image::ug/undo-redo-2.png[400,400]

As shown in the picture below, entering the command `undo`,  would revert the delete command that
you had entered earlier.

.The deleted task is back in Jarvis
image::ug/undo-redo-3.png[400,400]

You can enter the command `redo`, re-applying the delete command on Jarvis
as shown in the picture below.

.You have just redone that latest undone command
image::ug/undo-redo-4.png[400,400]

You can enter the command `list-history`, displaying the number
of commands that can be undone and redone.

.You can see the number of commands that you can undo and redo
image::ug/list-history.png[400,400]
