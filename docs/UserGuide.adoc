== Introduction

FlashMind helps students to use their time breaks to memorize things
like vocabulary and some general knowledges, especially those who prefer
command line interface (CLI) over clicks. Everything is organized into
flashcards, each contain one question. Users can also tag the flashcards
to group them and see their progress over time through statistics.

****
* QUESTION, DEFINITION and ANSWER must be provided while creating a flashcard, tags and choices are optional.
* If there are no choices specified in the flashcard, the system will generate a short answer flashcard. Otherwise,
  the system will generate an MCQ flashcard.
* Note that during the quiz mode, to answer a short answer flashcard correctly, you must input an answer exactly match
  answer you typed while this flashcard is created. Thus, be sure to provide enough information in QUESTION and DEFINITION
  for you to figure out the exact correct answer.
* Note that while creating an MCQ flashcard, the answer is the input for your correct choice, not just a number.
  If the answer you input does not match any of the choices, the system will tell you this flashcard is invalid.
  Please refer to the following examples for a better understanding.
****

Examples:

* `add q/What is the tallest mountain in the world? d/This mountain is on the boarder of China and Nepal. a/Mount Everest` :
  Creates a new short answer flashcard with the given question, definition and answer.
* `add q/What is the tallest mountain in the world? d/This mountain is on the boarder of China and Nepal. c/Mountain Everest
  c/Mount Blanc c/Shkhara c/Bukit Timah a/Mountain Everest` : Creates a new MCQ flashcard with the given question, definition choices and answer.
* `add q/What is the tallest mountain in the world? d/This mountain is on the boarder of China and Nepal. c/Mountain Everest
  c/Mount Blanc c/Shkhara c/Bukit Timah a/Alps` : Since the answer you input does not match with any of the choices, the
  system will generate an error message.

* INDEX is the index of this target flashcard in the displayed list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Note that while updating choices or tags, they are updated together. This means, assume you have 4 choices for
  flashcard number 2, then you typed `edit 2 c/Mount Blanc`, then there will be only one choice left for flashcard number 2,
  which is Mount Blanc. The same applies when editing tags.
* While editing the answer for an MCQ flashcard, still ensure that the updated answer matches any one of the choices.

// tag::basic3[]

=== Exiting the program

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit` +
Special Notation: We strongly recommend you to exit FlashMind using `exit` command instead of directly closing the window.
The reason is, if you directly close the window, you might lose some of the progress you made in this session. That is, some of the
quiz scores might not be saved. Through `exit` command, all of your quiz results will be saved properly.

=== Saving the data

Flashcards are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually. +
After the data is saved, do not modify any of the Json files manually. You might end up screwing up all the information stored in them.
If unfortunately, you did manually change the Json file and found the FlashMind operating with any problem, the only suggestion we
can give you is to delete the file flashcardlist.json, so the system will start with default flashcard list again.
