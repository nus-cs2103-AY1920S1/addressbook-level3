    "description": "Riding on the NUS Enterprise\u2019s Lean Launchpad program, this module is an elective to provide MBA students opportunities to participate & engage in real-world entrepreneurship, and learn how to commercialize an innovative idea. Since there is no better way to learn than through practice, the students will have to get out of the classroom and talk to potential customers, partners and competitors to experience the uncertainty that comes with commercialising and creating new ventures.",
