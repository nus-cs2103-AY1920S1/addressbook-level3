== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CommandLineParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a loan).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as switching the current panel on display.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `account delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AccountDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Budget Buddy's data.
* exposes multiple unmodifiable `ObservableLists` that can be 'observed' e.g. the `ListPanels` in UI are bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save Budget Buddy's data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `budgetbuddy.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::accounts[]
=== Accounts Feature
==== Implementation

The Accounts Feature allows the users to manage their accounts.
// end::accounts[]

// tag::loans[]
=== Loans Feature
==== Implementation

The Loans feature exists outside of the Account/Transaction mechanisms.
It adds a separate `LoansManager` alongside the main `AccountsManager`, with `Loan` objects stored internally in an `internalList`.

The following class diagram demonstrates the association between the `LoansManager` and `Loan` objects
(miscellaneous methods such as getters and setters are omitted):

image::LoanClassDiagram.png[]

Each `Loan` object has the following attributes:

* `person:Person` -- The person to whom the loan belongs.
* `amount:Amount` -- The amount of money loaned.
* `direction:Direction` -- The direction of the loan (either *in* or *out*).
* `status:Status` -- The status of the loan (either *paid* or *unpaid*).
* `date:Date` -- The date of the loan.
* `description:Description` (optional) -- A description of the loan.

To facilitate the manipulation of `Loan` objects, `LoansManager` implements the following operations.

* `LoansManager#getLoans()` -- Gets the current list of loans.
* `LoansManager#addLoan(Index toAdd)` -- Adds the `Loan toAdd` to `internalList`.
* `LoansManager#editLoan(Index toEdit, Loan editedLoan)` -- Edits the loan at `Index toEdit` to match `Loan editedLoan`.
* `LoansManager#updateLoanStatus(Index toUpdate, Status newStatus)` -- Updates the `Status` of the loan at `Index toUpdate` to `newStatus`.
* `LoansManager#deleteLoan(Index toDelete)` -- Deletes the loan at `Index toDelete` from `internalList`.

After each of the above operations, the state of `internalList` is saved in the file `loans.json`, which is stored on the local hard disk.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `LoansManager` behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.
If `loans.json` exists on the hard disk, its data is loaded into `internalList`.
Otherwise, `loans.json` is created and the `LoansManager` initializes with an empty `internalList`.

Step 2. The user executes the command `loan out p/John x/4.20` to add a new loan.
This creates a new loan `toAdd` of `amount` 4.20 `out` to the `person` John, with the current `date` being used as the user did not provide one.
`LoansManager#addLoan(Loan toAdd)` is then called and `toAdd` is added to `internalList`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the process of adding a loan works:

image::LoanSequenceDiagram.png[]

In general, the rest of the operations work using a similar sequence of steps.
Some commands might create a new `Loan` object (as shown above) while others might simply use the `Index` of a loan.

Step 3. The user executes the command `loan list` to see their current list of loans.
`LoansManager#getLoans()` is called.
An immutable version of `internalList` sorted by `person` is retrieved and displayed to the user.

Step 4. The user executes the command `loan edit 1 x/500` to edit the `amount` of the first loan in the list.
This creates a new `editedLoan` identical to the first loan in `internalList`, except that `editedLoan` has an `amount` of 500.
`LoansManager#editLoan(Index toEdit, Loan editedLoan)` is then called,
where `toEdit` is the index of the first loan in `internalList`,
and `toEdit` is replaced with `editedLoan`.

Step 5. The user executes the command `loan paid 1` to update the status of the first loan in the list to *paid*.
`LoansManager#updateLoanStatus(Index toUpdate, Status newStatus)` is called
(where `toUpdate` is the index of the first loan in `internalList` and `newStatus` has the value `Status.PAID`)
and the loan at index `toUpdate` in `internalList` has its `status` updated to `newStatus`.

[NOTE]
The command `loan unpaid` works identically to `loan paid`, except that `newStatus` has the value `Status.UNPAID`.

Step 6. The user executes the command `loan delete 1` to delete the first loan in the list.
`LoansManager#deleteLoan(Index toDelete)` is called,
where `toDelete` is the index of the first loan in `internalList`,
and the loan at index `toDelete` is removed from `internalList`.

[NOTE]
For the commands `loan paid`, `loan unpaid` and `loan delete`,
if the user targets a loan outside of the list (e.g. index greater than list size)
an error message will be displayed.

===== Multi-Loan Targeting

The user can target and act on multiple loans with a single command.
For example, `loan delete 1 3 4` can be used to delete the first, third and fourth loans in `internalList`.
Alternatively or additionally, `loan delete p/John Mary` can also be used
to delete all the loans of the persons John and Mary in `internalList`.
The `LoansManager` handles this by executing the appropriate operation repeatedly.
In the case of `loan delete 1 3 4`, `LoansManager#deleteLoan(Index toDelete)` is called once for each of the three loans.

If any of the targeted loan indices cannot be found by the `LoansManager` in `internalList`, they are added to a `missingLoanIndices` list.
The `missingLoanIndices` list is then displayed to the user after all other loans have been acted upon,
notifying them that the loans with those indices could not be found.

Multi-loan targeting is implemented for the commands `loan paid`, `loan unpaid` and `loan delete`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Structure of the loan - person interaction

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `LoansManager` stores `internalList`; each `Loan` references a `Person`
** Pros: Easy to implement and understand.
** Cons: Takes a longer time to get all the loans belonging to a person.
* **Alternative 2**: `LoansManager` stores `persons` list; each `Person` stores `LoanList`; each `Loan` references `Person`
** Pros: Easy to retrieve the person of each loan and retrieve all the loans belonging to a person.
** Cons: Circular dependency and high coupling, potentially leading to lower testability and a higher bug count.
// end::loans[]

// tag::rules[]
=== Rules Feature
==== Implementation

The Rules feature exists as an integration onto the Transaction system. It makes use
of syntax processing, together with scripts to provide an automation solution to
repetitive tasks when adding transactions.

Rules are defined with a pair of predicate and action, where an action is performed
given that the predicate returns true. This predicate-action split allows us to decouple
testing from performing, which helps to increase reusability of individual predicates
and actions.

Basic attributes and operators are exposed to provide users a way of writing simple
tests on transactions without having to manually check and make changes. Storing rules
works similarly to LoansManager, where individual rules are stored in a
`RuleManager` which manages all CRUD operations.

All rules are stored in in a JSON file formatted to be retrieved and parsed by the
application when relaunched.

The following class diagram illustrates the structure of the rule model and how it
integrates with the logic.

_TODO: activity diagram_

==== Design Considerations

_TODO: design considerations_
// end::rules[]

// tag::scripts[]
=== Scripting
==== Implementation

The scripting engine works independently of the rest of the application.
At its core, it uses the Nashorn ECMAScript 5.1 engine bundled with Java 11 to
evaluate scripts.

A set of convenience functions are provided to make basic tasks, such as manipulating
transactions and accounts, easier. The full model and UI are nevertheless exposed to
scripts, and scripts are able to access any classes provided in the Java 11 standard
library, as well as any dependencies included in the application.

There is a simple mechanism to store scripts to be run in future. This works together
with rules to give the ability to have complex predicates and actions outside of
those supported inherently by the program. This also works with aliases to allow,
in effect, custom commands to be created.

The following class diagram illustrates the design of the scripting engine and model.

_TODO: Class diagram_

==== Design considerations

_TODO_

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
