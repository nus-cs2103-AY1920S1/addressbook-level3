    "description": "This seminar offers graduate students opportunities for sustained critical engagement with current debates in English language and linguistics. Students are expected to identify key issues (whether it involves the architecture of competing theories of grammar or analyses of specific grammatical phenomena) and to situate these issues within wider debates about the nature of language. The overall aim is for students to propose lines of inquiry that might contribute meaningfully to these debates. The seminar is especially useful to students seeking a more integrated understanding of the different approaches to the study of English language and linguistics.",
