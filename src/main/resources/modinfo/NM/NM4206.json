    "description": "The module examines how technological transformation of media and communications has required nation states to make big adjustments in regulatory frameworks. These changes in the areas of jurisdiction, content regulation, moral values, security, etc. will be explored, as well as their global implications and regulatory constraints of the Internet. This module explores new media governance processes that involve collective action by governments, international organisations, NGOs, the private sector and civil society to establish agreements about standards, policies, rules, enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution procedures. It will emphasise challenges it presents to stakeholders and how sometimes trade-offs are necessary.",
