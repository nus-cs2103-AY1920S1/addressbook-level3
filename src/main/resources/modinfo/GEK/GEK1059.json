    "description": "With special reference to Singapore, this module examines English \u2013 especially its standard form - as the leading global linguistic and cultural resource for intra- and inter-cultural communication. Students use a variety of tools to analyse language in terms of phonetics, lexis, grammar, and meaning in context. We ask questions such as the following: (1) Why does the idea of \u2018standard language\u2019 appeal to human cultures?; (2) What does \u2018standard English\u2019 comprise?; (3) What happens to the shape of English when local culture is blended in? (4) Are \u2018native speakers\u2019 really native?; (5) Does 'Standard Singapore English' exist?",
