    "description": "Double Degree Programme (DDP) students may complete the Integrated Honours Thesis (IHT), a single thesis which will count towards the requirements and CAP computation of both degrees. The IHT aims to provide students with the opportunity of exploring the confluence of their two disciplines. It will be jointly supervised by faculty members from both faculties. Students intending to read this module are expected to consult prospective supervisors the semester before they embark on the IHT and provide a research proposal. Students are open to conduct research on a wide range of topics as long as it is related to psychology.",
