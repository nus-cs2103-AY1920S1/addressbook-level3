    "description": "The South Asian presence in Singapore is an important part of Singapore?s multicultural society: in terms of the `Indian' community and its economic and commercial influence; its religious and artistic impact; and its role in the everyday life of the nation (eg. cuisine, sport and entertainment). Students will be provided the opportunity to understand the nature of South Asian migration to Singapore, the significance of the South Asian community and its contributions to Singapore's development.  Students will be provided with the necessary framework to study and analyse the historical and socio-economic development of the community and South Asian identity and concerns.  The module will develop critical and analytical skills guiding students in the process of social scientific enquiry. The target students are undergraduates from all Faculties.",
