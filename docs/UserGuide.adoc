== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and notifs. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary
management
to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.

[[Command-Specifications]]
== Command Specifications

Before diving into the features that Mortago has for you, you need to know several key information on how to use Mortago.
The following sections elaborate on these key information, such as the general format for commands in Mortago.

=== Command Format

Most commands in Mortago follow the general format: `COMMAND_WORD -FLAG ATTRIBUTES`

* `COMMAND_WORD` specifies what you want Mortago to do.
** eg. `add` tells Mortago to create an entry according to the details that you supply in the later half of the command.
* `-FLAG` specifies what type of entity in Mortago you are referring to.
** There are 3 types of entities in Mortago: worker, body and fridge. Each of them has its respective `-FLAG`, given below:
*** `-w` indicates a worker
*** `-b` indicates a body
*** `-f` indicates a fridge
* `ATTRIBUTES` specifies the information about an entity that you need to supply for the command to be executed
successfully. The following section elaborates more on what `ATTRIBUTES` are in Mortago.

=== Attributes

|===
a|
[TIP]
What are `ATTRIBUTES`?
a| Attributes are properties of a worker, body or fridge that are supplied by you when executing a command.

For example, `name` is an attribute for both body and worker entities.

The full list of attributes for each entity can be found in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>.

|===

Here are some information you need in order to interpret the various command formats in this User Guide.

* You can find that `ATTRIBUTES` in this User Guide are represented with the format: `/attributeName attributeValue`
** You should always provide the `/attributeName`, exactly as it is stated in the User Guide, before specifying the details of the `attributeValue` that the entity has.
** For example, date of births in Mortago are represented using `/dob dateOfBirth`. Therefore, the `/attributeName` is `/dob` and `attributeValue` is `dateOfBirth`. If you wish to specify an entity born on 12 December 2000, you should key it as `/dob 12/12/2000`.

* You may find that some `ATTRIBUTES` can only accept specific values, or that these values must follow certain format. You can refer to <<Valid-Values, Appendix 7.1>> for the full list of valid values or format for these `ATTRIBUTES`.

* You must enter `ATTRIBUTES` successively in a single-line command. Mortago does not prompt you to key in any mandatory
 `ATTRIBUTES` that you may have missed out.

* `ATTRIBUTES` are provided successively in commands and Mortago does not prompt you, step by step, the `ATTRIBUTES` you
need to provide.
* `ATTRIBUTES` in parentheses are optional.
** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b /name name (/religion religion /status status)`.
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism`
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
* `ATTRIBUTES` specified in a command can be given in any order.
** e.g. The following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b (/religion religion /status status)`.
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
*** `add -b /status arrived /religion Buddhism`
* `ATTRIBUTES` that are tagged with `...` and in square parentheses must be supplied with at least one `ATTRIBUTE`.
** For the filter command: `filter [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`::
*** `filter /name John` and `filter /sex female` are valid commands.
*** `filter` is an invalid command.

* You are not required to provide `ATTRIBUTES` contained in parentheses.
** For example, the following 3 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b /name name /sex sex /doa dateOfAdmission (/religion religion) (/status status)`.
*** `add -b /name John /sex Male /doa 12/12/2011`
*** `add -b /name John /sex Male /doa 12/12/2011 /religion Buddhism`
*** `add -b /name John /sex Male /doa 12/12/2011 /religion Buddhism /status arrived`

* You must provide *at least one* `ATTRIBUTE` when `ATTRIBUTES` are tagged with `...` and contained in square parentheses (`[]`).
** For the filter command: `filter [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`:
*** `filter /name John` and `filter /sex female` are valid commands.
*** `filter` is an invalid command.


=== Identification Number

This section describes what Identification Numbers are in Mortago. This information is key in order for you to use Mortago effectively.

* All entries in Mortago have a unique Identification Number tagged to it.
* The identification number is automatically generated by Mortago for your convenience.
* Identification numbers in Mortago follow the format as shown below, where `#` is a number from 0-9:
** `body` entries: `B\\####\####`
** `worker` entries: `W\\#####`
** `fridge` entries: `F##`
* If you need to enter the identification number of an entity for a command, providing the number (e.g. `20` instead of `W00020`) is sufficient.

| Body added

|===
// end::add[]

// tag::update[]

[[update]]
==== Updating an entity: `update`

You can update the attributes of a body or worker by entering an update command with the given format below.. +

You have to indicate the entity type you want to update with a flag, as described in <<Command Format>>.
[TIP]
`-f` is not a valid flag for this command. Fridges are automatically updated when bodies are assigned or removed.

You can specify one or more attributes to change, but at least one valid attribute must be provided.

Format: `update -FLAG /id id [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`



When you update the `fridgeId` of a `Body`, changes to the fridges are made as follows:

* Previous fridge's status is set to `UNOCCUPIED` and is no longer assigned this `Body`.

* New fridge's status is set to `OCCUPIED` and is assigned this `Body`.

When you update the status of a `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE`, the `Notif` associated with the `Body` is automatically
deleted.

When you update `bodyStatus` to `ARRIVED`, a `Notif` pop-up is be shown after 10 seconds.

When a `Body` is assigned a `Fridge` and you update its status to `CLAIMED` or `DONATED`, it is removed from the
 `Fridge` and its status is set to `UNOCCUPIED`.

There are some attributes that you can update once the entity is created. For this command,
the list of valid attributes and their command prefixes can be found below:

[cols="2,2"]
|===

| Body | Worker

a|
====
Name `/name` +
Sex `/sex` +
NRIC `/nric` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date of Death `/dod` +

|===

[TIP]
Make sure you key in dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY.

Example: +
Imagine that someone (Jane Doe) just got promoted! You have to change her designation to 'Manager' in Mortago.

Instead of typing out all the irrelevant attributes a Worker has, you just have to input her ID number
and her new designation.

To update Jane Doe's designation: +
1) Locate her identification number on the dashboard. You see on the dashboard that her ID number is W00001. +

2) Type `update -w /id 1 /designation Manager` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it. +

3) The result box indicates that the `delete` command has been undone. +

4) You can also see  on the dashboard that Jane Doe's designation has been updated.


|===
| Command | Expected Output

| `update -w /id 1 /designation Senior Autopsy Technician`
| Designation of Jane Doe changed to Senior Autopsy Technician.
|===
// end::update[]

// tag::find[]

==== Locating entries by name: `find`

You can find bodies or workers whose names contain any of the given keywords by entering a find command with the given format below. +

[TIP]
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` matches `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words are matched e.g. `Han` is not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword is returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` returns `Hans Gruber`, `Bo
Yang`


Format: `find -FLAG [keyword...]`

Examples:

* `find -b John` +
Returns any bodies having names `John`
* `find -w Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any workers having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

// end::find[]


// tag::delete[]

==== Deleting an entry : `delete` +
You can delete a body, worker or fridge entry, using its Identification Number by entering a delete command with the
given format below. +

Format: `delete -FLAG  id`

You only need to enter the numeric value of the Identification Number while ignoring the prefixed 0s. For example, if
you want to delete a `Fridge` with id `F01`, you need to only enter `delete -f 1`.

When you delete a `Body`:

* Mortago automatically deletes its associated `Notifs`. You can learn more
about `Notifs` in <<showNotifs, Section 3.2.1>>.
* If you had assigned a `Fridge` to this `Body`, Mortago automatically sets the status of the `Fridge` to
`UNOCCUPIED`.

You cannot delete a `Fridge` with status `OCCUPIED`. To still proceed with deletion, you need to either delete the
`Body` or assign it to another `Fridge`.

Example:

Imagine that you added someone (Jim Kerr) by mistake and you want to remove his details from Mortago. You see that his
ID number is W00003.

To delete his record:

1) Type `delete -w 3` and press `ENTER` to execute it.

image::delete-command/DeleteStep1.png[]

2) The result box displays the message as shown below.

image::delete-command/DeleteStep2.png[]

3) And you can check that Jim Kerr is no longer in the list of workers.

image::delete-command/DeleteStep3.png[width="500"]

// end::delete

// tag::clear[]

==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

You can clear all entries from Mortago by entering a clear command given below.
Format: `clear`

// end::clear[]

// tag::list[]

==== List all entries : `list`
You can list all entries of bodies, workers, or fridges.

Format: `list -FLAG`

|===
| Flags | Usage
| -b | View all bodies.
| -w | View all workers.
| -f | View all fridges.
|===

Example: `list -b` +
After filtering specific bodies, you may now want to view the full list of bodies:

1) Mortago shows filtered list of bodies.

image::List1.png[]

2) Type `list -b` in the Command Line Interface (CLI).

image::List2.png[]

3) Mortago shows unfiltered list of bodies.

image::List3.png[]

// end::list[]

// tag::select[]

====  Selecting a body: `select`

You can select a body and view its full details by entering a select command with the given format below.

Format: `select id`

Example: `select 1` +

View a body with the ID B00000001.





// end::select[]

=== General

// tag::notifs[]
[[showNotifs]]
==== View notifs panel: `showNotifs` +
This command allows you to view all `Notif`(s).

A `Notif` is a notification associated with a `Body`. In Singapore, if the next-of-kin is not contactable for more
than 24 hours from the time of admission of a `Body`,
police must informed. Mortago removes the hassle of manually keeping track of the status of bodies! For the purpose of
testing, instead of 24 hours, Mortago currently
uses 10 seconds.

When you add a `Body` or manually set its status to `ARRIVED`, Mortago
automatically
changes its status to `CONTACT_POLICE` if its status is still `ARRIVED` after 10 seconds. It then shows a pop-up
to
remind you to
contact the police. It creates a `Notif` for this `Body` and you can view all `Notif`(s) by either clicking on the
notification bell or typing the `showNotif` command.

Format: `showNotifs`

Once you change the status of the `Body` from `CONTACT_POLICE` to any other possible status as described in
<<bodyStatus, Section 8.1>>,
its associated `Notif` is deleted.

If you change the status of the `Body` before 10 seconds, no pop-up and `Notif` are created.

Example:

Imagine that a new `Body` (John Doe) has just arrived at your mortuary.

1) Type the `add` command as specified in the example in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>. Currently the status of this `Body`
is `ARRIVED`

image::notif-command/Notif1.png[]

2) Wait for 10 seconds. Mortago automatically changes the status of the `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE` and shows
you a
pop-up
notification.

image::notif-command/Notif2.png[]

3) Type `showNotif` and press `ENTER` to execute it.

image::notif-command/Notif3.png[]

4) The notification bell opens up a panel and lists all the bodies for which you need to contact the police. You
can see John Doe's ID number B00000020 is in the list.

image::notif-command/Notif4.png[]

5) Suppose you have contacted the police, change the status of John Doe using the command `update -b /id 20 /status
pending police report`. John Doe's ID is no longer listed in the notifs panel.

image::notif-command/Notif5.png[]

// end::notifs[]

==== Filter all entries: `filter`
You can filter all entries according to the given keywords in any of an entry’s attributes by entering a filter command with the given format below.

All entries with matching keywords are displayed. Keyword is case-insensitive.

All attributes of a body or worker entry can be filtered. If more than one attribute is specified, the entries
displayed must fulfill all attributes. Please refer to <<add, Section 3.1.1>> for the different fields available to be
filtered.

Format: `filter -FLAG [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`

Example:

* `filter -w /sex female` +
All female worker entries are displayed.

* `filter -b /cod Car Accident /sex male` +
All body entries with car accident as the cause of death and those that are male are displayed.
// end::filter[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing a command: `undo`
You can undo the effects of the last command you executed with `undo`.
This command lets you undo up to 10 most recent commands, one at a time.
The commands are undone starting from the most recent to the least recent.

Format: `undo` or `u`

The `add`, `update`, `clear`, and `delete` commands can be undone.
Commands like `list` or `find` cannot be undone.

Commands caused by automated commands, such as an `UpdateCommand` caused by `Notif` can be undone and redone.
For example, the automatic status change of a `Body` from `ARRIVED` to `CONTACT_POLICE`  is caused by an `UpdateCommand` and can be undone and redone. However, note that this feature does not support
the `NotifCommand` itself. For example, if a `Body` was added and deleted before the `NotifCommand` associated with it has executed,
undoing the deletion does not restore the `NotifCommand`.

Though you can `undo` a `clear` command, note that you cannot redo any past undone commands after that.

Example: +
Imagine that you wanted to delete a `Body` with ID 10 from Mortago. However, your finger slips and you type `20` instead
of `10`!

image::Undo2.png[]

You don't realise and execute the command. When you look at the dashboard, you realise you have deleted body 20.
Even worse, you have no recollection of body 20's name or information.

image::UndoBodyDeleted.png[]


You can easily reverse that mistake with the `undo` command instead of adding body 20 all over again!

To undo:

1) Type `undo` or `u` into the command box.

image::Undo4.png[]

2) Press `Enter` to execute the command.

image::Undo5.png[]

3) Notice that the result box shows text telling you what was undone, and body 20 is back in the list of bodies.


==== Redoing a command: `redo`
You can redo the effects of the last command you executed with `redo`.
This command lets you redo up to 10 most recent undone commands, one at a time.
All commands that can be undone can be redone. (See <<Undoing a command: `undo`>> for how `undo` can be used.)

Format: `redo` or `r`

[TIP]
A command can only be redone if it has been undone before.

Example: +
Imagine that you've previously executed `undo` to undo deleting body 20. You look at the data again and realise you've deleted the right thing after all!

Instead of deleting body 20 again, simply `redo` the command.

To redo:

1) Type `redo` or `r` into the command box.

2) Press `Enter` to execute the command.

3) Notice that the result box shows text telling you what was executed when redoing, and body 20 is now absent
from the list of bodies.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::exit[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

You can exit the program by entering an exit command given below. +
Format: `exit`

// end::exit[]

// tag::sortfilter[]

==== Sort all entries: `sort` `[coming in v2.0]`
Sort all displayed entries according to a given order. Only body and worker entries can be sorted.
Sort only works on the entries that are in view. For example, to sort body entries, the you need to first navigate to the bodies view.
Types of ordering can be found below:

* `name`: entries are sorted by alphabetical order of their names
* `id`: entries are sorted by their id number, in descending order (newest entry appear first)
** `id asc`: entries are sorted in ascending order of id number
** `id desc`: entries are sorted in descending order of id number
*** If neither 'asc' or 'desc' qualifiers are supplied, the ordering is by default descending.
* `status`: entries are sorted by their statuses in this order:

Format: `sort /order order`

Example:

* `sort /order status` +
All entries are sorted and grouped according to their statuses.
* `sort /order id asc` +
All entries are sorted according to their id number in ascending order.
