    "description": "Ghosts and spirits have been subjects of perennial interest in different human societies. At the same time, beliefs about persons with powers to initiate injury or good, and their relationship with spirits are found in almost all cultures throughout human history. This module introduces students to the scholarly study of ghosts and spirits, and the specialists and practitioners involved with these forces. These include shamanism, spirit possession, witchcraft and sorcery, and other supernatural entities such as zombies, vampires and werewolves, and how these intersect with issues of class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, citizenship, popular culture, modernity and social change.",
