    "description": "The course focuses on developing a framework for constructing and rethinking factors (be they economic, political, cultural) that have led to the emergence, development, and maintenance of certain forms of collective behaviour. It will also examine these theories through various case studies of social movements such as historical revolutions, and the \"new\" social movements of Europe. Topics covered include the rationality of collective action; history of social movement theory; the role of individuals, social groups and institutions in social movements; and their impacts. This module is mounted for students with interest in social movements.",
