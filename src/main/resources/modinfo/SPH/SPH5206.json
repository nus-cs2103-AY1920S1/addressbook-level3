    "description": "We live in a densely populated modern city state that earns its living as an international trade and travel hub. Students will learn about constraints and vulnerabilities in our physico-social ecology, and how to balance the natural tropical biosphere and man-made technosphere in the face of climate, economic and lifestyle changes. Risk assessment and management form the basis for health protection, safeguarding against emergent threats, and skills-building in risk communications promotes right attitudes and behaviours for community wellbeing. This module provides a combination of hard and soft science approaches that will guide field epidemiologists in urban health security.",
