    "description": "The aim of the module is to expose students not only to arts with digital media, but also let them develop their own art works. Students practise the analysis and interpretation of arts and become familiar with the major shifts of the arts in the 20th century and the basics of postmodern aesthetics. During the production of creative works, the focus lies on the training of conceptual skills. Similarities between artistic and strategic creativity are investigated. The connection between art and leadership, the tradition of the avant-garde and a discussion about favourable conditions for innovation in a society serve to round up the module.",
