== Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio showcases my contribution to the Athletick project.

=== About the team

Our team comprises of five second-year computer science undergraduates from
the National University of Singapore (NUS).

=== About the project

This project is a 6 weeks long project for our software engineering module.
We were tasked to either enhance or morph a command line interface
Address Book application and one of the main constraints for this project is that
it has to remain as a command line interface application.

What we decided to do was to morph the existing address book application to a team
management application called Athletick. Athletick is designed for captains and
coaches of timing-based performance sports to help take and keep track of attendance
and performance of their teams. Other main features of Athletick include viewing of the training calendar
and performance graph.

My role was to design and implement the code for the `undo` and `redo` features.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as
well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

NOTE: This symbol indicates important information

[horizontal]
`command`:: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command line and executed by the application.

`[green]#component#`:: Green text with grey highlight indicates a component, class, object or method in the architecture of the application.


== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.

 * What it does
** The `undo` command allows the user to undo a previous command. The user may
reverse this `undo` command with the `redo` command.
 * Justification
** In the event that users have made a mistake or changed their minds about executing
a command, the `undo` command enables them to revert to a version immediately before the mistaken command
was executed. If they change their minds again and decide to execute the command after all,
then the `redo` command enables them to do so easily.
 * Highlights
** This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands.

** An in-depth analysis of design
alternatives was necessary to weigh the different alternatives and decide on the implementation for this enhancement.

** The implementation was challenging as it required a full understanding of
the major components of the application and the existing features implementations.
Also, the enhancement had to be implemented in a way that the future enhancements for any future
features are able to be easily integrated into the current implementation.
