    "description": "Viruses are the tiniest but most numerous inhabitants of Earth. Although\nviruses notoriously cause deadly epidemics, not all viruses are bad and\nmany are beneficial to their hosts and vital for ecosystem health. This\ncourse explores the \u2018good, bad and ugly\u2019 effects of viruses on biological\nsystems. We examine how viruses invade host genomes, thwart host\ndefenses, stymie conservation efforts, and change human history through\ndeadly epidemics. But we also explore virus benefits, especially in\nbiotechnology: biocontrol of pests, anti-cancer treatments, and therapies\ntargeting other pathogens. Viruses dominate the planet, affecting our lives\nfor better and for worse.",
