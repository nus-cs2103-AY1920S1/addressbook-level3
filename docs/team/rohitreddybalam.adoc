== Overview

This documents gives an insight to the contributions I made to EatMe, a personalized food diary application.
I worked along with a team of 4 other Computer Science Students to morph the existing Address Book 3
application into EatMe.

EatMe helps users to keep track of the places they have been to, mouthwatering
dishes that they consumed, and also stay up to date with the latest trends in the world of food.
Users interact with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI) and it also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
created using JavaFX. The application is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

This is how the application looks like:

== Summary of Contributions

* *Code contributed* : https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=ROHITREDDYBALAM[Code contributed]

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *Review (Add, Edit, Delete)* feature

** EatMe being a food 'diary' app, the central feature is the ability to write down your experiences, view them
in the future, and make changes if necessary. The review feature allows users to add reviews to an eatery, edit the reviews added and even delete them.

** In the process of morphing the Address Book into EatMe, all the attributes of an Eatery only had
a single piece of information associated with them, like the Address attribute. However, a review
consists of description, price, rating and time of the meal. This arrangement made it quite challenging
to store and edit reviews. On the brighter side, the user can now decide where and what to eat quickly
by taking a glance at the reviews' costs and ratings. In the event that the users input a review wrongly,
they can edit or delete them at their will.

* *Other enhancements*: Added the *AddTag* and *RemoveTag* features

** Originally, the only way to add or remove tags was by using the `edit` command, which replaced
all the existing tags with the new input. If an eatery was tagged as `#good`, `#expensive`, `#Chinese`, `#elder-friendly`,
and the user wanted to delete the `#expensive` tag, he would have had to input
`edit [id] \t good \t Chinese \t elder-friendly` as the existing tags were replaced by the new ones.
It is very frustrating if the eatery is associated with multiple tags and the user just wants to edit one.

** So, I came up with the *AddTag* and *RemoveTag* features that operate only on the tags specified by the user.
Now, `removetag [id] \t expensive` is used to remove the `#expensive` tag. Likewise, `addtag [id] \t ...`
will be used to add the required tags. The effects are cumulative, allowing the user to operate efficiently.
