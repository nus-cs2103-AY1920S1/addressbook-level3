    "description": "The module focuses on the blurring of boundaries between forms, modes, and methods of communication through the emergence of new media. Drawing on the cultural heritage of selected Asian societies, through art, architecture and oral narratives, students will re\u2010interpret these cultural text and meanings to exhibit them in new media forms. In this sense then, new media not only offer opportunities for convergence and integration across various forms of expression, but they also fundamentally reshape our understanding of communication. Students will showcase traditional cultural communication through digital archives, a cloud museum, blogs and design online experiential books, digital performance, and digital art.",
