== PROJECT: AlgoBase

== Overview

AlgoBase is primarily a problem management application, where users can add different algorithm problems from all kinds of sources. Within the application, users can create training plans consisting of tasks, where each task is a problem that the user has to complete. Upon completing a task, users can mark it as done, which contributes to the progress of their plan. Users interact with AlgoBase using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

The figure below illustrates the layout of the AlgoBase application:

My role was to design and write the codes for the training plan feature. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user guide and developer guide.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the training plan feature*
** What it does: Allows users to create customized training plans with specific starting date and end date and that consist of selected problems in AlgoBase. Each problem is wrapped up as a task in the plan. Users can record their progress by marking problems in plans as done or undone, and they can edit, delete or search for plans.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it would be inconvenient for a hard-working user to manage a large number of problems without a higher-level component that categorize selected problems.
** Highlights: This feature enables users to set specific duration for a training plan, which provides the possibility of various potential enhancements in the future, such as alarming for deadlines, and thus will make AlgoBase more attractive to users.

* *Minor enhancement to existing project*: refactored part of *command and parsers*
