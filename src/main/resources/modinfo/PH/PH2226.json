    "description": "This module examines the development of the concept of nature, the different roles it serves in the inquiry of various disciplines, from philosophy, the natural sciences, to literature and art, how these disciplines transform our conceptions of nature over time, and influence our interactions with nature. The module will compare different cultural traditions in their understandings of, attitudes towards, and practical interactions with, nature. It will also examine the barriers created by disciplinary differences and specializations and consider the potential of more integrated approaches to human interactions with nature.",
