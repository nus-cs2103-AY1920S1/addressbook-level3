    "description": "Genetic engineering is the ability to manipulate DNA sequences to alter the characteristics of an organism. iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) is an annual contest for students to use a toolkit of genetic elements, or additional elements of their own design, to create novel and useful biological systems. This module introduces students to the fundamentals of gene regulation and to the principles of genetic engineering. The kinds of things done by student groups in iGEM will be explored, and the possibility of a Yale-NUS iGEM team discussed. No prior knowledge or expertise is assumed.",
