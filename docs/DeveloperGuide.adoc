== Implementation
This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

==== Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the toggle panel command works:

==== Design Considerations

*Current method:* Toggle the panels from within MainWindow class.

Pros: Easy to implement.

Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.
