    "description": "The Anthropocene is the proposed term meant to\ndesignate a new epoch in Earth\u2019s geological history in\nwhich we, the anthropos, have become a geological force.\nFrom rising sea levels, spiking temperature, to mass\nextinctions, humanity has not simply changed the\nbiogeochemical profile of the Earth but done so to the point\nof threatening its very survival. In its altered state, the\nEarth appears increasingly unable to sustain the\nagricultural, energy, and capital networks that humanity\nhas built to drive itself. The Anthropocene, in other words,\nfigures man as a primary agent of a grand planetary drama\nat the same time it stymies his ability to act. This module\nexamines the notion of agency in the conditions of the\nAnthropocene. It asks what a warming, liquefying, dying\nworld might reveal about the realities and limits of our\nagency?",
