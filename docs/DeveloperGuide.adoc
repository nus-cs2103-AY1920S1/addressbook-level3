== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` in the Memes tab.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemeGridPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses a `WemeParser` to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a meme).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `MemeDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Weme data in `Weme`.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Meme>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Template>`.
* stores and exposes the current Weme context (will be discussed later)
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Meme Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.weme.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

The Undo and Redo commands are necessary to give users the flexibility of undoing or redoing a wrongly executed command. Especially in Weme where we deal with image files, it is possible to key in the wrong file when adding a meme. Hence, simply entering the command `undo` allows the user to revert this mistake and add the correct file accordingly.

==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedWeme`.
`VersionedWeme` extends `Weme` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `versionedWemeStates`, `stateIndex` and a `feedbackList`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedWeme#commit()` -- Saves the current Weme state in its history.
* `VersionedWeme#undo()` -- Restores the previous Weme state from its history and returns the feedback message of the undone command.
* `VersionedWeme#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone Weme state from its history and returns the feedback message of the redone command.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitWeme()`, `Model#undoWeme()` and `Model#redoWeme()` respectively.

[NOTE]
Only state changes on the internal structure of Weme are undoable.

// tag::undoable[]

Commands such as `list`, `find` that only change the user interface, commands such as `export` and `load` that are related to external files, as well as commands such as `edit` and `delete` in the import tab that modifies the import list are not supported.

These are the list of commands that support undo / redo operations:

* Memes Tab: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `like`, `dislike`, `stage`
* Templates Tab: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `use`
* Create Tab: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `move`, `abort`, `create`
* Export Tab: `unstage`, `clear`
* Import Tab: `import`

`undo` and `redo` works between tabs. This means that if you make a change in the Memes tab, by editing a meme, and then you switch to the Templates tab, when you execute `undo`, it reverts the change in the Memes tab as well. However, `undo`/`redo` is not usable while viewing a meme.

// end::undoable[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedWeme` will be initialized with the initial Weme state, and the `stateIndex` pointing to that single Weme state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th meme in the meme list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitWeme()` with the success feedback message as a parameter, causing the modified state of the Weme after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `versionedWemeStates`, the `stateIndex` is shifted to the newly inserted Weme state, and finally the delete command's feedback message is inserted into the `feedbackList`.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `edit 2 d/surprised pikachu` to edit a meme's description. The `edit` command also calls `Model#commitWeme()`, causing another modified Weme state to be saved into the `versionedWemeStates`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitWeme()`, so the Weme state will not be saved into the `versionedWemeStates`.

Step 4. The user now decides that editing the meme was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoWeme()`, which will shift the `stateIndex` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Weme state, and restores the Weme to that state. The feedback message is then returned to pass into and construct the CommandResult.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `stateIndex` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Weme state, then there are no previous Weme states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoWeme()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoWeme()`, which shifts the `stateIndex` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Weme to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `stateIndex` is at index `versionedWemeStates.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Weme state, then there are no undone Weme states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoWeme()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Weme, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitWeme()`, `Model#undoWeme()` or `Model#redoWeme()`. Thus, the `versionedWemeStates` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitWeme()`. Since the `stateIndex` is not pointing at the end of the `versionedWemeStates`, all Weme states after the `stateIndex` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `edit 2 d/surprised pikachu` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

The addition of undo redo complicates certain commands. An example of this complication is when undoing add or delete commands. Originally, deleting a Meme will delete the corresponding image file on the disk. However, this means it is not possible to retrieve the file afterwards when attempting to undo. Hence, the current implementation is to delete the Meme entry in the json, but keep the original image file until Weme is closed. When Weme is closed, a thread will clean up all unreferenced image files in the image folder. This is part of the reason why certain commands such as `load` are not supported.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clean up works:

image::CleanUpSequenceDiagram.png[]

When the handleExit command is called, MainWindow will create a Thread to call `logic.cleanUp()` to prevent the GUI from slowing down. The thread then further spawns other threads to clean up the files in the data folder, deleting those images that are not found in the memes and templates list stored on Weme. The `cleanTemplateStorage()` part of the UML diagram has been truncated as it is similar to `cleanMemeStorage()`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the meme being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct. This gets complicated when dealing with files.

===== Aspect: Types of commands to undo

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Includes only commands that modify the underlying data. (Add, Edit, Clear, Delete)
** Pros: Only changes that permanently affect the application are reverted.
** Cons: Might be less intuitive as a user calling `tab templates` then `undo` might expect to revert the Tab command instead.
* **Alternative 2:** Includes all commands
** Pros: Intuitive
** Cons: Might be very troublesome for a user if they want to revert the state instead of the view. More unexpected behaviours as certain commands such as `load` depends on files outside Weme's data folder. If there is an error on redoing a command, there is no easy way to find out.

===== Aspect: Context for commands to be undoable

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow undoing throughout the application regardless of context.
** Pros: User in a different context is able to easily undo the state.
** Cons: User might expect to undo only when they are in the same context. i.e. Undo Meme commands in Meme context.
* **Alternative 2:** Restrict undoing to its own context
** Pros: More user intuitive. Commands will only affect their own context.
** Cons: Heavily complicates the model. Model will then need to keep track of a versioning of every single context. Does not allow for commands such as `create` which affects the Creation tab and Memes tab without many modifications to the existing structure.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of past states.
** Pros: Easy to understand and adjust according to needs. Undo and redo simply moves along the list to change the state.
** Cons: Clutters up the `Weme` class.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a wrapper class
** Pros: Everything will be handled within a single UndoRedoManager class.
** Cons: Might introduce complications as managing states now needs to go through another class instead of just the model.

===== Aspect: Handling file changes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Remove files only on exit.
** Pros: No need to deal with files when managing commands. Easy to execute add and delete commands without an issue without worrying whether a file is present.
** Cons: Might take a while to delete if we had a lot of images. (Resolved with threads)
* **Alternative 2:** Implement a recycle bin to move files to/from on command.
** Pros: Commands do what they are fully expected to do (Delete deletes the image as well).
** Cons: Heavily complicates the logic with a need to copy and paste when undoing and redoing. Very difficult to understand and error-prone. Still needs to eventually clear the recycle bin on exit. Repeated work.
* **Alternative 3:** Make file-related commands undoable.
** Pros: No need to deal with file manipulation.
** Cons: Makes undo redo feature a lot more useless as it loses support for certain key commands.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::templates[]
=== Templates feature
Many memes are created from templates. Meme lovers often store a list of templates and process them to generate new memes when needed.
A template typically reserves whitespace for the user to fill in text to give the template meanings.
Weme provides this feature and allows the users to store their favourite templates and generate memes with the templates.

==== Current Implementation

Like a `Meme`, a `Template` also has an associated image that is stored on the hard disk.
Each `Template` object has 2 fields, `Name` and `ImagePath`, where `Name` serves as the identifier and `ImagePath` holds the path to the image of this template.
A user can add, edit, delete, or find a template.

.Partial class diagram showing only classes in `Model` related to `Template`
image::TemplateClassDiagram.png[]

Templates are stored together with `Memes` in `Weme`. Refer to the model class diagram above for details.

When the user requests to generate a meme using a template, Weme enters the "*Create*" tab.
The user can then use commands to add text to the template image.
Meme creation is supported internally by the `MemeCreation` class.
A `MemeCreation` object represents a meme creation session (which can be empty when the user is not creating a meme).
Once a session is activated, the `MemeCreation` object stores a `BufferedImage` of the template and a list of `MemeText` objects, which represent text that the user wants to add to the template.
Every time the user adds text, the list of `MemeText` gets updated.
When the UI requests for the updated image, `MemeCreation` generates it on the fly with all the `MemeText` applied.
When the user is done, `MemeCreation` creates a new `Meme` with all the added text included and saves it in the meme collection.

.Partial class diagram showing only classes in `Model` related to `MemeCreation`
image::MemeCreationClassDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario of meme creation using a template.

Step 1. The user launches the application and enters the *Templates* tab.

Step 2. The user executes `find doge` command to find the _doge_ template.
The `FilteredList<Template>` in `ModelManager` is updated with a predicate that matches only templates whose names match _doge_.

Step 3. Assuming the template that the user wants to use is displayed as the first template, the user executes `use 1` to start creating a meme using that template.
Weme starts a new `MemeCreation` session and enters the "*Create*" tab.

Step 4. The user executes `add cs students be like x/0.5 y/0.3` command to add the text "cs students be like".
A new `MemeText` is created and added to the list in the current `MemeCreation` session.
The UI requests `MemeCreation` to render the resultant image, and `MemeCreation` returns an image with the text "cs students be like"
whose center is placed 50% horizontally from the left border and 30% vertically from the top border.

Step 5. The user decides that there is a typo in the text because "cs" is not capitalized.
The user executes the command `edit 1 t/CS students be like` to edit the text labelled *1*, which is the text that was just added.
`MemeCreation` changes the text of this `MemeText` from "cs students be like" to "CS students be like".
Upon request by the UI, `MemeCreation` generates the updated image for the UI for display.

Step 6. The user wants to move the text.
The user types `move 1` into the command box and uses arrow keys to adjust the text position.
The user holds kbd:[Shift] to make large adjustments at first, then holds kbd:[Alt] to make small adjustments until the text is at the desired position.
`CommandBox` listens to key presses and dispatches a `TextMoveCommand` on each key press.
It also throttles the key press rate to prevent firing commands too frequently.
`MemeCreation` generates a new image on each command received and the UI keeps the displayed image up-to date.

Step 7. The user executes `create d/A meme about CS students t/funny t/CS` to complete the creation session.
Weme will create a new image with the text added and save it to the data directory.
Weme will also create a new `Meme` entry with that image, with description "A meme about CS students" and tags "funny" and "CS".
The description and tag arguments are similar to those for `Meme` add command.
Weme displays the newly created meme, as if from a `view` command.

[NOTE]
The user can abort any meme creation session by typing `abort`.
This will put Weme back to displaying the content of the *Templates* tab.

The following activity diagram summarizes the meme creation process:

image::MemeCreationActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the user adds a piece of text.

image::TextAddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store and update the image

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only store the initial image and a list of text. Re-generate an image when it is requested by the UI.
** Pros: Can edit/delete text after they are added.
** Cons: Waste resources by repeatedly rendering largely similar images.
* **Alternative 2:** Always store the updated image. Update the image whenever a piece of text is added.
** Pros: Less performance overhead, only render what is needed.
** Cons: Cannot edit/delete text.

===== Aspect: How the user adds/deletes text

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The user enters commands to add/edit/move/delete text.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Integrates well with the rest of the product.
** Cons: It is troublesome to type in the coordinates and difficult to position the text accurately.
** Mitigation measure: Provide rulers beside the image as visual aid for the user, support using arrow keys to move text.
* **Alternative 2:** The user manipulates the UI through individual key strokes (Vim-like modal key-bindings)
For example, `a` to add a piece of text, arrow keys to adjust the position of the currently selected text,
`1` to select text labelled *1* and `d` to delete the currently selected text.
** Pros: The user can accurately adjust the position of the text.
** Cons: Very hard to implement. Requires major work on the UI. Must use extra care to make sure the state transitions are correct.
* **Alternative 3:** The user moves the text using the mouse
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for new users. New users do not need to learn the commands.
** Cons: Breaks the keyboard-driven workflow. Using the mouse might actually be less accurate when positioning text.

===== Aspect: How to specify the position of text coordinates

* **Alternative 1:** The user specifies where the top-left corner of the text should be.
** Pros: Might be more useful if the user wants to place the text right after another piece of text.
** Cons: User will be unsure where the text will end. Might need to use the `move` command afterwards to adjust the text position after seeing its length.
* **Alternative 2(current choice):** The user specifies where the center of the text should be.
** Pros: Easier to specify where the text will eventually be.
For example, when the text should be at the center, the user simply specifies `x/0.5 y/0.5`, instead of doing a visual estimate of how the long text would be and specifying its top-left corner's coordinates.
** Cons: New users might be more used to specifying the top-left corner's coordinates and think there is a bug in the product.

// end::templates[]

// tag::stats[]
=== Statistics feature 1: Like/Dislike Meme

It is important to include a like and meme feature such that
the user gets to indicate their preference of certain memes.
This is part of the statistics feature and isolated from the main Weme.
The like and dislike data can be used for other statistical analysis.

==== Current Implementation

Like and dislike data of the memes are stored inside `LikeData` and `DislikeData` classes.
It is built upon the infrastructure of statistics.
Statistics infrastructure is under `Weme` structure.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

An interface for statistics `Stats` is set up for access to statistics components.
`StatsManager` implements it and manages and carries `LikeManager`, which manages `LikeData` and `DislikeData` access.
`Stats` exposes the `LikeData` and `DislikeData` as an unmodifiable `ObservableMap<String, SimpleIntegerProperty>`,
where both the change in the Mapping (e.g. addition of memes and like/dislike data) and in existing like data can be
observed by the UI.
Updates to the like and dislike count of any memes inside the currently displayed memes will be reflected on the UI.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

In the storage component, LikeData is stored under JsonSerializableStats as a map.

The following activity diagram summarizes the meme liking process:

image::MemeLikeActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how `MemeLikeCommand` communicates with `Stats` and update the like count.

image::LikeMemeSequenceDiagram.png[]

In the `CommandBox`, `UP` key is used for easy execution of `LikeCommand` and `DislikeCommand`.
This allows the user to like a meme conveniently as he/she can press the key until he/she feels like stopping.
`LEFT` and `RIGHT` keys are used for toggling the index in the complete command.
For example, when command `Like 2` is inside the command text box, where 2 is a valid index of a meme displayed,
the user can use `LEFT` arrow key to toggle it to 1, and `RIGHT` arrow key to toggle up to the maximum index.
In the case of large number of existing memes, it might be more efficient to key in the index. But for a small range,
using arrow keys to toggle between the indices will enhance the User Experience.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of LikeData.

* **Alternative 1:** Put like data as a field inside Meme object.
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: It breaks the current closed structure of Meme.
It would not make sense to add new field everytime we have some new statistics data for a meme (Like views in 2.0)
* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Separate `LikeData` as a `HashMap` and keep it in Stats.
** Pros: It isolates an additional feature (which is not essential) from Meme
and allows `Stats` features in the future to use the data easily without looking through the entire Weme.
(After a long while, when the number of memes pile up, like statistics has a O(n) growth in running time)
** Cons: Harder to implement as it involves constructing a new infrastructure.
Also, it looks somewhat out of place in `Model` as alternative 1 seems to be able to solve the problem (for now).

===== Aspect: Implementation of DislikeData.
* **Alternative 1:** Merge dislike with like and store the data as a map from String (meme url) to Observable duple.
** Pros: As dislike is just another form of like, doing this will make good use of the existing like data structure
and reduce code. It fulfils Don't Repeat Yourself principle.
** Cons: Hard to implement in v1.4 as limited time is given. Will be a refactoring point for future version (v2.0).
* **Alternative 2:** Mirror dislike from like and store it in a similar fashion.
** Pros: Simple to implement. Duplicating the existing LikeData structure and change names will guarantee to be working.
** Cons: A lot of duplicate code. Fail to fulfil DRY principle.

// end::stats[]

// tag::stats2[]

=== Statistics feature 2: Graphic display

This feature displays the statistics of the App. In the current version, it displays two types of data:
tags organized by the number of memes under them and by the like counts of the memes under them.
The graphics are embedded in the statistics panel in Weme.

==== Current Implementation

The statistics data is collated by a TagManager in the Statistics package.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

It parses the current MemeList to collate all the tags and generate either a list of `TagWithCount` or `TagWithLike`.
The `UI` passes the current `MemeList` and `Stats` interface into the panel, where the tag collation information can be
extracted in runtime.

==== Design Consideration

* **Alternative 1:** Use a TagManager class (Current implementation)
** Pros: Able to store `Tag` information for future use. Hard to morph it as the class grows bigger.
** Cons: The Manager class behaves like a Util class.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a TagUtil class
** Pros: At the moment the class behaves like a Util class, not storing any information that is being used later.
** Cons: Lack extensibility for future statistics use.

// end::stats2[]


// tag::export/import[]

=== Export/Import feature

This feature allows the user to do exporting and importing of memes using their respective staging areas as
intermediate platforms. This allows the user to both load memes into the application from their local directory,
and also export memes from the application to their local directory.

==== Export
The user may not want to export everything in the Meme storage to a directory. The Stage command
functionality introduces flexibility for the user to stage and shortlist which memes he wants to export,
which will be in the staging area under the export tab. When the user accidentally stages a meme, he can
either use the undo command or the Unstage command. When the user finally confirms the memes to be export
in the staging area, the user can execute the ExportCommand with a provided directory path. The
following sequence diagram illustrates the execution of the `Stage Command` and `Export Command`:

image::StageSequenceDiagram.png[]
image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Import
The user can use the `Load Command` to batch load all memes in the correct picture format into the import
context. However, the memes are not immediately imported to storage because there may be memes in the directory
that the user does not wish to import. Furthermore, the user may want to set descriptions and tag them before
it gets populated into the meme storage. Hence, the user is allowed to use Edit Command and Delete Command
in the import context to finalise the memes in the import context before executing the import command.
The import command will then populate all of the memes in the staging area to the memes storage, followed
by clearing the memes in the import context.

==== Current Implementation
Internally, `Weme` uses two `UniqueMemeList` to store memes that are to be imported or exported.
While the user is selecting which meme to stage, the user should have a visual reference all the existing memes.
Hence, the `Stage Command` works in the Meme Context, and the user is able to stage by the Meme Index.
On the contrary, the unstage command is only available in the export tab, where the user can reference which
memes to delete using the index in the export tab.

The following diagram shows how the commands interact with the observable lists:

image::ImportExportObjectDiagram.png[]

Step 1. The user enters the import tab

Step 2. The user executes LoadCommand and provide a directory path.
Weme will find files which are in valid format (e.g. png) and create a new memes
based on the given file path. The memes will be added into the import tab which is visible to the user.

Step 3. The user executes edit 1 d/Description t/newly added meme to edit the
description and tag of the newly added meme based on its index in the import area.
This change will also be reflected visually.

Step 4. User executes import, and weme will transfer the memes from the import list into
the memeList, which is now viewable in the meme tab. The memes in the import tab are cleared
so that the user can continue importing the memes in a new directory.

The following activity diagram summaries the load and import process:

image::ImportActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Tab for Export and Import feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate import and export into two different tabs.
** Pros: Shows clear segregation of the two different feature since they are implemented
differently. This will not confuse the user.
** Cons: Extra tab is required.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a storage tab to represent both import and export. User can toggle between
import and export using subcontext.
** Pros: Only one tab is used and also `storage` label captures the concept of import and export.
** Cons: Easily confuses the user due to extra complexity involved (subcontext). This will also cause
navigating between import and export mode to be less subtle.

===== Aspect: Ensure consistency in staging area
The memes that are being staged should be the same meme as that in the meme list at all times.
The issue comes when the user tries to clear the meme list, delete or edit a meme while the meme
is being staged.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User should receive a validation error message when an attempt
to edit or delete the meme is being made while it is being staged,
followed by a prompter to unstage the meme first.
** Pros: It makes the user aware of the fact that the meme that is going to be exported/imported
is going to be deleted/edited, or that the meme list is going to be cleared. This also
acts as a safety measure in case the user forgets to export before doing any modifications to the meme.
** Cons: More steps required for the user. The user has to unstage the meme first before making any amendments.

* **Alternative 2:** Changes in the memes tab automatically updates the export tab.
** Pros: User types in less command since everything is done automatically (i.e. updating the meme
will also update it in the staging area).
** Cons: The user may not be aware that a staged meme is being edited and deleted. The user could
possibly be confused that a staged meme is missing because it is deleted in the meme list, or that it
has been edited.

=== Command Suggestion Feature
Users can be forgetful about the command format and sometimes unsure of what arguments to supply.
Auto-suggestion of command arguments while the user keys in inputs can be very helpful to provide user hints.
Possible command words will be suggested to user based on incomplete input.
Depending on what the user has typed in for the argument, the most similar argument values retrieved from the historical
records will be displayed to the user for reference.
The user can also use the "TAB" key to auto complete the command word/argument, where the first prompt will
replace the current command word/argument in user input.

==== Current Implementation
The command suggestion is achieved using a package of prompter files.
For each parser, there will a corresponding prompter to process the current user input and return the `CommandPrompt` for display in `ResultBox`.
The following class diagram summarizes the Prompter package in the Logic.

.Partial Class Diagram of the Logic Component related Prompter package
image::CommandPromptClassDiagram.png[]

The following Sequence Diagram summarizes the how a `CommandPrompt` is generated:

image::CommandPromptSequenceDiagram.png[]

Here is how a user interact with the command suggestion features:

Step 1. The user types commands into the `CommandBox`.

Step 2. The `MainWindow` listens to changes in the content in `CommandBox` and direct the input to `WemePrompter`.

Step 3. Depending on the context, the prompter that implements `WemePrompter` (e.g. `MemePrompter`) will then pass the arguments

to different `Prompter` (e.g. `MemeAddCommandPrompter`) based on the command word.

Step 4. The `Prompter` will process the input and return a `CommandPrompt` containing the command suggestion, and the

complete text for auto-completion for the given input.

Step 5. The prompt will be passed to and displayed by `ResultBox`.

Step 6. The `CommandBox` listens to the "TAB" key press, and replace the current argument with the first command prompt.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes the command suggestion process:

image::CommandPromptActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to process the input and produce the command prompt

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a prompter package to abstract out the prompter for each command.
** Pros: Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns are achieved and coupling is reduced.
** Cons: Additional layer of abstraction and longer code.
* **Alternative 2:** Add one more method in each parser.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: The class that processses input will depend on `Parser`.

===== Aspect: How to store and access historical records.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a separate `Records` storage file to store all the historical arguments.
** Pros: Better abstraction and the records has the option to persist even if the file is deleted.
** Cons: More files to store and longer code.
* **Alternative 2:** Store arguments of a resource (e.g. `Meme`) as a field of the resource.
** Pros: Easier to implement and cleaner.
** Cons: Irrelevant information needs to be stored as a field (e.g. original file path of a resource).

// end::command-suggestion[]

// tag::tabs[]
=== Tabs feature

Most features in Weme can be logically grouped together.
For example, commands that list, view, add, edit, or delete templates all deal with templates and can fall under a single group.
As such, it seems logical for us to separate distinct groups of features at the UI level to make it more intuitive to the user.
We achieve this by putting each group of features into a tab.

==== Current implementation

As discussed earlier, `ModelManager` stores `ModelContext` which keeps track of the current context Weme is in.
Within each context, Weme exposes different commands and has different behaviors.

Tabs can be roughly seen as the reflection of `ModelContext` at the UI level.
Besides having different commands and behaviours, each tab also has its own UI components.
For example, when the `ModelContext` changes from `Memes` to `Templates`, the UI should switch from the *Memes* tab to the *Templates* tab.

Shown below are the tabs and their associated `ModelContext`s.

* *Memes* tab
** Memes (meme management)

.Screenshot of Weme in the *Memes* tab
image:MemesTabScreenshot.png[]

* *Templates* tab
** Templates (template management)
* *Create* tab
** Meme creation. Displays placeholder text if no creation session is going on.

.Screenshot of Weme in the *Create* tab
image:CreateTabScreenshot.png[]

* *Statistics* tab
** Statistics (showing Weme statistics)
* *Import* tab
** Import (for importing `Meme`s and `Templates`)
* *Export* tab
** Export (for exporting `Meme`s and `Templates`)
* *Preferences* tab
** Preferences (showing current user preferences)

`ModelContext`,

* is stored in `ModelManager` as a `SimpleObjectProperty`.
* can be changed by `Comamnd` execution.
* is exposed in `Logic` as an `ObservableValue`
* is observed by `MainWindow` to update the UI.

The user can switch tabs with `tab xyz` command, where `xyz` is the tab the user would like to switch to.

The class diagram below shows the relationship between `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` with regard to `ModelContext`.

image:ModelContextClassDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram below summarizes what happens when the user switches tabs.

image::TabSwitchSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to switch tabs

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use commands to switch tabs.
** Pros: Keyboard friendly.
** Cons: New users who have not read the user guide might not know the command syntax.
* **Alternative 2:** Use mouse to click on tab buttons.
** Pros: More intuitive for new users.
** Cons: Users who prefer a keyboard-driven workflow might not want to use the mouse.

// end::tabs[]

=== Archives Feature
Archives are an important part of resource management. While users typically enjoy seeing all their memes in one place, some might want to hide some memes, but still keep them in their collection. The archives are the solution to this problem. Users may archive memes they have grown tired of, or even templates they have found a newer version of. It is a way of hiding memes and templates from their default view to reduce clutter.

==== Current Implementation
Both `Meme` and `Template` implement the `Archivable` interface. The `Archivable` interface has one method, `isArchived`. This forces the implementing class to have an `isArchived` boolean field to indicate its current archival status. When archiving an existing `Meme` or `Template`, just like edit, the `archive` command creates a new object but with `isArchived` set to true. While it is possible to archive archived memes, there is no change and it is more likely to be a mistake, hence a `CommandException` is thrown instead. The same applies for `unarchive`.

Since the default view should show all memes/templates that are unarchived, the predicates for the individual filtered lists have to be changed accordingly. The default predicate filters the UniqueLists for the memes/templates where `isArchived` is false, and the opposite is done for the archives predicate.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Making resources archivable
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement from an `Archivable` interface
** Pros: Allows for more flexibility when extending the functionality of implementing classes.
** Cons: Some code repetition (Cannot declare instance fields or define the implementing methods).
* **Alternative 2:** Extend a `ArchivableResource` abstract class
** Pros: Less code repetition.
** Cons: Less flexibility in the future. If new types of resouces are considered in the future where Meme and Template have to extend, this implementation becomes technical debt.

// tag::view[]

=== [Miscellaneous] View feature

This feature allows the user to view a meme as an enlarged picture. This also allows
for long descriptions to be seen.

image::ViewClassDiagram.png[]

Using the above class diagram as a reference, VersionedWeme has a SimpleObjectProperty<Meme> attribute
(initially contains a null meme) which sets the Meme for the ViewPanel to view. The Meme is retrieved
as an ObservableValue<Meme> object in the model by MainWindow, which is
passed into the ViewPanel to set the meme to display.

The meme is viewed by using the ViewCommand in the memes context. The execution of the command firstly
sets the meme to view based on the given index which is picked up by the listener which sets
the meme details in the ViewPanel. Subsequently, the model context is set to the view context
which switches the MemeGridPanel to ViewPanel, hence displaying the meme.

// end::view[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::screentime[]
=== [Proposed] Screen Time

Meme can lightens up a person's mood; yet it could also make people addicted to it.
The application cannot force the user not to use it beyond a certain duration, but instead could help
by reminding the user how much time has elapsed and, by doing so, helping the user to better manage his/her time.

The screen time of the Application can be recorded in statistics data and can be captured using Java LocalDateTime.
When the user opens the application the next time, a new login time is captured in the model object
in order to compute the screen time.
Upon exiting the Application, a new logout time is recorded inside the data file, together with the screen time in the
current use. It could be a simple `Current Screen Time` = `Logout Time` - `Login Time`, which can be added to the
cumulative screen time in the data file for future reference.

A reminder can be implemented through JavaFX GUI, which listens to the current time flow and issue reminder
upon excessive use of the application. This is to prevent overuse of the application beyond leisure entertainment.

The statistics infrastructure is built with extensibility in mind. Logout time can be store in the similar manner
as like data in Jackson file, and can be stored `Stats`. `Stats Panel` is already set up to display any kinds of
statistics visuals, including this one. Hence, implementing screen time would be similar to like data, but simpler.

// end::screentime[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
