    "description": "How does our day-to-day actions and living habits affect our environment? How effectively can we engage the public, government and other stakeholders to shape a sustainable environment for humanity? Students will analyze these questions from a systems perspective by developing qualitative and quantitative models that can map the interconnections and interdependencies between stakeholders involved in current sustainability challenges facing humanity (examples: energy consumption, zero waste and recycling). In this module, students will not only develop a good understanding on sustainability challenges, but also on how actions of individuals can add up to cause such challenges.",
