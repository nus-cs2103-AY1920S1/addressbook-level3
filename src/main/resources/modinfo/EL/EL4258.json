    "description": "Metapragmatics is the study of the reflexive character of language, or how language use that refers back to language use serves as a crucial foundation for the constitution of language. As an advanced introduction to the field of metapragmatics, this module offers students key tools for metapragmatic analysis and an understanding of the significance of language ideology for the investigation of linguistic phenomena. Through discussion of classical and current research on language ideology, it explores how metapragmatics shapes language structure and use and serves as the basis for the politics of language in everyday life.",
