    "description": "This course looks mainly at contract law but also at some issues of commercial law in civil law jurisdictions in Asia using as examples a few Asian civil and commercial codes (for example the Indonesian codes which are similar to the French codes). It also looks at civil law in general as, unfortunately, more materials are available in English on European civil law than on Asian civil law. The course is comparative in nature as it will compare civil and common law solutions. It would be a useful course for those who will works for firms with dealings across Asia.",
