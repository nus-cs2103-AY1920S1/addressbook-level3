    "description": "This seminar will study \"one by one\" the famous Essais by Michel de Montaigne, who first coined the term \"essay\" and popularized this form as a literary genre. Montaigne was a statesman as well as a celebrated thinker and scholar, and his writings have been much admired for their intellectual range, their nuance and originality, and especially their warmth and humanity. Donald Frame's highly readable translation is considered one of the most successful examples of translation ever.",
