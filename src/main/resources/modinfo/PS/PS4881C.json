    "description": "This seminar considers working class participation in the political economy, including labour market regulation, national labour administration, state-labour ties, labour-business relations, the structural conditions underpinning labour-capital relations and labour representation in the political arena. Attention is given to corporatist, neo-corporatist and pluralist forms of labour politics and to some of the ways labour enters the political system: for example, as autonomous, state or party-dependent, nondependent party-affiliated, pressure group, social movement or unorganized activity. Issues of format, scope, and participation in collective bargaining will be addressed, as will principal-agent and other collective action logics.",
