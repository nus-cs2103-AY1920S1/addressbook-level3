    "description": "Financial markets\u2019 meltdown, climate change, and cyber-threats are only some of the global problems that states cannot manage alone. All require cooperation among governments and increasingly with their citizens and the private sector; some need international norms and mechanisms; others call for international and regional organizations. This course provides an introduction to the evolving architecture, processes, and norms of global governance. It then provides an in-depth analysis of the actors, norms, and challenges in the supply of some of today\u2019s critical global public goods, including financial stability, economic development, trade, climate change mitigation, global health, and a secure cyberspace.",
