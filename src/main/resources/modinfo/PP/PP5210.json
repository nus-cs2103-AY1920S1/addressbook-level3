    "description": "The module will provide students with a thorough understanding of the structures underpinning contemporary global governance. This will include detailed study of the multilateral institutions, in particular of the UN and the WTO, that provide its principal bulwark. The manner in which key global players pursue their perceived national interests within these institutions would be examined. The \u2018rise of Asia\u2019 against the matrix of changing global power relations, and the accommodation of re-emerging China and India would be analyzed. The role of small powers and their contribution to shaping global values and actions would be studied. All along, public policy perspectives and angles would be emphasized.",
