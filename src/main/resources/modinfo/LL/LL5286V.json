    "description": "While terrorism is not a new phenomenon, the sheer scale and transnational nature of that practice in recent years have challenged some of the core tenets of international law. This seminar investigates the role that international law can play, along with its shortcomings, in suppressing and preventing terrorism. It examines the manner in which terrorism and counterterrorism laws and policies have affected the scope and application of diverse international legal regimes including UN collective security, inter-State use of force, the law of international responsibility, international human rights, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law.",
