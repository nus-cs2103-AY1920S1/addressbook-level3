    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for the BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, wind and percussion. Normally undertaken in the second year of study, this module usually follows the completion of Advanced Jury Performance and acts as a preparatory period for the student\u2019s Junior Recital. Students should be finding a clearer focus in relation to their future artistic and professional direction, with dimensions of the studies undertaken beginning to include evolving capacities in self-promotion and production, the exploration of summer programmes, and critical reflection on their relative progression and trajectory within the specific instrumental field.",
