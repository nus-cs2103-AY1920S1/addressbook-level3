    "description": "Aimed at developing a critical perspective on the nature and practice of modern geography, this module situates the development of geography within the wider context of philosophical and social change. It examines the basic nature of the discipline by considering some of the ways in which the relationship between society and space has been theorised within geography. One component explores the development of environmental scientific thought and practice and related philosophical issues. A second component evaluates the different paradigms, approaches and methodological considerations which have influenced human geography including the impact of positivism, humanism, Marxism, feminism, realism and postmodernism. Some attention is also given to new approaches to narrating the history of geography alongside the more conventional forms of historiography theory critique.",
