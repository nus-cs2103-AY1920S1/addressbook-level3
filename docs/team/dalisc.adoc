== 1. Introduction

=== 1.1. About the Project

Mortago, a desktop application, is a comprehensive mortuary management system. It is a student project from the National University of Singapore (NUS). Mortago is a portmanteau of two Latin words: "mortem" (death) and "curago" (to manage). As its name suggests, Mortago aims to streamline mortuary processes such as updating statuses, keeping track of unclaimed bodies, and generating reports for hospital mortuary managers. The user interacts with MORTAGO using a command line interface (CLI), and it displays a dashboard (Figure 1) that shows bodies, workers and fridges entries.

The interface is responsive to suit different screen sizes. However, due to its detailed interface, it is recommended for larger screen sizes such as desktop monitors. Mortago has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and maintains a local storage.

The image below shows where the users can type the commands and where the details are displayed:

=== 1.2. About the Team

This project was undertaken by a team of five Year 2 computer science undergraduates, including myself, as part of the NUS module CS2103T Software Engineering. For most of us, it was our first time being part of a small-scale software development team. We were tasked to build the application under the contraints that it must be CLI and targets a small user base.

=== 1.3. About My Role

My role was to design the `stats`, `filter`, and `find` features. The following section elaborates on my work in greater detail. Other than engineering these features, I also contributed to the project documentation (user and developer guides). I will be including excerpts of these contributions in the next section.

Before we move there, I would like to highlight the symbols and text formatting that will be used in this document. A grey highlight like `stats` indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application. Three earlier examples can be seen in this section.

== 2. Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

* *Major enhancement 1*: I added the line chart display which shows admissions statistics.
** What it does: The line chart displays the number of bodies admitted to the mortuary daily over the last ten days. This is the default view. With the `stats` command, users can toggle between a ten-day, weekly, monthly, or yearly display. Furthermore, any particular week, month, or year can be specified.
** Justification: It is important for users to know how many bodies are admitted daily as well as the trends for admission. As managers of the mortuary, they can make staffing decisions on various times of the year depending on the trends.
** Highlights: This feature can be further enhanced by adding more data to the display, for example, another line for bodies claimed daily which can show the average lag time between admission and claim dates.
** Credits: Support for rendering the line chart was provided by JavaFX.

* *Major enhancement 1*: I added the ability to filter entries.
** What it does: The `filter` command allows users to filter body or worker entries by any attributes,
** Justification: This is a necessary feature for a system that intends to manage a lot of data. Sometimes, mortuary managers just need to view entries of a specific kind. They can filter entries by sex, status, cause of death, etc.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added the ability to find workers or bodies by their name.
** Justification: Although the previous command can serve the same purpose, the `find` command is useful for when the user has a specific entry in mind that they want to view as it is a shorter and more efficient command.

*** I made instructional diagrams for every teammate's sections that needed such diagrams. (Pull request: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/pull/263[#263])
** Community:
*** I reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (Examples:  https://github.com/dalisc/ped/issues/10[1], https://github.com/dalisc/ped/issues/8[2], https://github.com/dalisc/ped/issues/11[3])

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide
We wrote a User Guide targeted at the users of Mortago. The User Guide containts instructions on how to use the various commands of the application. The following is an excerpt from our Mortago User Guide, showing additions that I have
made for the `stats` and `filter`features.

_{start of extract 1: stats command}_
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=stats]
_{end of extract 1}_

_{start of extract 2: filter command}_
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=filter]
_{end of extract 2}_

== 4. Contributions to the Developer Guide

In addition to a User Guide, we wrote a Developer Guide targeted at developers who are interested in contributing to the project. The Developer Guide showcases my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project. Given below is my contribution to the Developer Guide:

_{start of extract 1: implementation of stats command}_
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=statistics]
_{end of extract 1}_

_{start of extract 2: manual testing of stats command}_
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=statsManualTesting]
_{end of extract 2}_

_{start of extract 3: manual testing of filter command}_
include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=filterManualTesting]
_{end of extract 3}_
