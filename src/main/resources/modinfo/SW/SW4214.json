    "description": "This module discusses how social issues are defined, social policies formulated, and value choices and theoretical models of society are adopted that govern the use of one set of policies over another. The module also examines the nexus between social policies and social services from a cross-national perspective with particular reference to selected countries in Southeast Asia. Students will be helped to analyse the challenges and constraints of a given system in the light of the socio-political and economic circumstances of specific countries. Analysis of selected social policy issues of contemporary interest to industrial and industrialising societies of Southeast Asia will be integral to the module.",
