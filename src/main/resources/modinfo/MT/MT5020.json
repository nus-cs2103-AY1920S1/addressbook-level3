    "description": "The successful management of the human aspects of technological innovation has been increasingly recognised as an essential element for project success. Building on engineering, psychology and management literatures, the aim of this module is to provide students with a theoretical understanding and a foundation for developing skills related to motivations, team work, role transition, conflict management and productivity management. As such, this module is a valuable complement to traditional engineering modules that focus much on the technical developments.",
