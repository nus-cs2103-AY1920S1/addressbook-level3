    "description": "Indicators are measured concepts that monitor development and track progress. Indicator reports are an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, providing government, researchers, business and the public with data driven evidence to inform policy, research and debate. Developing innovative indicators to monitor the progress of difficult to measure concepts (i.e. sustainability, cultural wellbeing, community cohesion), using novel techniques of data collection and analysis (experience sampling, social media, IoT monitoring), are necessities for a society to thrive in an increasingly complex world.",
