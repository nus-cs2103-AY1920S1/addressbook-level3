    "description": "This module introduces students to constraint-based lexicalist theories of syntax, which differ from mainstream generative syntax in three important ways: They are surface-oriented (no sequences of phrase structures that constitute the derivation of sentences), constraint-based (no operations that destructively modify any representations), and strongly lexicalist (lexical entries are the key elements that drive the construction of the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences). Students will come to understand the motivations for such theories and are invited to evaluate what they had previously learnt in other syntax modules vis-\u00e0-vis the contents of this module.",
