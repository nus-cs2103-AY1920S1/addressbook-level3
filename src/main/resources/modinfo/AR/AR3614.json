    "description": "What is sustainable urbanism in Asia? How is it shaped by the diverse socio-cultural and economic political configurations in Asia? This module will investigate the above questions by exploring the different paradigms of sustainable development and urbanism. This module will understand how different actors and organisations \u2013 from state agencies to corporations, from non-governmental organisations to community organisations \u2013 construct and practice sustainable urbanism through first-hand experience from site visits and field investigations. This module offers a situated interdisciplinary understanding of the complexity of sustainable urbanism in Asia. It is designed for students who are interested in both Asia and environmentalism.",
