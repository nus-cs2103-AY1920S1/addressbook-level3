    "description": "Making money is a widely accepted goal for many in various societies. This module focuses on what does it actually mean to make money, what are values in general and how can individuals, such as entrepreneurs create them in particular. Studying the close intertwinedness of economic and cultural values will lead, perhaps surprisingly, to philosophical reflections upon the meaning of life and what could constitute \u201chappiness\u201d. While acquiring some practical business skills students, draw the connection between what has been called rhetorics in the humanities and marketing, sales and negotiation in business studies. A discussion on the potential of \u201ctransformative entrepreneurship\u201d for societies will round up the semester.",
