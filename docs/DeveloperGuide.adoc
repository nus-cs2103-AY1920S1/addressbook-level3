== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Task feature
==== Description of feature
Within every project, there are tasks to be done or milestones to be achieved within certain deadlines. The diagram below shows the class diagram of the task class and how it interacts with the model.

.Class Diagram for Task

image::TaskClassDiagram.png[]

As shown above, each project stores multiple tasks in a list. These tasks can be stored, deleted, edited and sorted very easily.
Here are some task related commands that can be executed by the app.

. addTask - adds a task into the project model.
. deleteTask - removes a task from the project model based on index specified by user
. editTask - edits a task of the given index with attribute/s to edit e.g deadline/description/whether is done
. sortTask - sorts the list of tasks based on specification given by user. (more info available in section 3.3)

==== Details
As seen in figure 9, each task consists of 3 parameters namely description, time and a boolean state to show whether the task is done/in progress.
A typical task will look like this on the app: +

image::TASK.png[]

// tag::addProjectMeeting[]
=== Meeting feature
==== Description of feature
Within every project, there are meetings to be held at certain time.
The diagram below shows the class diagram of the meeting class and how it interacts with the model.

.Class Diagram for Meeting

image::MeetingClassDiagram.png[]

As shown above, each project stores multiple meetings in a list. These meetings are automatically sorted based on the time in ascending order.
Here are some meeting related commands that can be executed by the app.

. addProjectMeeting - adds a meeting into the project model.
. deleteProjectMeeting- removes a meeting from the project model based on index specified by user

==== Details
As seen in figure 10, each meeting consists of 2 parameters namely description and time to show what is the meeting about
and the date and time of the meeting respectively.
A typical meeting will look like this on the app:

image::ProjectMeeting.png[]

// end::addProjectMeeting[]

// tag::memberFeature[]
=== Member feature
==== Description of feature
In every project, it almost certain that there are members. Therefore we have allowed for the users to be able to
track who are the members, and how many members there are within each project. Each `Project` stores its members as a list
of strings representing their names, and similarly each `Person` stores the projects they are involved in
as a list of strings representing the project titles. Below you will find 2 diagrams which represents this relationship.

.Class diagram of Project
image::MemberClassDiagram1.png[picutre, 250]

.Class diagram of a Person
image::MemberClassDiagram2.png[picture, 250]

[NOTE]
Whenever member is mentioned it should be known that it is represented by a `Person`.

In order to facilitate this feature, 4 commands are implemented as a subclass of the `Command` class:

. `addMember` - Adds a new `Person` to the contacts an records the name as a member of the current working project.
. `addFromContacts` - Adds a `Person` to the current working project as a member.
. `removeMember` - Removes the record of the `Person` as a member of the current working project.
. `addProfilePicture` - Adds a profile picture to the specified `Person`.

==== Implementation

In this section, we will demonstrate how a member is added to the project from your contacts, and also how a member as a new `Person`.

We will start with adding a new `Person` to your contacts, and to your project at the same time.

Step 1. The user enters the `addMember` command with the following parameters `n/David p/94328727 e/david97@hotmail.com a/Ang Mo kio
avenue 3`.

Full user input: `addMember n/David p/94328727 e/david97@hotmail.com a/Ang Mo kio
avenue 3`

The user input is parsed into an `ArgumentMultiMap` by `AddMemberCommandParser#parse` so that every attribute of the person can be
extracted, and put into a `NewMemberDescriptor` to be used to correctly create the `Person`.

[NOTE]
`ArgumentMultimap` is a class that stores all the parsed parameters from the user input.

[NOTE]
`NewMemberDescriptor` is a class that stores any all the information on the `Person` given by the user to be used
to create the `Person` subsequently.

Step 2. The information of the person is stored in the `NewMemberDescriptor`, and used to create a new instance of the `AddMemberCommand`


Every Project keeps track of which members are involved by storing a list of strings of the names of the members.
Similarly a Person keeps track of which projects they are involved in by storing a list of strings of the project titles.

The following commands are implemented to support this feature:

. `addMember` - Adds a new person to the contacts as well as to the current working project.
. `addFromContacts` - Adds a person currently stored in your contacts to the current working project.
. `removeMember` - Removes a person from the current working project.
. `addProfilePicture` - Adds a profile picture to a person in the contacts.

// end::memberFeature[]

=== Sorting feature
==== Description of feature

Sorts some lists based on specifications provided by the user.
There are 3 lists that are able to be sorted so far. +

. Sort list of tasks
. Sort list of spending
. Sort list of meetings

The implementation is similar for these 3 methods. It makes use of `SortingOrder`, which is
a container class that stores the current sort order as well as methods to get and set these orders.
`SortingOrder` can be found in the `model` package.
Currently there are 5 different methods to sort the lists.

. Alphabetical order
. Increasing order of time
. Whether tasks are done
. Whether tasks are done and then by increasing order of time
. Increasing price

[NOTE]

Methods 3-4 are only for sorting tasks whereas method 5 is for sort spending.
Methods 1-2 can be used to sort all lists.

==== Details
All sort commands take in a single integer as parameter. As mentioned in the
note above, integers 1-4 are valid input for sortTask, integers 1, 2 and 5 are valid for sortSpending, and
integers 1-2 are valid for sortMeeting.

An example command would be `sortTask 1` which sorts the list of tasks by alphabetical order.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of obtaining a list with the new sorting order
and updating the current sort order in `SortingOrder` class.

.Sequence Diagram for sortTask
image::SortTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

These are the stages shown in figure 9. Stages are similar for sort spending as well.

. Parses the input to obtain the index.
. Goes to `SortingOrder` to change the current sorting order to the one linked to the given index based on the specification shown above.
. Obtains list of tasks from model and sorts it. List now maintains this sorting order and displays a sorted list even after adding or editing elements.
. Display the newly sorted task list.

.Activity Diagram for sortTask
image::SortTaskActivityDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows sortTask works. There are 2 possible error messages that can occur. Firstly,
if the user inputs an index that is not applicable to the type of items sorted. For example, `sortTask 5`
is invalid as index 5 is linked to a price sorting mechanism which is not applicable to sorting tasks. Secondly,
an error will be shown if the user attempts to sort the items in the same order is the current sorting order.
For example, since the default sorting order for tasks is by increasing order of date, the command `sortTask 2`
will be invalid if the sorting order has never been changed before. Otherwise if the input is valid,
the sorting will occur and the newly sorted task list will be displayed.


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the sort commands


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the data in list.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: May have performance issues as list has to be sorted every time a new element is added or edited.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the data in a PriorityQueue.
** Pros: Much more efficient in terms of performance and complexity. Internal list will automatically be updated which means
no additional sorting needed when adding or editing new elements.
** Cons: Have to create and add all the tasks into another PriorityQueue if the sorting order were to be changed. Harder to implement.


// tag::sendReminder[]
=== Sending Reminder feature
==== Description of feature

Sends reminder for tasks and meetings that are due in the number of days given by the user input.

The basic implementation uses javax.Mail to send email to other email addresses. The Mailer class has static method sendEmail
which is responsible for sending all kinds of email to a given recipient(s). User's email account information is
stored in the Model class and subsequent queries regarding mailing will use this information that has been stored to send the email.
Currently, only gmail server has been made available for use in sending the emails.

[NOTE]
User Email  Account Information is stored through the signIn command.

==== Details
SendReminder takes in a single integer as parameter. The integer will be the duration in days from the current times in which the meetings and tasks are due.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of sending reminder to the project members.

.Sequence Diagram for sendReminder
image::SendReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

These are the stages shown in figure 15.

. Parses the input to obtain the duration.
. Goes to `Model` to get the the Meetings and Tasks.
. Obtains list of tasks and meetings which are due in the duration time.
. Goes to `Project` to get the Members names.
. Goes to `Model` to get the members in the project.
. Goes to `Model` to get the OwnerAccount information.
. Sends email to all the members about the upcoming meetings and tasks in the project.
. Display the success message.

.Activity Diagram for sendReminder
image::SendReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how `sendReminder` works. There are 2 possible error messages for invalid input. Firstly,
if the user inputs nothing as the duration and input cannot be empty error message is shown. Secondly,
an error will be shown if the user non-numeric or negative or zero number as the duration of time. For a valid input,
user will be required to checkout then signIn first before executing the command.


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the sendReminder commands

* **Alternative 1:** Storing List<Person> in the Project for members.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Do not need to look for the person object in the addressBook from the List of String of
members' names in the project.
** Cons: Introduces coupling and may cause unwanted bugs due to cyclic dependencies as Project contains Person and
Person contains Project.
* **Alternative 2:** Stores members as List<String> of members names.
** Pros: Reduces coupling and and eliminates cyclic dependencies between Project and Person object..
** Cons: Have to hash the members object in the addressBook by names and go through the List<String> of members'
names one by one to get the Person object of the member. Harder to implement.

// end::sendReminder[]


// tag::broadcastMail[]
=== Broadcast Mail feature
==== Description of feature

Broadcast an email to all members in the project.

Similar to sendReminder, the basic implementation uses javax.Mail to send email to other email addresses. The Mailer class has static method sendEmail
which is responsible for sending all kinds of email to a given recipient(s). User's email account information is
stored in the Model class and subsequent queries regarding mailing will use this information that has been stored to send the email.
Currently, only gmail server has been made available for use in sending the emails.

[NOTE]
User Email  Account Information is stored through the signIn command.

==== Details
BroadcastMail takes in a two String, an email Subject and Body.
The subject will be the email title which are normally on the email header and the body
will be the message body of the email.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of broadcast email to the project members.

.Sequence Diagram for broadcastMail
image::BroadcastMailSequenceDiagram.png[]

These are the stages shown in figure 15.

. Parses the input to obtain the Subject and Body of the email.
. Goes to `Project` to get the Members names.
. Goes to `Model` to get the the members in the project.
. Goes to `Model` to get the OwnerAccount information.
. Sends email to all the members with header Subject and message Body.
. Display the success message.

.Activity Diagram for BroadcastMail
image::BroadcastMailActivityDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how `broadcastMail` works.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the broadcastMail commands

The alternatives are similar to sendReminder as the underlying problem lies in sending email
to all the members in the project group.
// end::broadcastMail[]

// tag::signIn[]
=== Sign In feature
==== Description of feature

Signs in using a Google account for mailing purposes.

The basic implementation uses javax.Mail to check for the validity of the email address and password.
User's email account information is stored in the Model class through this command.

[NOTE]
In this version, only gmail server has been made available for use in signing in and sending emails.

==== Details
signIn takes in two inputs, first is the email address of the user (in gmail), second is the password to the email address.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of signing in to the user's account.

.Sequence Diagram for signIn command
image::SignInSequenceDiagram.png[]

These are the stages shown in figure 15.

. Parses the input to obtain the Email address and Password.
. Goes to `Model` to check if user has signed in.
. Creates OwnerAccount with the address and password.
. Goes to `Model` to store the Email address and Password as `OwnerAccount`.
. Display the success message.

.Activity Diagram for SignIn
image::SignInActivityDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how `signIn` works.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Algorithm to check validity of the Account in SignIn commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sends an email to a dummy email address cs2103t17@gmail.com.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Do not need to use external libraries which might be time-consuming and difficult to learn.
** Cons: Takes a while for the method to be executed as it checks whether it can send an email to the address cs2103t17@gmail.com.
* **Alternative 2:** Use external libraries and utilise more of the javax.Mail API.
** Pros: Might make the email checking more efficient, thus need only check for the password input.
** Cons: Would have to use external libraries which will be harder to implement. Only checks for the existence of the email address and does not
check for the correctness of the password input.

===== Aspect: Eliminating signIn command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lets user Signs In using their own Gmail Account.
** Pros: Allows users to user their own Gmail Account and lets members(recipients) know email
sent by the team leaders.
** Cons: Expose users' password when users are trying to sign in. Users will need to change the account
security settings to let less secure app access the account. Compromises account security.
* **Alternative 2:** Hardcode an account in the application that is responsible for all mailing command.
** Pros: Do not expose users' password and Users do not need to change their Account security settings to
send the emails.
** Cons: Members(recipient) receiving email from the users' may not know the origin of the email.
This may lead to confusion for the project's members.
// end::signIn[]

// tag::setTimetable[]

=== Timetable input
==== Description of Feature
This feature is used to input timetable data, which would then be used in the `generate` command to find a suitable meeting timeslot.

There are two ways to input member's timetable:

. Member send a formatted text file to the team leader, which would then be parsed by the system. The file would be a list of newline separated time ranges
. Member send their NUSMods timetable URL to the team leader, and the system would parse the URL and fetch timetable data using NUSMods API

User command would be in the format: `setTimetable INDEX m/member [n/NUSMODS_URL] [f/FILEPATH]`

The main logic is implemented within the `TimetableInput` class, which is invoked by the `SetTimetableCommand` class.

==== Details

Important functions in `TimetableInput`:

* `TimetableInput#getTimetableFromNUSMods(Url url)` -- Parse URL and fetch timetable data using NUSMods API
* `TimetableInput#getTimetableFromFile(String filepath)` -- Parse file to obtain timetable data

Below is an overview of the classes related to time+table input:

.Class diagram for timetable input feature
image::set-timetable/SetTimetableClassDiagram.png[]

`setTimetableCommand` accepts either a filepath or a URL, which is then supplied to `TimetableInput` to fetch the timetable data.

Afterwards, the timetable is passed into `TimetableVisualization` to provide a visual representation of the set timetable. This visualization is then passed back as a `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens when the user issues the command `setTimetable` to add their timetable from a shared NUSMods timetable.

.Timeline of entire process from user executing their command to getting the result back.
image::set-timetable/SetTimetableSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to input timetable

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Input timetable by importing timetable from an already existing platform.
** Pros: More practical and convenient for users to input, as opposed to manually typing in all the timetable for every single members.
** Cons: Feature unreliable as it requires maintainance if the web API changes.
* **Alternative 2:** Input all time ranges manually by user.
** Pros: Very reliable due to lack of usage of online APIs.
** Cons: Very impractical. Most users would not want to enter timetable data of all their members one by one, and would probably skip this feature.

We realized that it is very impractical to expect users to input timetable manually all by themselves. No matter how unreliable the web API is, the feature would at least be useful to users. If users have to manually input all the data, we cannot realistically expect this feature to be useful at all.

// end::setTimetable[]

// tag::generate[]
=== Generate meeting timeslot
==== Description of Feature

The timeslot generator is used to suggest meeting timings by making use of team members' timetable.

[NOTE]
This feature makes heavy use of the class `TimeRange`, which represents a period of time in a week, e.g. MONDAY 1000 -- MONDAY 1200.

The main logic of this feature is contained within the `TimeSlotGenerator` class:

==== Details

`TimeSlotGenerator(members, desiredMeetingDuration, restrictedTimeRange)`

* `members`: `List<Timetable>` of members of the checked-out `Project`
* `desiredMeetingDuration`: How long the meeting would last in hour, expressed as a positive integer
* `restrictedTimeRange`: Sets the limit of generated `TimeRange`, e.g. restrict meeting to working hours, from MONDAY 0900 - MONDAY 1800

Only the two following methods are exposed:

* `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` -- Generate timeslot suitable for *_all_* `Timetable` supplied. Returns a list of `TimeRange`, or an empty list of `TimeRange` if no such timeslot is available.
* `TimeSlotGenerator#generateWithMostMembers()` -- Generate timeslot where *_most_* members of the currently checked out project are available. Returns a list of `TimeRange`.


This feature depends on the timetable stored internally as an attribute of each members:

.Class diagram of the `TimeSlotGenerator`
image::GenerateSlotClassDiagram.png[]

Typical usage of `TimeSlotGenerator` would be look like this:

`List<TimeRange> availableTimeSlots = new TimeSlotGenerator(members, desiredMeetingDuration, restrictedTimeRange).generate()`

The following sequence diagram shows the entire process of generating timeslot after the command `generate d/2` is given:

.Timeline of process from user entering the command to the results being displayed to the user.
image::GenerateSlotSequenceDiagram.png[]

As shown in the sequence diagram above, the command execution would go through the following stages:

. Fetch the data of members in the current project and pass them to the `TimeSlotGenerator`.
. `TimeSlotGenerator` will extract their timetable and generate all possible `TimeRange`.
. Display result for the user to view all the possible timeslots that a meeting can be held.

[NOTE]
If `generate()` returns an empty `List<TimeRange>`, the program should automatically call `generateWithMostMembers()` and return it as result, informing the user that there is no timeslot where all members are available.

The following activity diagram summarizes the general flow of the command `generate`:

.`generate` command tries to provide best possible meeting timeslot
image::GenerateSlotActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Algorithm Used

===== `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()`

. Combine all the given `Timetable` into a single `List<TimeRange> combined`
. `combined` is then processed further by merging overlapping `TimeRange` into a single `TimeRange`. E.g. `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1000, MONDAY, 1200)` and `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1200, MONDAY,1400)` are merged together to form a single `TimeRange(MONDAY, 1000, MONDAY, 1400)`. `List<TimeRange> merged` is then passed on to the next stage.
. `merged` is then inverted, and returns `List<TimeRange> inverted` containing all timeslots where all the members are free.
. `inverted` is then processed to ensure that all `TimeRange` falls within `restrictedTimeRange` specified by the user, truncating all `TimeRange` that extends beyond the specified `restrictedTimeRange`, returning `List<TimeRange> truncated`.
. The algorithm then filters `inverted` by rejecting all `TimeRange` that last shorter than `desiredMeetingDuration` specified by the user. This `List<TimeRange> accepted` is then passed back to the caller of this method, and the algorithm terminates.

===== `TimeSlotGenerator#generateWithMostMembers()`

. Iterates over all possible combinations of timetables in descending order of number of timetable.
. For each possible combination, call `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()`.
. If `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` returns an empty list, repeat step 2 again.
. Algorithm terminates, returning the combination of List<Timetable> used and available timings `List<TimeRange>` wrapped in a class `TimeSlotWithMember`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to generate timeslot with most number of available members

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate over all possible combinations of timetables, sorted in descending order of number of timetables, and call `TimeSlotGenerator#generate()` on each of these combinations.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed. This implementation takes O(2^n^) time for _n_  members.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a more sophisticated algorithm to shorten generation duration
** Pros: Will be much more efficient
** Cons: Harder to implement, and more specialize towards only doing a single task. Tough to maintain and adapt for other usage.

We went with options 1 as there is no real difference in speed if the number of members is restricted to below 15 members, which many projects do not normally exceed. It is much easier to understand and maintain by other developers as well.

// end::generate[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Finance feature

The finance feature allows the user to keep track of the budgets of
the project and view them in a graph. The graphs are achieved
using JavaFX built in bar and pie chart. The user is also able to store
the information in an excel sheet as well. This is done using
the Apache POI API. The documentation of this library can
be seen at https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/[here].

==== Details

This logic of the feature is based on the the construction of different classes.

.This class diagram depicts the interaction among classes under finance feature.
image::FinanceClassDiagram.png[]

The fact that `Budget` contains two money object is that it maintains
two attribute `amount` and `remainingAmount` as these are usually
the crucial information the user wants to see.

==== Design considerations
`Money` is represented as an object. As it is shared by the
`Spending` class and the `Budget` class and they all require to
check the validity of a given string to convert it to `BigDecimal`.


[[Implementation-Checkout]]
=== Checkout
This allows user to checkout to a project from a list of project to work on it.
Almost every command regarding the project require the user to checkout first.

How it works is the ModelManager class is holding an additional `Optional<Project>` 
attribute and the model supports three new methods:

* `setWorkingProject()` -- Sets the attribute to the argument of the method.
* `getWorkingProject()` -- Returns the current project.
* `isCheckedOut()` -- Checks whether the current working project is empty.

A typical use of the command can be seen in the sequence diagram below.

image::CheckoutSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Implementation-Change-in-UI-display]]
=== Change in UI display
The first step of changing UI display is to find out
whether a change in UI is needed given a command from user.
This is done in the CommandResult class constructor. If a command
word matches actions that is email related or help or exit,
the flag will indicate that a change in UI is not needed.

Next, a class to represent a state of UI is needed to remember
a history which is the `UiEvent` class.UiEvent is a class that represent
a type of UiDisplay as an event. It stores the current state of the
application's UI and the current working project if it exists.
Whenever a command is executed, only if this command lead to a state
that is different from the current one a new UiEvent will be generated and stored in history.
The `viewHistory` is stored in the `MainWindow` class as a stack of UiEvents
and it also maintains a currentStatePointer. When a `back` command
is executed, it can check back on what is the previous state.

* `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` -- Change the Ui and change the current state.
* `MainWindow#getPreviousState` -- Pops the stack and peek to look for the previous state.
* `MainWindow#handleBack` -- Change the Ui display to the previous state.

Given below is an example of how the UI behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `viewHistory` will be initialized with the initial
`PROJECT_LIST` state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to
that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `checkout 1` command to checkout to preoject 1 to work on.
During the execution of the `checkout` command, at the commandresult generation step,
it detects that there is a need to change the Ui and the flag is made to true.
In the `MainWindow`, since a change is needed, `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` is called
to change the display and set the `currentState` to be `PROJECT_OVERVIEW`.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState1.png[]

Step 3. The user now decide to add a budget by `addBudget b/ equipment 3000.00`.
This command does need a change in Ui display but the state of this command
is exactly the same as the previous command thus `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay`
will be called with the same state.
Thus, the method `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` is still called but this time
it is called to update the information in the current display and set the
current state to be still the current state. Thus, the `currentStatePointer` does
not move.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, a `commandResult` wont be generated thus no change in Ui will happen.

Step 4. The user now wants to have a better view of the budgets and executes
`listBudget`. Same step follows through the checkout command.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState3.png[]

Step 5. The user now decides to go back to the home page and executes
two consecutive `back` command. At the execute stage in `MainWindow`,
it detects it is a back command and `MainWindow#handleBack` is called.
This method will then pop the current state by `MainWindow#getPreviousState`
and call `MainWindow#changeUiDisplay` to display the previous Ui.

image::ChangeUiDisplayState5.png[]

.This diagram shows how the Ui reacts to an user's input
image::ChangeUiDisplayActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at `PROJECT_LIST`, then there are
no previous UI states to go back. Under such situation, an error will be returned.

// tag::performanceTracking[]
=== Performance Tracking

We allow users to be able to track the performance of every member in the project, by using information that the user has
already input into MyProject.

==== Implementation

The `Performance` of each `Person` is consolidated and stored in a `PerformanceOverview` object inside the model.

[NOTE]
`Performance` of a `Person` stores the information such as tasks assigned to the person, which are specific to the person. The actual performance
of the person can only be calculated in `PerformanceOverview` with information from the `Project` as well.

`PerformanceOverview` is a separate model we have implemented, which consolidates all the data from each `Person` involved
in the specific project, as well as from the project itself. The following is a class diagram for `PerformanceOverview`.

image::PerformanceOverviewClassDiagram.png[picture,250]

A typical `PerformanceOverview` is created using the following constructor:

`PerformanceOverview(project, memberList)`

* `project` - This is the `Project` that the user is concerned about.

* `memberList` - This is the `List<Person>` which consists of all the `Person`(s) involved with this project. Note that they each
have their own `Performance` as well.

All the calculations of the various components constituting the performance of an individual is calculated within the `PerformanceOverview`,
and the results are accessed using each of the following commands:

. `PerformanceOverview#getAttendanceOf(Person person)` - Gets the number of meetings attended by the `Person`
. `PerformanceOverview#getRateOfAttendanceOf(Person person)` - Gets the percentage of meetings attended by the `Person`
. `PerformanceOverview#getNumOfTaskDoneOf(Person person)` - Gets the number of tasks completed by this `Person`
. `PerformanceOverview#getTaskCompletionRateOf(Person person)` - Gets the percentage of the assigned tasks, which the `Person` completed

Internally, every attribute of the performance of an individual a HashMap for that particular attribute. For example, the task completion
rate of every individual is stored in a `HashMap<String, RateOfTaskCompletion>` where the key is the string of the name of the member, while
the value is the rate of task completion. Every other attribute is stored in similar fashion.

Next, we will demonstrate the process of using this feature to see the performance of each member. The following sequence diagram
shows the entire process of calculating the performance of member and showing it, after the `showPerformanceOverview` command
is input by the user.

.Sequence diagram of the `showPerformanceOverview` command execution
image::ShowPerformanceOverviewSequenceDiagram.png[]

With reference to the sequence diagram above, here are the steps of the command execution:

Step 1. The user input is parsed, and a `ShowPerformanceOverviewCommand` is created.

Step 2. The execution of the `ShowPerformanceOverviewCommand` fetches the `Project` that the user is working on, and also
the `Person`(s) involved in the project and returns them as a `List<Person>`.

Step 3. The `List<Person>` and `Project` are used to create the `PerformanceOverview`. Here you can see that when a `PerformanceOverview` is created
there are 4 methods being called internally. This is where all the necessary information is taken from the project and members, and used to
calculate the different attributes of the member's performance. It is also in those 4 methods, where the HashMaps are created.

Step 4. The `PerformanceOverview` is set in the `Model`, and displayed to the user subsequently.

The following activity diagram summarizes the general flow of the execution of the `showPerformanceOverview` command:

.Activity diagram for `showPerformanceOverview`
image::ShowPerformanceOverviewActivityDiagram.png[picture, 400]

As shown in the activity diagram, there are only 2 main flows during the execution of this command. If there are members
in the project, the performance of the members can be calculated, and the performance overview will be displayed
to the user. If there are no members in the project, the user will be shown an error message to tell them that
the performance overview cannot be computed.

==== Design Considerations
**Data structure of `PerformanceOverview`**

* **Alternative 1(Current implementation):** Currently, every attribute is stored and paired to the member using a HashMap. The key
is the string representation of the name of the members, and the value is the attribute itself.

** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
*** In order to add a new attribute to measure performance, there is only a need to add a new HashMap, a method to calculate the values,
and a method to retrieve the values.

** Cons:
*** It is more difficult to iterate through all HashMaps to retrieve the values based on your preferred ordering.
