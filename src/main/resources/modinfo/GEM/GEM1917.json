The science behind global change (climate variability and change, natural weather disasters such as floods and droughts, environmental degradation); human aspects of change (water crises and conflict, agriculture and food security, energy sustainability, climate, health); and technology and policy issues relating to mitigation and adaptation (renewable energy, carbon trading, water resource engineering, agricultural development) will be covered.",
