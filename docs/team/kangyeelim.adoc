== Introduction

This project portfolio briefly introduces the project, treasurerPro and outlines my contributions to the project
and showcases the key features I implemented.

=== About the Team

My team of five members consists of four Year 2 Computer Science Undergraduate students, including me, and a
Year 4 Computer Engineering Undergraduate student.

=== About the Project

This project is part of the module 'Software Engineering CS2103T' where we were tasked to develop a basic
command line interface desktop application by morphing or enhancing an existing AddressBook desktop application.
Our team decided to incorporate and morph the AddressBook application as part of our all-in-one application which
enables treasurers or members of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Clubs and Societies to manage their club finances,
reimbursements, inventory and members' contact details easily. The duration of our project was 13 weeks.

=== Key to the Icons and Formatting Used in the Document

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates extra information or definition.

`Model` :
Text with this font and grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of
the application. It also indicates a generic command format for the command box in the User Guide.

[blue]`command` :
Text with this blue font and grey highlight indicates a command that can be inputted by the user.

=== Introduction to treasurerPro

This desktop application consists of 6 tabs, a command box for users to input their commands and a response box
for Leo, our lion mascot. Each tab serves a different purpose that helps treasurers and members better manage their club
or society's finances.

Home Tab keeps track of individual transactions. Members Tab keep track of all contact
details of members. Reimbursements Tab keeps track of reimbursement records for members that have spent money for club activities.
Inventory Tab keeps track of items for sale. Cashier Tab helps the club with on-site sales
and directly inputs all revenue into the system. Overview Tab allows treasurers to plan the
club's finances.
This is what our application looks like when it is first opened (Graphical User Interface of treasurerPro):

== Summary of Contributions
My role was to design and write the code for the features of Home Tab. The following sections shows a summary of these
features, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in
relation to these features.

*Enhancements*

//This section explains the rationale behind the features of the Home Tab.

////
* Adding, Deleting and Editing Transactions
The basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) commands were added such that the user can [blue]`*add*`, [blue]`*delete*` and
[blue]`*edit*` transactions to keep track of them.
** What it does:
It allows the user to create, delete and update transactions. It also allows the application to restore data from
previous usage of the application by reading and saving data in a background text file.

** Justification:
It forms the fundamental features required for the `Home Tab` to be useful for users to keep track of transactions.

** Highlights:
These commands help to store and keep track of transactions in the `Home Tab` but also help keep track of sales
transactions from the `Cashier Tab`. The transactions for each member's spending in this tab are also tabulated in the
`Reimbursement Tab` to help the treasurer keep track of pending reimbursements.

A [blue]`*sort*` command was implemented for the transactions in the table to sort the commands to a certain order.

////
* Deleting Transactions of a Specific Member
** What it does:
This feature allows all transactions linked to a specified member to be deleted at once.

** Justification:
This feature allows the user to clear all transaction records linked to a specific member if the member
has left the CCA since a member's details can only be deleted in Members Tab if the member does not have existing transaction
records.

** Highlights:
This feature is a faster way to delete transactions of a specific member, especially if the member has many transaction
records. This works well with the deletion of member feature in Members Tab.

* Sorting Transactions in a Specific Order
** What it does:
Each transaction records consists of a date, description, category, amount of money and
person accountable for the transaction. Thus, this feature helps to sort the transactions by the alphabetical order of
the person's name, by the date (from oldest to most recent) or amount (from smallest to largest).

** Justification:
It is useful for users to keep track of transactions and view the transaction records according to different
priority.

** Highlights:
This command can be extended easily to allow for sorting of transactions in the reverse order or with other different orders.
////
* Finding and Filtering Transactions by Keywords

** What it does:
The command allows user to filter transactions to only show those that match the keywords from all
the transactions recorded.

** Justification:
This works well with other commands. It allows users to easily filter transactions to further call
another command to manage the transactions better.

==== Go and Exit Command
//A [blue]`*find*` command was also implemented to help find specific transactions that match the keywords inputted by the user.

Lastly, a [blue]`*go*` command and [blue]`*exit*` command was implemented to help navigate to another tab
and leave the application.

* What it does:
The [blue]`*go*` command helps the user to navigate to another tab without having to click on the tab and the
[blue]`*exit*` command allows the user to leave the application without having to click on the window's exit icon
as well.

* Justification: This ensures the application is a command-line interface application which requires no clicking
at all.

=== Current Enhancement
{Start of First Extract from User Guide}

:sectnums!:
==== 5.1.2. To Delete Transactions in the Home Tab

This command allows you to delete either all transactions of a person or a single transaction of a specific ID from the table.

* Command:
`delete ID` or `delete p/PERSON`

* Examples
** Delete by ID: [blue]`delete 1` - Deletes the transaction at the index shown in the table. If the table shows a filtered
list of transactions due to the find command detailed in
https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#findCommandHome[Section 5.1.5. To Find Transactions that Match Keywords in the Home Tab],
the 1st transaction in the filtered list is deleted.
** Delete by Person: [blue]`delete p/Alex Yeoh` - Deletes all transactions of the person in full list of transactions.

* Steps for Deleting by ID
1. Type the command with the ID of the transaction to be deleted as shown in the screenshot below:

image::homeUG/HomeDeleteStep1cr.png[width = "750"]


[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`. Leo will respond with a success message and the transaction will be removed from the table as shown below:

image::homeUG/HomeDeleteStep2cr.png[width = "750"]


* Steps for Deleting by Person
1. Type the command with the person's name to delete all transactions related to that person, as shown in the screenshot below:

image::homeUG/HomeDeletePStep1cr.png[width = "750"]

[start = 2]
2. Hit `Enter`. Leo will respond with the success message and the transaction(s) will be removed from the table as shown below:

image::homeUG/HomeDeletePStep2cr.png[width = "750"]

For both delete commands, if the transaction(s) deleted was part of a pending reimbursement record, it will also be removed from that
reimbursement record. On the other hand, if the person entered is not part of our database as shown in the Members Tab,
Leo will respond with a message to inform you. If the person does not have any transactions, Leo will also respond with a message to inform you.

==== 5.1.4. To Sort Transactions in the Home Tab

This command sorts the table of transactions into the specified order for viewing and carrying out of subsequent commands.

* To sort
** By date (from oldest to most recent): [blue]`sort date`
** By name (from alphabetical order of name): [blue]`sort name`
** By amount (from smallest to largest in amount): [blue]`sort amount`
** Undo sort: [blue]`sort reset`

[NOTE]
The undo sort command allows you to view the table of transactions in the order originally shown when the application was initially opened.

* Steps
1. Type any one of the above commands in blue font into the command box.

2. Hit `Enter`. The table will now be sorted in the specified order for you.

[NOTE]
The `XYZTabParser` represents the `TransactionTabParser` for Home Tab and `ReimbursementTabParser` for the Reimbursements
tab.

The parsers represented by the `ABCParser` and `DEFParser` are:

`ABCParser`:

* Transaction Tab:
** `EditCommandParser`
** `AddCommandParser`
** `DeleteCommandParser`

==== 3.1.2. Delete Feature

This section explains the implementation of the delete command in Home Tab. This feature allows for 2 types of deletion, by
the index shown in the table or by the person's name. Inputting the person's name will cause all transactions linked to
that person to be deleted.
The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to delete a new transaction:

[caption = "Figure 19. "]
.Activity diagram of the delete command being executed in Home Tab (transaction package)
image::HomeTabActivityDiagramDeleteCommand.png[width = "500"]

The above activity diagram assumes the index to be within the bounds of the table but if it is not, a response will
be shown about the incorrect input. Also, as shown above, responses will be shown to indicate if an input is incorrect or
when a successful deletion is done.

For the implementation, the `DeleteCommandParser` which is represented in https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#GeneralLogicSD[2.3. Logic component: Figure 5]
as a generic parser creates either a `DeleteIndexCommand` or `DeleteNameCommand` object according to the user input.
The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeleteNameCommand` is created with the definition of `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel#getPersonByName` defined in
https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#getPersonByName[3.1.1. Add Command Feature]:

[caption = "Figure 20. "]
.Sequence diagram of the parser for the delete command to delete by the `Person` 's name
image::DeleteCommandParser.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the command to delete transactions according to the specified name works after it is created which is referenced in https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#GeneralLogicSD[2.3. Logic component: Figure 5]:

[caption = "Figure 21. "]
.Sequence diagram of the delete command being executed in Home Tab (transaction package)
image::HomeDeleteNameCommand.png[width = "300"]

In addition, the `Model#resetPredicate()` method defined in
 https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#resetPredicate[3.1.1. Add Command Feature] is not called in the `DeleteNameCommand`. If the prior input is a
find command and the list at the start of the activity diagram shows
a filtered list, the table in the UI will continue to show the filtered list after the current delete command.
To view the full transaction list, the user would be required to enter the
back command where `BackCommand` calls `Model#resetPredicate()`. The sequence diagram for the `BackCommand` is shown in the
following section <<BackCommandSD, 3.1.3. Back Command Feature>>.

After this, the list of transactions and Reimbursement Tab is updated as shown in https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#updateTL[3.1.1. Add Command feature: Figure 16]
and https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#update-reimbursement[3.1.1. Add Command feature: Figure 17]
respectively.

The implementation of the command to delete transactions according to the specified index would be similar but does not require interaction with the `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel` from the
`AddressBook` in the person package inside its branch in `DeleteCommandParser`. In `DeleteIndexCommand`, it also calls the
`Model#findTransactionInFilteredListByIndex(index)` and `Model#deleteTransaction(index)` instead which deletes the `Transaction` object according
to its position in the filtered transaction list.

==== 3.1.3. Back Command Feature

[[BackCommandSD]]
This section explains the implementation of the back command feature in Home Tab.
The `BackCommand` is not initialised by a specific command parser as shown in as shown in
 https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#GeneralLogicSD[2.3. Logic component: Figure 5]
but initialised by the `TransactionTabParser` instead.
The following detailed sequence diagram shows how the back command works:

[caption = "Figure 22. "]
.Sequence diagram of the back command being executed in Home Tab (transaction package)
image::HomeTabBackCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width = "500"]

==== 3.1.4. Sort Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the sort command feature in Home Tab.
The sort command allows for 3 types of sort, by name in
alphabetical order, by amount (from least to most) and by date (from oldest to most recent).

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort command works which is referenced in
https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#GeneralLogicSD[2.3. Logic component: Figure 5]:

[caption = "Figure 23. "]
.Sequence diagram of the sort command being executed in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabSortSD.png[width = "300"]

When a user inputs the sort command, it is only checked that it is one of the 3 types or it will show a response about
the incorrect user input. When it is successfully sorted, there will also be a response message shown.

Similar to the delete command in <<DeleteCommandHome, 3.1.2. Delete Command Feature>>, the `Model#resetPredicate()` method is not called. If the UI table is showing a filtered
list of transactions, the back command must be entered to call that method from `BackCommand` to reset the predicate.

==== 3.1.5. Overall Design Considerations

This section's table explains the design considerations for some implementations in the Home Tab.

|===
|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 |Conclusion and Explanation

|`ModelManager` contains 2 attributes that point to a `TransactionList` object in original order and a `TransactionList`
object for viewing in the UI table that can be sorted such that when [blue]`sort reset` is called, the `TransactionList` for viewing can be set to be equals to the original one.
|`ModelManager` contains only the shown `TransactionList` that can be sorted and reads from the data file to get
the `TransactionList` object in original order when [blue]`sort reset` is called.
|Alternative 1 has been implemented. Alternative 1 allows the data file to be exported in the desired order anytime while treasurerPro is running while
alternative 2 meant that the data file would be updated only when treasurerPro is exited. The implementation is shown in <<lists, Figure 24>>, below the table.

|The Members Tab's `Model` interface is passed as parameters into Transaction Tab's `Logic` to give `Logic` access to all public methods
of `ModelManager`.
|A new interface is made to allow the only used method of Members Tab's `ModelManager` to be accessed in Transaction Tab's
`Logic`.
|Alternative 2 has been implemented. The new interface acts as a facade for `ModelManager` which prevent unwanted modifications
to `AddressBook`. The interface implemented is `CheckAndGetPersonByNameOnlyModel` as shown in <<facade, Figure 25>>, below the table.

|An `ArrayList` is used to store `Transaction` objects in `TransactionList`.
|A `LinkedList` is used to store `Transaction` objects in `TransactionList`.
|Alternative 1 has been implemented. An `ArrayList` has better performance for the set and get methods than a `LinkedList` which would be used frequently in `ModelManager`.
