This module focuses on the different patterns of culture and their mutual exchange in South Asia, through study of a variety of media like art, theatre, TV, advertising, and cinema, in order to arrive at a general understanding of the cultural situation in contemporary South Asia, and to gain deeper insight into emerging trends and fashions.",
