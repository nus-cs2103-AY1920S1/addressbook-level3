The emphasis is on showing how different techniques can optimally be combined in the study of problems that arise at some levels of nervous system organization. Several fundamental aspects of neuroscience research techniques, including: (1) biochemical, (2) anatomical staining, (3) behavioural, (4) electrophysiological and (5) fluorescence and functional imaging approaches will be discussed",
