== LiBerry

=== Overview

In the spirit of spreading education, literacy and a sense of community to the world (and completing our software engineering project), my team has developed
Liberry - a desktop software for managing community and private libraries. The target users are mainly librarians in under-developed communities who cannot afford
commercial versions of such software.

LiBerry can execute the basic functions of library management:

* Addition and deletion of books in the catalog
* Registering Borrowers and editing their particulars
* Loan, return, renew and pay fine functions
* Searching through books in the catalog by filters

As part of the requirements of the project, we were given the source code for a common AddressBook
application and were tasked to morph it to something else that is useful.
We were also limited to designing software that takes in the majority of user input through a Command Line Interface
(CLI), though displays information through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This is what the GUI looks like:

.Graphical User Interface (GUI) for *LiBerry*

My role was to:

. configure the basic AddressBook software to accommodate Json-type storage for a catalog, a record of borrowers,
and a record of loans
. design the *Find Command* to execute given a set of parameters - such as searching by title, genre, loan status etc
. Add a *Clear Command* to clear user searches
. design the GUI in terms of color schemes
. create the *Toggle UI Command* to allow users to switch the GUI between 'light mode' and 'dark mode' themes
. Create sample data for testing

== Summary of Contributions

=== *Major enhancement - Finding by various parameters* +
Allows the user to *filter the catalog by various parameters*

==== What it does
... Searches books in catalog and displays them on the screen through filtering by:
.... title
.... author
.... serial number
.... genres
.... loan status (available / loaned / overdue)
... sets the number of books to display on the screen

==== Justification +
As a librarian who is keeping charge of book and loan records, the ability to find books and their loan statuses fast is necessary.

==== Highlights +
This enhancement was decently demanding as it required a way to test every book on whether it met the query requirements.
It showcases my ability to play with functional programming and Streams in Java.
As the predicate used has multiple possible combinations, extensive tests were written to ensure that it worked the way it should.

=== *Minor enhancement - Switching GUI themes* +
Allows the user to toggle the GUI between 'light mode' and 'dark mode'.

==== Justification +
As a librarian who may work after the sun has set, this command helps to switch the GUI into a more eye-friendly mode when using the software.

==== Highlights +
This feature was rather challenging as it required a decent amount of CSS knowledge and the ability to manipulate JavaFx elements.
