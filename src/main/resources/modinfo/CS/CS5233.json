    "description": "This module aims to provide students with a working knowledge of applying simulation techniques to model, simulate and study complex systems. It covers techniques in simulation model design, model execution, and model analysis. Students will have hands-on experience using a simulation package. The module will also introduce concepts of parallel and distributed simulation, and high level architecture.",
