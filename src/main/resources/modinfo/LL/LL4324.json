    "description": "This module takes a comparative approach to exploring what is meant by a trade mark, the messages that trade marks communicate and the roles they perform. These are important enquiries because questions of what trade marks do and ought to do have a direct impact on the contours of the law. A major theme will be the relationship between trade marks and brands: to what extent should trade mark law be concerned with protecting brand value? What might a focus on brand value mean for competitors? Is a focus on brand value compatible with the logics of trade mark registration? These questions will be explored by reference to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, most significantly Australia, the EU, Singapore and the USA.",
