    "description": "This module deals with the questions that CEOs of companies and serial entrepreneurs always ponder: 'Where is the next big opportunity?', 'Where should we look?', 'How do we leverage our existing knowledge?' Market Innovation introduces a rarely taught, analytical framework for systematic innovation - identifying and screening unmet market opportunities. It is an experiential module where students apply this framework to identify and screen opportunities in pre-selected markets. The objective of the course is to teach students how to systematically identify gaps in the selected market and match them with existing technical capabilities to recognize opportunities for economic or social innovation.",
