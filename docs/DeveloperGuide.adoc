== Introduction

=== Purpose

This Developer Guide specifies the software architecture, design, and major implementation features of our Desktop Application, AddMin+.

=== Intended Audience

The intended audience of this Developer Guide is for fellow developers looking to contribute to this open-source project and the graders of the CS2103T module.

=== Software Description

AddMin+ is an all in one administration desktop application, specifically for use by small companies with limited administrative staff and would benefit from automating their menial administrative tasks.

The application primarily uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) and displays the results through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

=== Using this Developer Guide

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

._Architecture Diagram_
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

._Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

._Component interactions for `delete 1` command_
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

._Structure of the UI Component_
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
There are also `ScheduleBox`, `Finance`, `StatisticBox` which are of the tabs in the TabPane of `MainWindow`, of which all of them inherits from the abstract class `Tabs`.
The abstract class `Tabs` also inherits from the abstract class `UiPart`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
._Structure of the Logic Component_
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `AddMinParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an employee or event).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as adding events and allocating manpower.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

._Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

._Structure of the Model Component_
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Employee Book and Event Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in both `Employee Book` and `Event Book`, which `Employee` can reference.
This would allow our application to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

// tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

._Structure of the Storage Component_
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width = "500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the App data in json format and read it back.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addmin.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Statistics feature

==== Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time and generates statistics via the `statistics /g` command.

Step 2. Statistics are generated on-demand and displayed to the user based on the current data.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How statistics executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate statistics data on-demand, when the user requests.
** Pros: Easier to implement as would not have to mannage storage of statistical data.
** Cons: App may have overall lower performance, with the possibility of lag as the app needs to read through all the stored data and generate the statistics data whenever it is queried.
* **Alternative 2:** Generate statistics each time there is change in the data and store them.
** Pros: Statistical data will be displayed faster as it is recalculated and stored in the JSON file storage.
** Cons: Requires managing the storage of the statistical data and possibly lead to lowered performance of other features such as the command which does CRUD to Employees/Events which will be slower with the need to generate the statistical data and store it in the JSON file storage.
// end::statistics[]

// tag::calvin[]
=== Automated allocation of Employees to Events feature

==== Implementation

The `AutoAllocateCommand` has an auto-allocation mechanism which is facilitated by methods in `Event`.
The `AutoAllocateCommand` takes in three arguments:

1. `eventIndex` - index of event in the displayed event list
2. `ManpowerCountToAdd` - number of employees to allocate [optional]
3. `tagList` - a set of tags to filter the employees [optional]

Additionally, the `AutoAllocateCommand` uses the following operations:

* `Event#isAvailableForEvent()` -- Checks if an employee is available for the event.
* `AutoAllocateCommand#createAvailableEmployeeListForEvent()` -- Creates a list of employees available for the event, filtered by the tags specified by user.
* `AutoAllocateCommand#getManpowerNeededByEvent()` -- Calculates the number of employees currently required by the event.
* `AutoAllocateCommand#createEventAfterManpowerAllocation()` -- Creates a new event with an updated manpower list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the auto allocation mechanism behaves at each step.

._Program flow of the Auto Allocate Feature_
image::AutoAllocateFlowChart.png[align="center",width = "300"]

**Step 1**.
The user executes `allocate 1 n/2 t/female` with the intention to allocate 2 employees with tag [female]
to the 1st event displayed in the event list.

**Step 2**.
The command checks if `eventIndex` is valid and if `ManpowerCountToAdd` is specified.
The command also checks if the event still requires manpower, and if manpower count stated by user exceeds that needed by the event.

[NOTE]
If `ManpowerCountToAdd` is not specified, it is assumed to be the maximum number possible for the event.

**Step 3**.
The command calls its own method `AutoAllocateCommand#getManpowerNeededByEvent()` to get the number of employees required by the specified event.

**Step 4**.
The command calls its own method `AutoAllocateCommand#createAvailableEmployeeListForEvent()` to create a filtered list of employees based on the `tagList` and if employee satisfies `Event#isAvailableForEvent()`.

**Step 5**.
The command checks if supply (generated in *step 4*) exceeds demand (generated in *step 3*) of the event.

[NOTE]
If demand exceeds supply, an exception will be thrown to the user.
If the supply exceeds demand, employees will be randomly selected instead.

**Step 6**.
The command calls `Event#createEventAfterManpowerAllocation()` to create a new event with an updated manpower list.

[NOTE]
For storage purposes, only the `Employee#EmployeeId` is saved in the event's manpower list.

**Step 7**.
Done.

The following sequence diagram shows how the auto allocation works:

._Sequence Diagram of the AutoAllocate Command_
image::AutoAllocateSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AutoAllocateCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of employees associated with event after successful command

[width="100%",options="header" cols="3, 4, 4"]
|========================================================================================
|Feature      |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Storage of employees associated with event after successful command
|Saves only the `Employee#EmployeeId` associated with the event.

*Pros*: Easy to implement. Will use less memory.

*Cons*: Future accesses require more time.

*I decided to proceed with this option* because it has less dependencies on other classes which is is a good
programming practice.

|Saves all fields of `Employee` associated with the event.

*Pros*: Easy retrieval in the future.

*Cons*: Changes in `Employee` attributes have to be reflected in the event. This meant that `EditCommand` and
`DeleteCommand` for `Employee` have to be heavily modified.

| Update of changes made to the manpower list of an event after the allocation of employees.
| Directly modifies the `EventManpowerAllocatedList` of the specified event

*Pros*: Easy to implement.

*Cons*: May cause unwanted behaviours if testing is not done properly.

| Create a new event with a newly created and updated manpower list.

*Pros*: Good programming practice.

*Cons*: Harder to implement.

*I decided to proceed with this option* because it complies with the Law of Demeter
which states that objects should not navigate internal structures of other objects.

=== Setting Date & Time to Events

==== Implementation

The `Event` object is constructed with a start date and an end date as class attributes, both of which are `EventDate` objects, which represents a single day by itself.
Our implementation of `Event` does not assume that the event will be occurring consecutively from the start to the end date, and requires the user to manually assign each specific date with the time period that the Event is in process.

[NOTE]
In our implementation, when the Event is instantiated, the time period of 0800-1800 is automatically created and mapped to the Start & End Dates of the Event.

To achieve this functionality, there exists an `EventDayTime` object that encapsulates the period of the day.
It has two class attributes - both of which are `LocalTime` objects to represent the start and end time.

Each Event contains an `EventDateTimeMap` object that maps an `EventDate` object to an `EventDayTime` object using a HashMap implementation.
This mapping is added through the `EventAssignDate` command.

It requires the use of the following objects/methods from the `event` package.

* `EventContainsKeyDatePredicate` - Check whether the stated date exists within the range of the Event's Start and End Date.
* `Event#assignDateTime` - Calls the `EventDateTimeMap` object to insert a Date-Time mapping.
* `EventDate#datesUntil` - Returns a Stream of `EventDates` from the Start to End Date.
Used to auto-set a DateTime mapping for all dates.

[NOTE]
To improve user productivity and effectiveness, omitting the target date from the command text will automatically create the mapping for every date from the Event's start to end date, inclusive.
Alternatively, by specifying both a start and end date range in the command text, a mapping for the range will be created.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the program functionality when a user attempts to assign a Date & Time to an already existent Event.

**Step 1**.
The User executes the command `set_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019 time/0900-2000`, with the intention to assign the date of 18th October 2019, time period 9am-8pm to the second event currently displayed in the event list.
If the date is omitted, i.e. `set_ev_dt 2 time/0900-2000`, the time period 0900-2000 will be automatically assigned for all dates from the start to end date of the Event.
Alternatively, if the end date is stated, i.e. `set_ev_dt 2 on/18/10/2019 time/22/10/2019 time/0900-2000`, the time period of 0900-2000 will be assigned for all dates from 18th to 22nd of October.

**Step 2**.
The parser checks if input format is correct, and attempts to create `Index`, `EventDate` and `EventDayTime` objects from it

**Step 3**.
The command checks if the index of the event stated exists on the displayed list, and if the stated dates is within the start and end date of the Event.
(Input Validation)

**Step 4**.
The command calls `Event#assignDateTime()` on the referenced Event object to add the EventDate-EventDayTime mapping into `EventDateTimeMap`.

**Step 5**.
If only a single target date is stated, continue to Step 6. Else, the system will repeat Step 4 through the entire date range - which is either the start and end date of the `Event` or the range specified by the user.

**Step 6**.
DateTimeMapping is converted a String to save and update in Storage.

**Step 7**.
Done.

[NOTE]
If the command execution fails, a `ParseException` (from Step 2) or a `CommandException` (from Step 3) will be thrown, specifiying the reason of the error.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `AssignDateCommand` works:

NOTE: The lifeline for `AssignDateCommand` ends at the destroy marker (X).

The following activity diagram shows how the Setting of Date&Time to Event work:

._Activity Diagram of the SettingEventDate Command_
image::SettingEventDateActivityDiagram.png[SettingEvent,295,607]

==== Design Considerations

Below, we discuss two key aspects - how we store EventDateTimeMap and how commands to edit `Event` affect the `EventDateTimeMap`.

[width="100%",options="header" cols="3, 4, 4"]
|========================================================================================
|Aspect      |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
| **Storage of DateTimeMap**

| Stores the DateTimeMap in an string format that is saved in a field of an `Event` in `eventbook.json`. +

**Pros:** Simplicity in implementation and easier reference as it is loaded and saved to the same JSON file.

**Cons:** Performance issues as it needs to update the entire event object although only one attribute is updated

| Store the DateTimeMap in a separate file e.g. `EventDateTimes.json` that will be referenced by EventBook during initialization.

**Pros:** Faster performance in saving and loading as it is kept separate from `eventbook.json` and hence will not

**Cons:** Requires a new storage unit, along with all its supporting functions which will require alot of repeated code.
Instantiation of the `Event` object when the app is started will be more complicated as well due to the need to read from two separate files

3+|**Decision: Alternative 1** +

Alternative 2 would make sense if our app is utilizing a DBMS and it would be a best practice to separate the information into separate tables.
However, as we are constrained with not utilizing a DBMS, **Alternative 1** is a logically simpler, shorter, and more efficent solution from a software engineering standpoint as it limits the amount of repeated code that we would have written to support another storage unit.

| **Impact of Edit Event on `EventDateTimeMap`**  +

The `edit_ev` command does not edit the DateTime mapping of an `Event` itself - this is done through the `set_ev_dt` or the `delete_ev_dt` instead. However, if the event has its start or end date fields edited, it will affect the `EventDateTimeMap` as its mapping may suddenly be out of range of the edited `Event` start and end dates.

| Prevent the editing of Event Dates if the `Event` date range is reduced and will cause existing Date-Time Mappings to fall out of edited Event's Start-End Date Range.

**Pros:**
Greatly reduce the potential for buggy behavior, as `EventDateTimeMap` would contain false mappings that do not correspond to the new Event's Start-End Date Range. User would not have to worry about the inadvertent loss of data.

**Cons:**
Negative User Experience - Will need to take extra steps to manually delete DateTime mappings.

| Allow editing of Event Dates if the `Event` date range is reduced, but will clear `EventDate` mappings in `EventDateTimeMap` that fall out of edited Event's Start-End Date Range.

**Pros:**
Better User Experience - Narrowing the Start/End Date would naturally mean that the user no longer require mappings on those dates and hence they can be safely deleted.

**Cons:**
Increased risk of inadvertent deletion of existing Date-Time mappings from `Event`.

3+|**Decision: Alternative 2** +

Alternative 2 offers better user experience by reducing the addition steps of hassle, especially since AddMin+ is focussed on automating and reducing the burdensome workload of administrative staff. Even so, we understand the risk of a user executing a typo and inadvertently delete existing Date-Time mappings. Hence, as a mitgating measure, we would be introducing a 'Confirmation' command in a `V2.0` feature that would allow the user to confirm and proceed with the `edit_ev` command if it were to delete existing Date-Time mappings due to a narrowing of the range.

=== Generate Schedule Feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The Generate Schedule Feature is implemented to allow users to have an overview of the event schedule.
It will display all dates that have an event and the specific events that are happening on those dates listed.
Do note that the `generate_schedule` command will only display dates and events that have a set date and time allocated to it.
The feature is facilitated by a `DistinctDatesProcessor` and requires the use of a new Object - `DistinctDate`, as well as an internal ObservableList - `distinctDatesList` found in the `ModelManager`.

The `DistinctDateProcessor` processes the entire list of Events in the `EventList` when the command is called.
The `DistinctDateProcessor` will then process through these events to create specific `DistinctDate` Objects which stores a list of events that occurs on the date they are representing.
These DistinctDate Objects are then used, to create `DateCard` which will be displayed on the GUI. This feature can be seen in the generate schedule window as well as the employee fetch window.

The `DistinctDateProcessor` utilises the following operations in the `generate_schedule` command:

* `generateAllDistinctDateList(Model model)` -- Returns a list of `DistinctDate` Objects.
This operation utilises the generateDistinctDateList() operations.
* `generateDistinctDateList(List<Event> eventList)` -- Returns a list of `DistinctDate` Objects.
This operation utilises the generateDateList() and generateListOfEventForDate() operations.
* `generateDateList(List<Event> eventList)` -- Takes in the entire list of events, identify all the dates that have been mapped to which that has at least one event and returns it as a list.
* `generateListOfEventForDate(EventDate date, Model model)` -- Takes in an `EventDate` object, and processes through the entire list of events, to find all events on that specific date, and return them as a list.

The following class diagram shows the relationships between the different classes used by the `generate_schedule` command:

._Class Diagram for GenerateScheduleCommand_
image::GenerateScheduleClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

---
Below is an example usage scenario and how the `display_schedule` command behaves at each step.

._Program flow of the Generate Schedule Feature_
image::GenerateScheduleFlowChart.png[align="center",width = "300"]

**Step 1**.
The user launches the application for the first time.

**Step 2**.
The `distinctDatesList` will be initialised based on the initial event book state.

**Step 3**.
The user executes `add_ev n/Free Coffee ...` to add a new event into the Eventlist.
The distinctDatesList will not be updated, and will not contain the new event that is added.

[NOTE]
Any command that alters the eventBook will not change the distinctDatesList.
The distinctDatesList will continue to store the original list until the User requires it by calling the `generate_schedule` command, where the distinctDateList will be generated again using the current EventList.

**Step 4**.
The user executes `generate_schedule` to see all the dates that have a set time mapping and the respective events on those dates.

**Step 5**.
The distinctDateList will be generated again based on the current list of events in the EventList and will be displayed on a separate window.

**Step 6**.
The user now decides to close the app, the current state of the EventBook and EmployeeBook will be stored, however, the DistinctDateList would not.

[NOTE]
Note that the Display Schedule Feature does not load and store the DistinctDate Objects.
It processes and generates the list when it is called upon or when the application starts.

**Step 7**.
Done.

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%",options="header" cols="3, 4, 4"]
|========================================================================================
|Feature      |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Data Structure to support Generate Schedule Command
|Generates and Processes the DistinctDate Object upon `generate_schedule` command. (Current choice)

*Pros*: Easy to implement and requires less Storage Capacity and storage infrastructure to support the entire feature.

*Cons*: May have performance issues in terms of speed and time Complexity if the user's database gets extremely big. The program will have to iterate through the entire list of events and create
the corresponding `DistinctDate` objects, whenever `generate_schedule` command is called.

**Decision: Alternative 1
** Alternative 1 makes more logical sense and will be more efficient as compared to Alternative 2. Alternative 1 requires less intermediate processing and storage units to support the feature.
Processing is only done when it is needed. Looking at the use case of the `generate_schedule` command, it is likely to be used when the users have finalised all the events and details before generating
the schedule.

|Creates and Stores the DistinctDate object whenever a new event is added.

*Pros*: Do not have to create a new list of DistinctDate object every time it is called.

*Cons*: May have performance issues in terms of storage and processing needed, requires new storage unit to store a new entity which is not as important
and frequently used. This implementation can cause speed and time complexity issues as well, whenever edits are made to the existing eventList - add_ev, delete_ev, etc
the program is required to process through all DistinctDate Object to make the necessary changes. If the user does not even want to call the `generate_schedule` command
after the changes, then this process is actually unnecessary and redundant.

| UI Decisions for Generate Schedule Command
| Display Directly on the Schedule Tab, update the list when `generate_schedule` command is called

*Pros*: Users are able to view the generated schedule directly from the application's schedule tab, without the need of another window.

*Cons*: May cause confusion, as the list being displayed might be outdated if the user forgets to call the `generate_schedule` command after altering the events.

| Display on a separate window generates and display the list on the new window when `generate_schedule` command is called. (Current choice)

*Pros*: Allows for better user experience since the generated list is only displayed when the user needs it. Ensures that the list being
displayed is always updated as of when the user needs it, since the window is only produced when `generate_schedule` command is called.

*Cons*: Harder to implement, requires additional JavaFx windows and implementations. Will require additional windows being opened.

**Decision: Alternative 2
** Alternative 2 is a cleaner and more user-friendly approach compared to Alternative 1. Alternative 2 helps to prevent the Schedule Tab from being filled with too many lists and information.
Alternative 2 also helps prevent user confusion, as the list that is displayed is always updated as of when it is called upon.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts.
The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size.
Move the window to a different location.
Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting an employee

. Deleting an employee while all employees are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all employees using the `list_em` command.
Multiple employees in the list.
.. Test case: `delete_em 1` +
   Expected: Employee of ID '1' is deleted from the list.
Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.
Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete_em 0` +
   Expected: No employee is deleted.
Error details shown in the status message.
Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing data files

.. Go to the home folder where AddMin+ is located.
.. Delete every file except the .jar file.
.. Open the jar file again, a sample set of Employee and Event data should be loaded.

. Dealing with corrupted data files

.. Go to the home folder where AddMin+ is located.
Open the data folder which should contain employeebook.json and eventbook.json files.
.. Open one of the json file and corrupt the file.
.. Open the jar file again, AddMin+ should still run with one of the list data loaded.
