    "description": "In this module, we will read seven lively novels by major nineteenth\u2010century women writers and discuss how women writers contributed to the development of the classic realist novel and the gothic novel. Thematic foci include contemporary views of gender, especially the ideologies of 'separate spheres' and 'the angel in the house'; colonialism and industrialization; social class; and religious agitation and religious doubt. The class will also read and evaluate a few important critical articles concerning the women\u2019s tradition in the English novel.",
