== Implementation

//tag::overallRank[]

==== Overall Rank feature
The user can list the persons in the system by the number of times they won a competition.

Format: `overallRank`

Due to time limitations we have not allowed the user to specify any other ranking method but given
the design of our system which is highly extensible, it would not be hard to do so in future
versions.

Pros:

* Takes in no parameters so user will make minimal mistakes.

* Avoid complications between unmatched name and person.

* Easy to implement.

Cons:

* User will have to scroll through the person list if it is very long to find a specific name.
