    "description": "This module aims to expose students to women's position and gender discrimination in South Asia, relating these to broader aspects of society, economy and culture. Comparisons with the students' own experiences, leading to appreciation of cross-cultural perspectives on women and gender, are part of the envisaged learning outcomes. Topics covered include women's position in the family and the kin-group, the market, social and political institutions, violence and trafficking, feminist critiques, activism and resistance, cinematic and literary expressions. The module would be of general interest to all students concerned about women's position and gender, as well those interested in South Asia.",
