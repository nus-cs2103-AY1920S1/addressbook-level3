    "description": "The unique aspect of this module is that it allows students to meet successful members of the local biotechnology community. This provides an opportunity to learn directly from industry leaders about commercially viable technologies, and about the job roles and lifestyles of industry scientists. This will be done by examining specific companies as 'case studies'. Each case study will involve the evaluation of the company\u2019s technology and the market environment. This module is ideal for students considering industry or alternative (non-research) careers, and would like to make contacts and gain insight into such roles.",
