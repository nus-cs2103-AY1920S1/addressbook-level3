    "description": "This module will expose students to advanced topics in state-society relationship and governance within the context of rapid changes in information and communication technologies (ICTs). It addresses how the notions of `community', 'citizenship', and 'democracy' have been changed by the creation of a transnational public sphere due to ICTs. The module will also address how the emergence of an informational economy changes the role of the state, especially in terms of preparing society for the challenges ahead. Works of John Urry, Manuel Castells, Bob Jessop, Frank Webster and David Lyon, among others, will be discussed and critiqued.",
