== Introduction

This section specifies the purpose of this document and design goals of Athletick.

=== Purpose

This document describes the software architecture and system design of Athletick, a team management desktop application for coaches and team captains of timing-based performance sports. It also includes some of the design considerations for the implementation of Athletick's features.

The intended audience of this document includes the developers and software testers of Athletick.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document

[horizontal]

NOTE:: This symbol indicates important information

`command`:: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command line and executed by the application.

`[green]#component#`:: Green text with grey highlight indicates a component, class, object or method in the architecture of the application.

=== Design goals

Athletick was developed as part of https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T/software-engineering[CS2103T], a software engineering module taken in the National University of Singapore. We were tasked to morph a generic https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[address book application] that manages contacts into an application that manages something else. At the end of the project, it should be ready to be continued by future developers.

As part of the project constraints, the input to Athletick needs to be primarily Command-Line Interface (CLI). Non-CLI inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to our target users. Taking this into consideration, the following principles guide the design of Athletick:

. **Detailed Command Syntax Instructions**
+
In order to make Athletick more user-friendly, we have provided detailed command syntax instructions whenever users enter an erroneous command, allowing them to correct their errors on the fly. This helps users to maintain their workflow without having to switch back and forth between the application and the user guide, enabling them to complete their tasks more efficiently.

. **Optimised Performance**
+
Athletick should be able to hold up to 1000 athletes, attendance and performance records without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage. To achieve this, we have used optimal data structures for storing and retrieval of data.


. **Designer Friendly**
+
As Athletick is intended for future student developers like us to make modifications and extensions to its behaviour, adhering to the high-level design architecture strictly was a necessity. This translates to extensive use of abstractions for code clarity. Additionally, we provided Javadoc comments for our classes and methods for developers to understand how they work.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== System design

This section introduces the high-level design of Athletick and gives you a basic understanding of how each component operates and interacts with one another.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width=400]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Athletick. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Displays the UI of Athletick.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands from the user.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of Athletick in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width=500]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `*ObservableList<Person>*`` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a Tag list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Athletick data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. We have included our design considerations for you to understand our decision making processes.

=== Training feature

Athletick allows users to record training information like date and an athlete's attendance. With this information
recorded, Athletick allows users to get important information like the team's overall attendance rate and an overview
of all training sessions in a month.

==== Implementation
To facilitate this, the `Model` has a `TrainingManager` that stores all `Training`
sessions in Athletick. The class diagram below shows how the different components interact with each other.

image::training_class_diagram.png[]

The `Training` class contains a date and a hash map.
The date in the training class represents the date of training session and the hash map is used to check the
attendance of a Person. We used a `AthletickDate` class to  represent a date of training. This class is shared across
both the `Ui` and backend, allowing training information to be shown in the `view calendar` function.
The hash map uses `Person` objects as keys and a boolean as it’s value. This is used to check whether a `Person` has
attended a training session, indicated by the boolean value attached to  a `Person` key. If a `Person` attended a
training session on that day, the value associated with the key will be  true, and false if he did not attend.

A `TrainingManager` is used to store and manage all `Training` sessions in Athletick. It has a list
containing `Training` sessions. A `Training` is added to this list whenever a user records a `Training` session
using a `TrainingCommand`. The sequence diagram below shows how `TrainingManager` stores and manages training records.

image::add_training.png[]

image::delete_training.png[]

`TrainingManager` provides functions for users to calculate the attendance rate of one individual, or the entire
team. The sequence diagram below shows a use case of how `TrainingManager` gets attendance rate.

image::to_add.png[]

`TrainingManager` also allows users to view `Training` information on a specified date. The sequence diagram below
shows a use case of how `TrainingManager` gets `Training` information.

image::to_add.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Where to store attendance information of an individual.

* Alternative 1: Extend on the `AddressBook` by storing and tagging each person with number of
trainings attended and total number of trainings.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and not useful when we want more detailed information
(attendance on specific date) about a training session.

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Create a separate class to manage Training information.

** Pros: Allows storing of specific training information without depending on the `AddressBook`.

** Cons: Harder to code and introduces more dependencies to Model.


Aspect: Which data structure to store training attendance.
* Alternative 1: Use a linked list to store training attendance.

** Pros: Easy to maintain.

** Cons: Accessing training information requires more time (e.g. accessing attendance rate of one person).

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Use a hash map to store training attendance.

** Pros: Makes obtaining information much quicker.

** Cons: Requires more effort to maintain.

Aspect: How to edit training information

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Edit by replacing with new training on the same date

** Pros: Users no need to type lengthy edit commands.

** Cons: Unable to support multiple trainings on same date.

** Alternative 2: Create a command to support editing of training.

** Pros: More intuitive to a user who wants to edit.

** Cons: Lengthy commands. Users have the option to edit date, attendance and even add a person.

=== Performance feature

=== Calendar feature

To allow users to retrieve training and performance records using the date they were recorded on, Athletick has a calendar feature which provides 2 main functions:

. Displays an overview of training and performance records in a selected month

. Displays training and performance records entered on a specific date

==== Implementation

The implementation of the above functions will be described separately in this section.

===== Function 1: Displays an overview of training and performance records in a selected month

Function 1 is facilitated by `[green]#CalendarPanel#`. It extends `[green]#UiPart<Region>#` and represents the calendar using a `[green]#GridPane#` with dimensions of 7 by 6 (42 cells). Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `[green]#CalendarPanel#retrieveCurrentDate()#` -- Retrieves the details of today's date to be used as the title of the calendar feature and for rendering the displayed month on the calendar when the user does not provide a month to view.
* `[green]#CalendarPanel#retrieveProvidedDate()#` -- Retrieves the details of the date provided by the user for rendering the displayed month on the calendar.
* `[green]#CalendarPanel#initialiseSelectedDate()#` -- Fills up all 42 cells of the `GridPane` with the respective days based on the selected month by the user. Days of the previous and next month used to fill up the remaining cells are marked in a lighter colour.

+
In addition, days with training or performance records will be marked with a small green or purple dot indicator respectively.

These operations are performed when an instance of `[green]#CalendarPanel#` is created in the `[green]#MainWindow#` class. An instance of `[green]#CalendarPanel#` is created when the `[green]#CommandResult#` obtained after executing the user's command contains a `[green]#Feature#` corresponding to a calendar and an optional `[green]#AthletickDate#`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the first function and how the operation behaves at each step:

Step 1:. The user either issues the `view calendar` or `calendar MMYYYY` (e.g. `calendar 012019`) command. The first command displays the calendar for the current month, while the second command displays the calendar for the specified the month and year.

Step 2. The issued command

// to be continued

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calendar MMYYYY` (e.g. `calendar 012019`) operation works:

.Interactions Inside the UI, Logic and Model Components for the `calendar MMYYYY` Command
image::CalendarCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[]

The `view calendar` command is similar except that the `[green]#CalendarPanel#` class is constructed without an `[green]#AthletickDate#` specified by the user. The calendar displayed to the user will reflect the current month and year.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `view calendar` or `calendar MMYYYY` command:

// activity diagram

===== Function 2: Displays training and performance records entered on a specific date

Function 2 is facilitated by `[green]#CalendarDetailPanel#`. It extends `UiPart<Region>` and displays the attendance and performance records for a specific date in a table. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `[green]#CalendarDetailPanel#initialiseAttendanceData#` -- Retrieves and displays the attendance of each person on the specified date.
* `[green]#CalendarDetailPanel#initialisePerformanceData#` -- Retrieves and displays the performance records on the specified date.

These operations are performed when an instance of `[green]#CalendarDetailPanel#` is created in the `[green]#MainWindow#` class. An instance of `CalendarDetailPanel` is created when the `[green]#CommandResult#` obtained after executing the user's command contains an `[green]#AthletickDate#`.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the second function and how the operation behaves at each step:

Step 1: The user either issues the `calendar DDMMYYYY` (e.g. `calendar 01012019`) command.

Step 2. The issued command

// to be continued

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calendar DDMMYYYY` (e.g. `calendar 01012019`) operation works:

.Interactions Inside the UI, Logic and Model Components for the `calendar DDMMYYYY` Command
image::CalendarCommandSequenceDiagram2.png[]

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `calendar DDMMYYYY` command:

// activity diagram (show what happens when records found vs not found)

==== Design considerations

This section contains some of our design considerations for the calendar feature.

===== Aspect: Whether to display information using a monthly calendar or a list only containing dates in a month with training or performance records

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Use a monthly calendar|Alternative 2: Use a monthly list

|**Pros**
a|* Displays information more clearly especially when users have a large number of training and performance records in a month
 * Allows for future expansion of calendar feature with more date-related functionalities (e.g. planning of training programme in advance)
a|* Displays information more concisely if users have a small amount of training and performance records in a month

|**Cons**
a|* Increases difficulty of implementation
a|* Displays information in rows and columns which is no better than using Excel

|===

**Reasons for choice of alternative 1:**

* Alternative 1 displays information more clearly when users have a large amount of training and performance information, which is a probable scenario in the case of sports teams. In contrast, alternative 2 uses a list similar to Excel which we are trying to improve upon.
* Alternative 1 abides by our design principle to keep **Athletick** designer friendly since future developers can expand upon it and implement more date-related functionalities.

===== Aspect: How to display calendar for a month

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Display using a fixed 7 by 6 `[green]#GridPane#`, fill up left over days with days from previous and next month|Alternative 2: Display using a variable sized `[green]#GridPane#` that is populated with days from selected month only

|**Pros**
a|* Makes implementation easier
 * Emulates implementation by other calendar applications (e.g. Google Calendar)
a|* Maximises usage of space in the application window

|**Cons**
a|* Displays information of previous and next month which users may not be interested in
a|* Increases difficulty of implementation

|===

**Reasons for choice of alternative 1:**

* Alternative 1 is easier to implement since the dimensions of the calendar are fixed so we do not have to recalculate it constantly. The ease of implementation is important given the tight deadlines we have to contend with in our software engineering module.
* Alternative 1 emulates the implementation of other successful calendar applications (e.g. Google Calendar) so we do not have to reinvent the wheel.

===== Aspect: How the user can display the attendance and performance data on a specific date

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Use one `calendar DDMMYYYY` command to view _both_ attendance and performance records on the specified date|Alternative 2: Use two separate commands to view attendance and performance records _separately_ on the specified date

|**Pros**
a|* Makes access of data more efficient
a|* Allows users to have more control over what data is displayed

|**Cons**
a|* Displays both attendance and performance records on the specified date all the time
a|* Requires more flags to be added to the command syntax which makes it more complex

|===

**Reasons for choice of alternative 1:**

* Alternative 1 is more user-friendly as it reduces the number of commands users have to remember in order to access the information they want to see. In addition, attendance and performance records are displayed into separate sections in the window so the information will not be cluttered.

=== Select feature
The `select` feature allows user to view the profile of a selected athlete.

==== Implementation
The implementation of the `select` feature consists of two parts, mainly the implementation of the command and the
implementation of the UI.

The implementation of the command is facilitated by `SelectCommand` class. It extends
`Command` and parses the arguments using `SelectCommandParser`. It implements one operation:

* `CommandResult#execute()` -- Executes the selectCommand which returns the athlete selected to be displayed in the UI.

The implementation of the UI portion for the `select` feature  is facilitated by `InformationDisplay`. It extends
`UiPart<Region>` and displays the personal information of the selected athlete. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `InformationDisplay#displayPersonalInfo()` -- Displays the personal information of the selected athlete such as the
name, email, address, phone number and other personal details.

* `InformationDisplay#performanceDisplay()` -- Displays the performance of the selected athlete, which includes the
event, best performance and most recent performance.

An example usage scenario is given below which elaborates how the `select` feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `select 3` command. The command is then parsed by `SelectCommandParser` which creates
an instance of `SelectCommand`. `SelectCommand` retrieves the athlete based on the index of the list panel on the left.
When the command is executed, the athlete selected at the specified index will be stored in ModelManager as
`selectedPerson` using the operation `Model#storePerson(Person)`.

Step 2. After the command has been executed, the selected athlete is retrieved in the MainWindow class. It checks
whether an athlete has been selected and displays the selected athlete's personal information.

The diagram below summarises the steps of the example scenario when a user executes the `select` command:

.Activity diagram of `select` command execution
image::SelectActivityDiagram.png[]

The implementation was done this way because the Ui component interacts with both the Logic and Model component.
Firstly, the Ui component takes in the input from the user and allows `SelectCommandParser` in Logic component to parse
the argument.
After the argument has been parsed, the athlete is stored in the Model component which houses most of the data in the
app. The Ui listens for any changes made to the Model data, and updates the Ui to display the selected athlete.

The following sequence diagram shows the `select` feature works:

.Sequence Diagram of `select` Command
image::SelectCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
There were some decisions that I had to make as I was designing the `select` feature and had to compare which methods
would better suit the application. The following consists of the design considerations for the `select` feature.

===== Aspect: How the personal information of the selected athlete will be displayed
There were a few ways how the personal information of the selected athlete could be displayed and the following
alternatives are some of the considerations I had when implementing.

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Displaying it in a feature box.
** Pros: Minimises the use of mouse and is in line with the other features that is utilizing the feature box.
** Cons: Aesthetic is not as good compared to the other alternatives.
* *Alternative 2*: Displaying it in a tab form.
** Pros: Looks more organised compared to the other alternatives
** Cons: Not as intuitive to use as mouse has to be used to switch around tabs.
* *Alternative 3*: Displaying via a pop-up.
** Pros: Looks neater and organised.
** Cons: Increase the use of mouse to close the window and may be distracting to user.

Reason: Alternative 1 was chosen because it utilises more of the command line interface and we wanted to steer away
from the use of the mouse. Even those the aesthetic might not be as good as alternative 2 and 3, I felt that it was a
better choice as it was in line with the other features that my group mates were going to implement.

===== Aspect: How to select an athlete
There were two ways on how an athlete could be selected and it was between choosing by index or by name which I had
to consider.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Choosing by the index number.
** Pros: Intuitive to use and can be used with other commands such as `FindCommand` and `FilterCommand` to narrow
down the list of people.
** Cons: Additional step of filtering the list to make it shorter before selecting an athlete.
* Alternative 2: Choosing by name.
** Pros: Can omit the filtering step and select the athlete directly.
** Cons: There may be 2 people with the same name and thus result in an error.

Reason: In the end, I went with alternative 1 because it was more intuitive to use and was in line with some of the
other functions such as `DeleteCommand` or `FindCommand` which also uses index. It also reduces the need to type out
the full name of the selected athlete.

=== Undo / Redo feature
The `undo` command enables users to undo their previous commands while the `redo` command enables users to redo their
undone commands.

==== Undo Implementation

The `undo` command is facilitated by the `[green]#HistoryManager#`. `[green]#HistoryManager#` holds the
states of `[green]#Athletick#`, `[green]#Attendance#` and `[green]#Performance#`, which are kept in
their respective stacks governed by `[green]#HistoryManager#`. Furthermore, `[green]#HistoryManager#` also
holds the `[green]#Command#` stack that keeps track of the commands executed by the user.

Each time after the user executes a command, the command will be pushed to the
`[green]#Command#` stack. Also, following the execution of the command,
changes to either `[green]#Athletick#`,`[green]#Attendance#` or `[green]#Performance#`
will result in the new state being pushed into their respective stacks.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `[green]#HistoryManager#` will be
initialised with the initial `[green]#Athletick#`, `[green]#Attendance#` and
`[green]#Performance#` state pushed to the respective stacks.

image::initialStack.png[width=450]

Step 2. The user executes the `delete -p 3` command to delete the 3rd person in the `[green]#Athletick#` list. The
delete command will be pushed into the `[green]#Command#` stack. After that,
since the `delete -p 3` command only alters the `[green]#Athletick#` state, the new `[green]#Athletick#`
state will then be pushed to the `[green]#Athletick#` stack while the `[green]#Attendance#` and
`[green]#Performance#` stacks are left untouched as their states remain the same.

image::afterUndoStack.png[width=450]

Step 3. The user now decides that deleting the 3rd person in the list was a mistake, and decides to undo the action
by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command then executes the `undo` method in the
`[green]#ModelManager#`. This pops the latest command from the `[green]#Command#`
stack and the latest `[green]#Athletick#` state from the `[green]#Athletick#` stack.
It then peeks at the `[green]#Athletick#` stack to retrieve the `[green]#Athletick#` state
before `delete -p 3` command was executed.

image::initialStack.png[width=450]

Step 4. After retrieving the `[green]#Athletick#` state before `delete -p 3` command
was executed, we then resets the `[green]#Athletick#` state to this retrieved
`[green]#Athletick#` state. As such, the previous command will then be undone.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::undoSQ.png[width=450]
Sequence diagram for undo implementation

==== Redo Implementation

The `redo` command is similarly facilitated by the `[green]#HistoryManager#`. `[green]#HistoryManager#`
also holds the undone states of `[green]#Athletick#`, `[green]#Attendance#` and `[green]#Performance#`,
which are kept in their respective undone stacks governed by `[green]#HistoryManager#`. Furthermore,
`[green]#HistoryManager#` also holds the undone `[green]#Command#` stack that keeps track of the commands
undone by the user.

Each time an `undo` command is executed succesfully, the undone `[green]#Command#` will be pushed
to the undone `[green]#Command#` stack and the respective undone states of `[green]#Athletick#`, `[green]#Attendance#`
or `[green]#Performance#`, if affected, will be pushed to their respective undone states.

Following that, how the `redo` command works is very similar to how the `undo` command works.
As such, you can also refer to the diagrams in the
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#undo-redo-feature[Undo
Implementation.]

The activity diagram for `redo` command is as follows:

image::redoactivity.png[width=450]
Activity diagram for `redo` command



==== Design Considerations
This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of the undo and redo features.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Keep states of `[green]#Athletick#`, `[green]#Attendance#` and
`[green]#Performance#`.|Alternative 2: Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself

|Pros
a|* Easy to implement, and easy for developers to understand.
a|* Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete -p 1`, just save the person being deleted).

|Cons
a|* May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
a|* We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

|===

====== Reason why we chose alternative 1:
Even though the memory usage of Alternative 2 is lesser, we do not feel that this benefit of lesser memory usage
outweighs the tedious cost of implementing the alternative.

Furthermore, as we realise that each time the application starts, the memories of the states
are cleared.
This means that the cost of having alternative 1 is significantly lesser, as the memories of the states do not
accumulate. As such, we
decided to
go with the first alternative.


=== Adding/editing photo feature
==== Implementation
The sub feature of `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` allows the inclusion of photo for an athlete. The sub feature is
facilitated by `Photo`.

This sub feature is similar to the other features such as `Name` and `Phone` which uses a prefix `i/` followed by the
file name (e.g. `i/default.png`). Prior to adding the photo of an athlete, the image file that is going to be used
has to be in the `images` folder which will be generated when the jar file is executed. `Photo` takes in the file name as a
`String` and retrieves the photo to be added or edited from the `images` folder.

NOTE: The file name of the images is restricted to alphanumerics only and the file format that will be used is `.png`.
This is done to keep the file name simple.

==== Design Consideration
The following consists of some of the design consideration when I was designing this sub-feature.

===== Aspect: Regular expression for the file name
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** To use alphanumerics only.
** Pros: Keeps it simple without the confusion of special characters.
* **Alternative 2:** Alphanumerics and special characters.
** Cons: These special characters are reserved used by operation systems such as Windows.

Reason: Alternative 1 was chosen because it simplifies the parsing of the filename and reduces the error it might
have if special characters were included.

=== Filter feature

The filter command enables filtering of athletes based on their tags.
Currently, only filtering by one tag is supported.
Filtering by multiple tags will be available by `v1.2`.

==== Implementation

Filter makes use of a `TagMatchesPredicate` class to determine if the athlete has tags matching the user input.
Given below is the Sequence Diagram to show how filter works, with an example input of filter captain.

image::filter_sequence_diagram.png[]

Once filtering by multiple tags is implemented, the parsing of tag from `AddressBookParser` to `FilterCommandParser` will involve splitting them by spaces and storing the tag queries in a list.
Thereafter, each tag query will be compared against every athlete’s tags to determine if the athlete should be filtered.

However, since currently only filtering by one tag is supported,
the parsing of tag simply involves trimming the tag of white spaces.

Finally, the list shown to the user is updated through `Model#updateFilteredPersonsList()`.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How a tag match is determined

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Case-insensitive.
** Pros: More user-friendly.
** Cons: Requires converting tags to lower-case on the back-end.
* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive.
** Pros: Allows for more accurate filtering.
** Cons: Difficult for users to search, as generally filtering and searching are case-insensitive.

===== Aspect: How matches for multiple tags are determined

* **Alternative 1:** Exclusive matching.
** Pros: Allows for more accurate filtering.
** Cons: Users get fewer filter results.
* **Alternative 2:** Optional matching.
** Pros: Allows for more flexible searching.
** Cons: Users may get results that they are not interested in.

=== Sort Command

The `sort` command sorts the displayed list of athletes in alphabetical order. As new athletes are added to the bottom of the list, the `sort` command is used after to reorder the athlete list.

==== Implementation

The `sort` command makes use of a `[green]#PersonNameComparator#` that orders athletes in alphabetical order by comparing their names. The comparison is case-insensitive.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort` operation works:

.Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `sort` Command
image::SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon completion of the above execution, the sorted list of athletes would be displayed immediately to the user.

To support sorting by more attributes (e.g. attendance rate/performance) in the future, you can simply create a new class that implements the `[green]#Comparator#` interface which compares athletes by that attribute instead. After which, you have to edit the `sort` command syntax to allow users to indicate how they want their list to be sorted.

==== Design considerations

This section contains some of our design considerations for the sort command.

===== Aspect: When should the athlete list should be sorted

[width="100%", cols="1, 5, 5"]
|===
||Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Sort address book after user issues the `sort` command|Alternative 2: Sort address book persistently in alphabetical order

|**Pros**
a|* Allows users to view their newly added athletes at the bottom of the list which is more user-friendly especially when the list of athletes is very long
 * Allows for future expansion of sorting by other attributes (e.g. performance scores) easily as we only have to create new comparators to order the athletes
a|* Automates sorting so users do not have to issue any commands

|**Cons**
a|* Requires additional overhead in terms of having to create an additional command for users to issue
a|* Restricts users from sorting their list by other methods
* Limits feature's further expansion by future developers

|===

**Reason for choice of alternative 1:**

* Alternative 1 allows users to view their newly added athletes to ensure their details are correct before they are sorted into their correct positions alphabetically. This is important especially when the athlete list is very long.
* Alternative 1 abides by our design principle to keep **Athletick** designer friendly since future developers can expand upon it to allow sorting by other attributes. On the other hand, alternative 2 does not provide much room for future expansion.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `[green]#config.json#`).
