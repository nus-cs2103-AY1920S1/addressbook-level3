    "description": "This module introduces students to the theoretical underpinnings of statistical methodology and concentrates on inferential procedures within the framework of parametric models. Topic include: random sample and statistics, method of moments, maximum likelihood estimate, Fisher information, sufficiency and completeness, consistency and unbiasedness, sampling distributions, x2-, t- and Fdistributions, confidence intervals, exact and asymptotic pivotal method, concepts of hypothesis testing, likelihood ratio test, Neyman-Pearson lemma. This module is targeted at students who are interested in Statistic and are able to meet the prerequisite.",
