    "description": "This course seeks to explore the role of political leadership in economic policy and performance. It starts with a discussion of politics at the central level and introduces the merits and problems in the Chinese economic context. Students will be exposed to two major debates about control mechanisms in managing central-local relations: fiscal decentralization and promotion tournament. They will critically engage these two theories by examining some recent empirical works. This course concludes with four important issues facing today\u2019s Chinese economy: urbanization, pollution, financial policy and corruption. Students will gain insights about policies that are crucial to China\u2019s future growth.",
