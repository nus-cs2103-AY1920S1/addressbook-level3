    "description": "With the creation of colonial states in Southeast Asia, certain peoples in the region became minorities owing to their languages, religious beliefs or customary practices. Examples include the Shan and Karen in Myanmar, Muslim minorities in Myanmar, Thailand and the Philippines, the people of the Mountain Province in the Philippines, Christian communities in Indonesia, the hill peoples of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, and animist groups in Borneo and the Eastern archipelago. Colonial administrations often made special provisions for these minorities, but with independence the dominant ideology across the region called for a single national identity within each nation-state. This course examines the position of minorities under colonial and post-colonial governments. It surveys the minorities of the region, and develops case studies dealing with selected groups. This course is designed for students throughout NUS with an interest in history.",
