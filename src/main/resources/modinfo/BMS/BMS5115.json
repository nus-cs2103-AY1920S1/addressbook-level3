    "description": "In business, everybody negotiates. Every strategy and transaction will have to be implemented through strategic negotiations with other stakeholders. In fact, holding any executive position is essentially about the identification and management of different interests, which also requires an understanding of negotiation, mediation, and persuasion processes. Moreover, most NUS students will at some time in their future career find themselves in a negotiations and sales role; either as entrepreneurs in their own firms, or as managers. The course is run as a series of interactive seminars and negotiations exercises, combined with reading and reflection assignments distributed throughout the module.",
