    "description": "Oceans cover most of the globe. Yet once we venture from the shore, our understanding of the marine environment is necessarily mediated by technology, from the plumb line used by sailors for millennia to measure the water\u2019s depth, to the latest satellite imaging tracking ocean currents in real time. This module examines how different 'machines,' or technologies have produced understandings of the ocean across history, and places these technologies in their social, cultural, economic, and political contexts. The result is to reveal the complex and evolving interconnections that link technology, and society and our understanding of the natural world.",
