    "description": "The past two decades have witnessed the emergence of new forms of international organizations (e.g. Basel Committee) alongside traditional organizations (e.g. WTO). These new organizations challenge the traditional premises of international law. Moreover, international organizations increasingly issue rules that impact people around the world, yet they largely operate within a legal void and go unchecked. In view of these challenges, a new legal school of thought is emerging that seeks to set more legal constraints and that introduces institutional reforms, such as the growing inclusion of Asian countries in international organizations. We will explore these issues.",
