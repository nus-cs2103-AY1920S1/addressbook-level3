So you've decided to put your gym membership to use and want to plan your next workout regime. Head down to the
workout planner tab to create your custom workouts and track your progress!

But wait! I have no idea how to begin with this, you may be thinking. Fret not, read further to see a breakdown of the
workout planner screen and what you can do with it!

==== Workout Planner Screen

Alright, I'm now at the workout screen! What's next?

.Workout Screen
image::workoutScreen1.png[]

As seen in the screenshot above, the Workout Planner screen is similar to the other screens, with the main
difference being the list of Exercise cards and Workout Cards. Not too sure about what to work on or need suggestions?
Workout Planner begins with prebuilt Exercises and Workouts installed to get you started.

Over on the left, is the list of Exercise Cards. Each card informs you of the name, primary muscle as well as the
intensity of the exercise. To get more information of the exercise, you can use the view command which will be covered
in section 3.7.3 of the User Guide.

Similarly on the right we have the list of Workout Cards. The Workout Cards shows the Workout name, the number of
Exercises in the workout as well as the last time the workout was ran. You can also tell the intensity of the
workout from the image of the card.

.Low Intensity Card

.Medium Intensity Card

.High Intensity Card
image::workoutHighIntensity.png[]

Similarly, to find more information on the workout, you can use the view command which is covered in a later
section of this User Guide.


==== Adding an exercise: `add exercise`
"I now know the components of the Workout Planner! So what can I do with it?"

Well I'm glad you asked kind person! To start off, we have the add exercise command which creates new
exercises for your workouts. To add an exercise, you must first specify its name, primary muscle trained as well
as its intensity. You can also add optional fields such as secondary muscles and exercise details like sets and reps.
The following shows all the possible fields that can be added: +
* Name +
* Primary Muscle +
* Intensity +
* Secondary Muscles (optional) +
* Number of sets (optional) +
* Number of repetitions (optional) +
* Timing (optional)  +
* Distance (optional) +
* Exercise Weight (optional) +
To add the exercise, simply input the fields in the Command Box in the following format: +
Format: `add exercise n/EXERCISE_NAME p/PRIMARY_MUSCLE sm/SECONDARY_MUSCLE i/INTENSITY
s/SETS r/REPETITIONS d/ DISTANCE w/WEIGHT t/TIMING`

Examples:

The following images show an example of the command being inputted and its corresponding
outputs.

.Example input

.Example output

==== View Exercise: `view exercise`

Ok, now that you've added your exercise, you probably want to know what all of its details. Simply
input the command `view exercise` followed by the index of the exercise you want
to view as shown below.

.Example Input
image::viewExerciseInput.png[]

The screen should now show the full details of the exercise in question. Let's get you up to
speed with what's what.

.Exercise Details Screen
image::viewExerciseOutput.png[]

1. Basic Details +
The first segment comprises of the basic details of the exercise. This includes the Exercise
Name, Intensity, Primary and Secondary Muscles, Number of times the exercise has been executed,
Average Run Time of the Exercise as well as some of its details.

2. Previous Attempts +
Next up we have a history of all the previous attempts of the exercise. This includes the workout
that the exercise is done in, the time it was done as well as the time it took. It also specifies
the number of sets attempted and completed.

The details on this page is automatically updated with each workout run. To return back to
the exercise page, simply invoke the `goto exercise` command.

More statistics as well as graph view will be implemented in version 2.0.

==== Find Exercise:

Now that you have a sizable amount of Exercises, you realise that you cannot easily find them
amongst the sea of cards. To tackle this problem of seamless navigation, we implemented the
find command.

Find Exercise works in 3 ways:

* By Name
* By Muscles Trained (inclusive of both primary and secondary muscles)
* By Intensity

To use the following command, simply type `find` in the command box followed by the variant
you wish to utilise and the predicate.

* To find by name, the variant word is `exercise`
* To find by muscles trained, the variant word is `exerciseMuscle`
* To find by intensity, the variant word is `exerciseIntensity`

.Find by Exercise Name
image::findExercise.png[]

.Find by Muscles Trained
image::findExerciseMuscle.png[]

.Find by Intensity
image::findExerciseIntensity.png[]

The filtered lists will then be shown as follows:

.Find Output
image::findExerciseOutput.png[]

To show every exercise again, simply invoke the `list exercise` command.

==== Add Workout: `add workout`

Now that you've created all your exercise, you're ready to create a workout plan! To create
a workout, input `add workout n/NAME` into the command box, replacing `NAME` with the name
of your workout. This will initialise your Workout with no exercises in it.

.Add Workout Input

.Add Workout Output
image::addWorkoutOutput.png[]

==== Push Exercise `push exercise`

Once you have initialised your workout, you are now ready to add your exercise into your
workouts! To do so simply locate the index of the exercise you want to push and the workout
you want to push your exercise into. Then input the command in the following format `push
 exercise wi/WORKOUT_INDEX ei/EXERCISE_INDEX`.

.Pushing Bench Press into Chest Day
image::pushExerciseInput.png[]

For example, if you want to add Bench Press exercise into Chest Day workout, type in
`push exercise wi/4 ei/8` in the command box as seen above. You will get the following input.

.Push Exercise Results
image::pushExerciseOutput.png[]

Now that you know you know how to push exercises, you can go ahead and add in all the exercises
needed for your ULITMATE workout regime!

==== View Workout: `view workout`
You've created your workout regime, but you're unsure of the details and your progress. With
the `view workout` feature, you can check all the details of your workout as well as its
history!

Similar to `view exercise`, type in `view workout` followed by the index of the workout you're
interested in. So if you want to view 'Chest Day' you can follow the image below.

.Viewing Chest Day Workout
image::viewWorkoutInput.png[]

The following screen will now appear. To orientate you, here are the components of the screen:

of the workout. You can also return to the workout planner page with `goto exercise`.

==== Run Workout: `run workout`

You've created all your exercises and added it into your ultimate workout. Now you're ready
to run it! To run the workout, invoke the `run workout` command with the index of your
ultimate workout.

.Run Workout Window

The window above will pop up upon inputting the command. The window can be broken down into 5
major segments which are :
