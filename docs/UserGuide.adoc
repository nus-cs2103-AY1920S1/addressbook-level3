== Introduction

*MYMorise -- Manage Your Money(MYM)* is a desktop application for those who *prefer tracking personal expenses on their
computers*. With MYMorise, you can easily see your daily expenses as well as a summary, along with other useful
functionalities. More importantly, MYMorise is *optimized for those who prefer to work with Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface
(GUI)*. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

****
*Things to note in MYMorise:*

* Expense - refers to the cost incurred in or required for something which the user would like to record
* Budget - refers to an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.
* Default expense list - refers to all expenses that do not fall into any budgets in MYMorise.
* The amounts used in MYMorise can only work for numbers up to 2 decimal places.
* MYMorise's GUI consists of 3 display panels:

    The left panel - displays all expenses recorded in MYMorise. User commands do not reference from this panel and should not be made based on this panel. Commands made should reference from the centre panel. The purpose of this panel is solely for displaying all expenses recorded only.

    The centre panel - displays the current view requested by user. All commands made are in relative to the content displayed in this panel. That is, if a user enters the command `listBudgets` or `view 1`, this panel will reflect the content requested. Subsequent commands such as `editExpense` and `editBudget` will reference from this panel. On start up, the centre panel displays the default expense list.

    The right panel - displays the visual graphics of the content shown in the centre panel only.

=== Automatic currency conversion for foreign currencies

to Singapore Dollars (SGD). The conversions are done in the following scenarios:

* When an expenses specifies a currency that is not the default currency
* When an expense specifies a currency that is different from that budget it is associated to.

This automatic conversion allows for the computation of budgets and expenses regardless of their underlying currencies to provide
a cleaner experience when viewing budgets and expenses with multiple differing currencies.

The latest Foreign Exchange data for a limited set of supported currencies are updated whenever the application is launched. The list of supported currencies are as follows:
