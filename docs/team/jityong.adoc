== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 3


=== Overview

The purpose of this document is to showcase my contributions to SecureIT, a project developed by my team under the
Software Engineering module (CS2103T) in NUS. In this module, my team and I were tasked to enhance a basic command line
interface desktop application called _Address Book 3 (AB3)_. We have decided to morph AB3 to become our current product - SecureIT.

Below is a snapshot of how SecureIT looks like!

=== About this Project
SecureIT is a secure information management system that enables office workers to securely manage confidential data such as
passwords, notes, files and credit card information completely offline.
Users are able to interact with SecureIT via the Command-line Interface (CLI) which requires them to issue commands
to the application in the form of successive lines of text.
My role in this project was to design and implement all features related to notes within SecureIT.

In this document, I will be providing detailed descriptions and explanations to showcase
my contributions to SecureITâ€™s key features.

=== Summary of contributions
* *Minor Enhancement*: Added *the ability to open a note*
** What it does: gives users the ability to open a note and edit it through the User Interface(UI).
** Justification: This feature helps reading and editing notes in the app much easier, which is useful for an enhanced
user experience.
** Highlights: To implement this feature, an additional UI panel was created to display the note.
This UI panel allows users to freely edit the note's contents and save the changes back to the note.
The implementation was challenging because it required thorough understanding of how the UI interacted with the other components
for this to work.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo and redo previous commands*
** What it does: gives users the ability to undo and redo commands one at a time.
Undo command undo the last undoable action.
Redo command restores any actions previously undone by the undo command.
** Justification: This feature serves to be extremely important because users tend to make mistakes and the app should provide them
with an easy way to undo their mistakes. This helps to enhance the user experience and can save users precious time and energy used
to amend their mistakes manually.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a good understanding of data structures and algorithm to be able to come out with a
clean and intuitive solution.
This enhancement also required a thorough understanding of how the components interacted with each other as it had to integrate
with several commands.
