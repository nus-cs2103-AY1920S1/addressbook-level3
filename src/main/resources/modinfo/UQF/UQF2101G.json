    "description": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. This module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks. Students will pose a question related to nuclear risks (e.g. What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer?), propose a method to measure the relevant variables, collect the necessary data, and make scientifically justifiable inferences from it. Students will thus perform all aspects of a genuine scientific study, from problem formulation to decision making and final reporting.",
