    "description": "Process Analysis and Redesign is a systematic approach to helping an organization analyze and improve its processes. In this course the term \u2018redesign\u2019 includes \u2018reengineering\u2019. All systems are designed and developed to support business processes. Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an 'As-Is' and 'To-Be' model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations. Case studies will provide real-world context for the concepts discussed in class. The course is designed to teach students BPR methodologies and modeling techniques that accompany the methodology. Students will identify an organization (or part of an organization) that needs improvement. Next, they will analyze the current system, investigate possible Information Technology and operational solutions, redesign the current system and propose a plan to move from the 'As-Is' system to the 'To-Be' system.",
