=== Budget Bar display

The budget bar display provides a graphic overview of meals consumed on the current day,
comparing against the total calorie budget set by the user.

==== Implementation

The budget bar feature is implemented via the `BudgetBar` class.
It is a JavaFx UI component, which wraps around `MealLog` and `CalorieBudget`.
`MealLog` provides an observable list of meals eaten today,
while `CalorieBudget` provides the currently set user budget.

Using helper code from `ObservableUtil` and `ObservableListUtil`,
we compute several derived properties:

* Total calories consumed
* Percentage of budget consumed

From there, we again construct further observable/reactive values representing:

* Bar info text color
** Transitions from green to red, when more budget is consumed
* Bar info text
** If budget has been set, shows `<Total Consumed> / <Budget>`.
** If budget has not been set, only shows `<Total Consumed>`.
* Meal segments
** Each meal is displayed as a proportionally-sized segment in the whole bar.
* Position of warning/danger markers

The following activity diagram shows the reactive update dependencies.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Base UI component to display meal segments.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**
  Use ControlsFx's `SegmentedBar` class to handle display of bar segments.
** Pros:
*** No need to reimplement JavaFx `setLayout` logic
*** Better performance than `GridPane`
** Cons:
*** Dependency on external library
*** Have to create a separate `BufferSegment` class to represent gap.
* **Alternative 2:**
  Use JavaFx's `GridPane` to lay out bar segments, and `ColumnConstraints` to appropriately set column widths.
** Pros:
*** No external library (other than JavaFx) needed
** Cons:
*** Poor performance to due `Observable` machinery and `GridPane` layout
* Explanation of choice:
  Simpler implementation and better performance outweighs the cost of using an external library.
