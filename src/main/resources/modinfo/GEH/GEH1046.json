    "description": "What is the power of artistic images? How do images express ideas and feelings? How are images controlled and used to control or influence people in different societies? How do images become sacred or lose their sacred potential? How do images function in rituals? The module explores the ways visual images are produced, used, exploited, and transformed in different societies. The class attempts to answer some of these questions through looking at the social life of visual images across cultures and time periods.",
