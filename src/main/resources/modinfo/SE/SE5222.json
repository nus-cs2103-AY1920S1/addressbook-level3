While the different art practices, notions, institutions, and art worlds discussed in the module may be labelled traditional, tribal, modern, or contemporary, none of these terms fully expresses how each artistic phenomenon continues the artistic/cultural history of the region and at the same time is part of the contemporary artistic, cultural, and social landscape. The module explores these and other issues through studying specific cases. The focus is on the present, but historical background will important to understanding the current situation.",
