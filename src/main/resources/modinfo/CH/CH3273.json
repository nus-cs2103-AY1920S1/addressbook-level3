    "description": "This course surveys the development of Chinese popular literature from late Qing Dynasty to the present by tracing the transformation of three themes in vernacular fiction: martial arts, court romance, and science fiction. Through reading some of the most important works of the period, discussing the movies and TV dramas based on them, as well as examining how the Chinese literary landscape was shaped by the shift in medium of transmission from paper to the Internet, students will develop analytical skills in critically reflecting upon the modernization of Chinese literature. This module is taught in Chinese.",
