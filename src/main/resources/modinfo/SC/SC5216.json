    "description": "This module presents a social history of the development of criminological thinking and contemporary criminological models in explaining crime, particularly sketching the influence of social sciences, in the way criminals and crime, are being viewed in contemporary society. But the study of crime, criminality, victimization and social policy is not dispassionate; it is inextricably linked to notions of social order and social control. The course, thus, will attempt to show that it is difficult, if not impossible, to study crime without examining the underlying assumptions and perspectives which account for how we come to regard crime as a phenomenon.",
