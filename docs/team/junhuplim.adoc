== Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio showcases my contribution to the Athletick project.

=== About the team

We are a team of five year 2 computing students from National University
of Singapore with diverse backgrounds. Four of us are majoring in Computer
Science with different specialisations and one of us is majoring in Information
Security.

=== About the project

This project is a 6 weeks long project for our software engineering module.
We were tasked to either enhance or morph a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop
Address Book application and one of the main constraints of this project is that
the application has to remain as a command line interface.

What my team and I decided to do was to morph the existing address book application to a team
management desktop application called Athletick. Athletick is designed for captains and
coaches of timing-based performance sports to help take and keep track of attendance
and performance of their teams.

Some of the main features of Athletick include:

* Taking and tracking of team's attendance.
* Recording and tracking of team's performance.
* Viewing of training calendar and performance graph.
* Viewing of an athlete's profile.
* Undoing and redoing of commands.

This is what users see when they first launch Athletick:

My role was to design and implement the code for the `undo` and `redo` features.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as
well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

[horizontal]

NOTE: This symbol indicates important information

`command`:: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be typed into the command line and executed by the application.

`[green]#component#`:: Green text with grey highlight indicates a component, class, object or method in the architecture of the application.


== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.

 * What it does: The `undo` command allows the user to undo a previous command. The user may
reverse this `undo` command with the `redo` command.
 * Justification:
In the event that users have made a mistake or changed their minds about executing
a command, the `undo` command enables them to revert to a version immediately before the mistaken command
was executed. If they change their minds again and decide to execute the command after all,
then the `redo` command enables them to do so easily.
 * Highlights:
** This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands.

** As there were a few ways to implement this enhancement, an in-depth analysis of design
alternatives was necessary to weigh the different alternatives and decide on the implementation for this enhancement.

** The implementation too was challenging as it required a full understanding of
the major components of the application and the existing features implementations.
Also, as the enhancement is able to work with future commands, the implementation of
this enhancement has to be considerable of the future features implementations and
allow the future enhancement for such features to be easily integrated into the current implementation.
