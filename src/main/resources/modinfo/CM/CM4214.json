    "description": "This module covers the commonly used methods to determine the structure of inorganic and organometallic compounds including symmetry operators, point groups and irreducible representations; Raman or IR active vibrational modes; the principles and theories of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques; assessment of quality of published crystal structures; NMR as a powerful diagnostic tool to determine structures and fluxional mechanisms. High resolution mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopy may be introduced.",
