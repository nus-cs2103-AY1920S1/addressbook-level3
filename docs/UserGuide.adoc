== Introduction

PalPay is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing personal finances*.
More importantly, PalPay is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, PalPay can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
This User Guide is written for the users of PalPay as an introductory document of the application.
You are strongly encouraged to read this document before using the application to enjoy the full functionality of the application.

=== Splitting a Bill with Friends : `split` [Work in Progress]

Split a bill with your friends +
Format: `split $/AMOUNT n/NAME1 [n/NAME2]... [s/SHARE]...`


* `[SHARE]` defines portion of bill to be paid by each person
** if no shares are given, `amount` will be split evenly across all people, including user
** user is included in the bill if number of shares is *1* more than number of people
*** user's share will be the first listed share
** each person's share is assigned in order
*** i.e. last person's share is the last share listed
** shares cannot be negative numbers

Examples:

* `split $/1000 n/Amy n/Betty n/Catherine n/Dan`
** $1000 is split equally between Amy, Betty, Catherine, Dan and the user.
* `split $/100 n/Albert n/Bernard n/Clement s/2 s/1 s/7`

* `ITEM` input accepts the description of the expenditure
* `DATE` accepts the date of this transaction
* `CATEGORY` accepts the CATEGORY for this expenditure
* `in` will update the Bank Account with a net **negative** amount (e.g. `out n/milk $/2 d/10102019` will **decrease** Bank Acount balance by $2)
****

=== Setting a Budget : `set`

You can set a budget for a particular category until a certain date, given it is not a duplicate.
A duplicate budget is a budget with the same `AMOUNT` and `DATE` and `CATEGORY`. +
If you attempt to do so, you will receive an error message: `This budget already exists in the bank account`. +

Format: `set $/AMOUNT d/DATE c/CATEGORY`

****
* `AMOUNT` input accepts the new budget amount to be set. This amount must be non-negative, non-zero and
less than 1,000,000.
* `DATE` input accepts the deadline to be set. It cannot be a date in the past.
* `CATEGORY` accepts the CATEGORY for the budget. A budget can be created without any `CATEGORY`.
****

Example: Let's say you want to restrict your spending for a certain category until a certain deadline.
PalPay allows you to set a budget and serve as a reminder to show how much of the budget set you have left
until the deadline. (V1.4) You will be more self-conscious of your spending and minimise your spending by setting a budget. +

To set a new budget: +
1. Type `set` and enter the relevant details (amount, deadline, category) in the format given above. +
2. The result box will display the message "New budget successfully set". +
3. If the budget already exists in the budget list, the result box will display the message "This budget already exists". +
4. Now you can see the newly set budget in the budget list. +
