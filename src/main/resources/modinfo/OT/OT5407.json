    "description": "This course will provide basic as well as advanced concepts related to Geomechanics and Rock Mechanics issues in the exploitation of Oil and Gas Petroleum. Topics covered will include: 1) Fundamentals of Petroleum Geomechanics, with review of rock strain and stress, impact of fluid pressure; Rock deformation and failure; deformation of natural fractures and stresses in depth earth. 2) Rock mechanical characterisation, from laboratory core testing to field data collection. 3) Key subsurface processes involving the principles of Geomechanics \u2013 borehole stability while drilling, predicting rock failure behaviour during production, analysis of reservoir compaction and subsidence, mechanics of injection from hydraulic fracturing in unconventional resources to waterflooding in deep water reservoirs.",
