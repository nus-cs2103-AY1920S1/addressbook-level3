    "description": "One of the best ways to understand the essence of poetry is to write one\u2019s own composition. This method is particularly important in the study of classical Chinese poetry, for it can practically help one acquire the knowledge of tones, prosody, forms, structures and aesthetics of this traditional literary genre. Through critical analysis of Tang-Song masterpieces and traditional poetry discourses, this module will introduce the skill of poetry writing to students, deepen their understanding of the art of classical shi poetry as well as the historical, social and cultural backgrounds related to the genre\u2019s stylistic development, and nourish their aesthetic criticism on poetry as a whole.",
