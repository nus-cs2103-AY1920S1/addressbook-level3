== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

[.text-center]
.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

[.text-center]
.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

[.text-center]
.Structure of the UI Component
image::NewUiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ReminderPanel`, etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
Other UI parts such as HelpWindow, VisitRecordWindow, are not displayed as UI elements in the MainWindow but opens up through a command entered.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[.text-center]
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

[.text-center]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::NewModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences, alias and appointments.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
[.text-center]
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

[.text-center]
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::NewStorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/unrealunity/visit/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `unrealunity.visit.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[aliasImplementation]]
// tag::alias[]
=== Alias feature
==== Implementation
The alias mechanism is facilitated by `AliasTable`. At a lower level, saving of aliases is facilitated by use of a `HashMap`.
It is contained within `UserPrefs` and can be serialized together with the rest of the members in `UserPrefs`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AliasTable#applyAlias(commandText)` -- Applies the longest stored aliases to the supplied command.
* `AliasTable#addAlias(alias, aliasTo)` -- Adds a new alias to the alias table.
* `AliasTable#removeAlias(alias)` -- Removes a existing alias from the alias table.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#applyAlias(commandText)`, `Model#addAlias(alias, aliasTo)` and `Model#removeAlias(alias)` respectively.

The following sequence diagram shows how adding an alias works:

[.text-center]
image::AddAliasSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The check for and illegal alias consists of creating a new `AddressBookParser` and parsing the given alias into it, which is not shown in this diagram.

The `unalias` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#removeAlias(alias)` instead which calls `Model#UserPref(alias)` and `AliasTable#removeAlias(alias)`

The following sequence diagram shows how applying alias works:

[.text-center]
image::ApplyAliasSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
This is a generalized diagram which depicts what happens between `execute(commandText)` and `LogicManager#parseCommand(alias)`. This process is not shown in other sequence diagrams.

A user-defined alias is considered a match with the user input if the alias is a substring, that starts from the beginning, of the user input. Specifically, `AliasTable` uses the regex `(ALIAS)($| ).*` to check if it is a match. Following that, it picks the longest matching alias to apply to the user input.

The following activity diagram shows how applying alias picks which alias to apply:

[.text-center]
image::ApplyAliasActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
An unfortunate side effect to matching the longest matching macro increases the time complexity of this operation to O(n) from O(1) if we used wholesale matching instead.

// end::alias[]

[[appointmentsImplementation]]
// tag::appointments[]
=== Appointments feature
==== Implementation
The Appointments feature comprises of Reminders and Follow-Ups. Users can create a generic Reminder to be notified of an ongoing "something to take note of", such as a hospital being closed. Follow-ups are used to plan future visits to patients. Both Reminders and Follow-ups are represented by the `Appointment` class, but are facilitated by the `AppointmentList` class for UI updates and `AppointmentTable` class for JSON updating.

[.text-center]
.Appointment Class Diagram
image::DGApptAppointmentClassDiagram.png[]

[.text-center]
.AppointmentList Class Diagram
image::DGApptAppointmentListClassDiagram.png[]

[.text-center]
.AppointmentTable Class Diagram
image::DGApptAppointmentTableClassDiagram.png[]

The `AppointmentList` and `AppointmentTable` are similar and run the same operations in parallel. This is a constraint due to how data is stored into JSON by the underlying program, and is on the timeline to be converged in v2.0. Due to their similarities, we will only look at `AppointmentTable` for the sake of this documentation.

It implements the following operations:

* `AppointmentTable#getDefaultAppointments()` -- Returns a default, empty `AppointmentTable`.
* `AppointmentTable#getAppointmentList()` -- Returns an `ObservableList` version of the Appointments for UI usage. This is necessary as `AppointmentTable` is loaded on launch and `AppointmentList` uses this data to propagate the UI.
* `AppointmentTable#addAppointment(type, description, days)` -- Adds a new Appointment.
* `AppointmentTable#deleteAppointment(description, days)` -- Deletes an appointment from VISIT.
* `AppointmentTable#antiDuplicate(check, description, days)` -- Checks if the Appointment already exists. Returns true if there is no duplicate, false if there is a duplicate.
* `AppointmentTable#sortAppointments()` -- Sorts the list of appointments by days remaining, then name.
* `AppointmentTable#cascadeDay(days)` -- Decrements the days an Appointment has left. Run on application launch by `UserPrefs` after calculating days elapsed.
* `AppointmentTable#outputAppointments()` -- Outputs the Appointments to readable String.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface.

The following sequence diagram shows how adding an appointment works, using reminders as an example:

The following activity diagram shows how adding an appointment works, using follow-ups as an example:

[.text-center]

image::DGApptFollowUpActivityDiagram.png[]
// end::appointments[]

[[profileImplementation]]
// tag::profile[]
=== Profile feature

==== Implementation

The *Profile feature* allows the user to be able to *see the full details of the patient* as well as all relevant visit information (See <<visitImplementation, Visit Implementation>>) from a single panel. Attributes of the patient is extracted from the `Person` instance, including the `Name`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Tags` and `VisitList`. The Profile feature also enables users to *export the Profile as a read-only text file* for archiving.

===== *Profile Panel Implementation:*
_The displaying of the patient profile panel is mainly facilitated by the following components:_
****
- `ProfileWindow` - Displays the relevant information of the Patient on the Profile Panel.
* `#setup` - On invocation, populates the Panel with the given `Person` instance.
- `ProfileCommand` - Instantiated when the command is parsed by `ProfileCommandParser`.
* `#execute` - Extracts the Person from the current model.
- `ProfileUtil` - Utilized during `ProfileWindow#setup` to translate the various `Person` attributes to `Strings` (stringify).
****
Given below is a simple example usage scenario demonstrate how Profile feature behaves and interacts with the other components:

*1*. The user executes `profile 3` command view the profile of the 3rd person shown in VISIT's current list. This is parsed as a `ProfileCommand`, which is then executed.

*2*. The `Person` instance from the filtered Person list from the current `model` and returns a `CommandResult` with the `Person` instance as an attribute.

*3*. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` is then executed, calling `ProfileWindow#setup()` which populates the hidden Profile Window with the attributes of the `Person` instance before `MainWindow#handleProfilePanel()` is called to show the Profile Window to the user.

[.text-center]
.Activity Diagram for Steps 1 - 3
image::Profile0.png[width="350"]

*[4]*. In this optional step, users can choose to export the Patient's Profile as a .txt file by pressing the `p` key or clicking on the _Generate Profile File_ button on the UI. The implementation of this is detailed in the next section.

*5*. After viewing the relevant information, the user presses the 'esc' key which closes the form. This causes an event handler in `ProfileWindow` which listens for a `KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED` event where the event code equates to `KeyCode.ESCAPE` ('esc' key) to trigger, which hides the profile window.

[.text-center]
.Activity Diagram for Step 4-5
image::Profile1.png[width="350"]

[NOTE]
The user is able to close the `ProfileWindow` form by clicking the 'x' on the top right of the form as well.

This sequence diagram fully shows what happens when a user executes the Profile Command:

[.text-center]
image::ProfileSequenceDiagram1.png[]

===== *Profile Generation Implementation:*
_The patient profile generation functionality is mainly facilitated by the following components:_
****
- `ProfileWindow` - Serves as origin for invoking the `GenerateProfileCommand` using `#generateProfilePressed`.
- `GenerateProfileCommand` - Instantiated by `ProfileWindow` with the relevant `Person` attributes.
* `#execute` - Uses `FileUtil` and `ProfileUtil` to build the contents of the Profile .txt file and create it in the relevant directory.
****

The following is a scenario to illustrate the behaviour of how this functionality works:

*1*. The user presses the `p` key or the _Generate Profile File_ button on the Profile Panel. This invokes the `generateProfilePressed()` in `ProfileWindow`.

*2*. This generates a new `GenerateProfileCommand` instance relating to the `Person` that `ProfileWindow` is currently on. This command is then executed using the same `LogicManager` as `ProfileWindow`.

*3*. The executed command uses `FileUtil` to generate the parent file (_generated_profiles_) if it has not been created.

*4*. `ProfileUtil` is invoked to assemble a `String` containing the entire content of the `ProfileWindow` in a presentable manner.

*5*. `FileUtil` is then called again to generate a read-only .txt file containing the file content. A `CommandResult` indicating success is the propagated back to `ProfileWindow`.

*6*. Upon success, a small message is generated next to the _Generate Profile File_ button on the Profile Panel.

This simplified sequence diagram summarizes the critical interactions between ProfileWindow, GenerateProfileCommand, FileUtil and ProfileUtil:

[.text-center]
image::ProfileSequenceDiagram2.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Profile shows the information from the patient in ProfileWindow
`ProfileWindow` currently uses the `Person` class as its data structure to access all the relevant information on the Profile Panel. This presents some design considerations as listed here:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not create an explicit `Profile` class to store the Profile data.
** Pros: Easy to implement, more straight forward implementation. Defensive copies of Person can be used instead of a explicit `Profile` class which contains the exact same field variables as a Person.
** Cons: May cause dependency issues as this increases coupling, with relation to the Profile and Patient class.
* **Alternative 2:** Create an explicit `Profile` class, which is instanced every command call.
** Pros: Decreases coupling by cutting down on the direct calls to the `Person` instance.
** Cons: Adds to bloat in code structure, as it is very similar to `Person` class. We must ensure that the `Profile` instance generated is correct every time.

// end::profile[]
[[visitImplementation]]
// tag::visitationreport[]
=== Visitation Report feature
==== Implementation

The Visitation Report feature allows the user to `add`, `delete` and `edit` a `VisitReport` such that for every housecall, information like the prescription and diagnosis can be stored. Every `Person` has a `VisitList` attribute and each `VisitList` object contains an arraylist of `VisitReport` objects. The feature is facillitated by `VisitRecordWindow` which creates a form for the user to key in the details of the report, `VisitListPanel` which creates an indexed pop up list of visit reports for the user to check the index of the report they want to edit/delete and `SaveVisitCommand` which saves the users input from the form. The following operations are also implemented:

* `VisitList#addRecord()` -- Adds new `VisitReport` object to stored arraylist
* `VisitList#editRecord()` -- Replaces `VisitReport` object at given index in arraylist with given `VisitReport`
* `VisitList#deleteRecord()` -- Deletes `VisitReport` by index from stored arraylist

The class diagram below shows the new additions to the Person class.

[.text-center]
image::VisitClass0.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how every component of the Visitation Report feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addvisit 5 v/12/12/2019` command to add a visit report to the visitlist of the 5th person in the address book. This returns a  `CommandResult` which has the attribute `date` set as String `12/12/2019`. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called and the check for `CommandResult#isAddVisit()` passes, calling  `VisitRecordWindow#setReportInfo()` to pass the `index` of the person, the `date`, and a `Logic` object to initialize the respective attributes in the `VisitRecordWindow` class. `MainWindow#handleShowVisitForm()` is then called to display a pop up form for the user to fill in.

[.text-center]
.Activity diagram to illustrate all possible variations of Step 1
image::AddVisit0.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user executes `addvisit 5` instead, the `date` attribute of the `CommandResult` will be set as the current date and the rest of the flow remains the same.

Step 2. The user fills in the form and presses `f2` on the keyboard or clicks the `submit` button to save the report. This calls `VisitRecordWindow#saveReport()` which will create a new `SaveVisitCommand` and executes it, updating the `VisitList` of the person via `Model#setPerson()`.

Step 3. The user decides to edit the report and executes the `editvisit 1 i/1` command.`MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called and the check for `CommandResult#isEditVisit()` passes, calling  `VisitRecordWindow#setOldReportInfo()` which initializes the respective attributes of `VisitRecordWindow` and populate the form with the content of the `VisitReport` from  `CommandResult#getOldReport()` .`MainWindow#handleShowVisitForm()` is then called to display a pop up form for the user to fill in.

[.text-center]
.Activity diagram to illustrate all possible variations of Step 3
image::EditVisit0.png[]


As shown in the figure above, if the user executes `editvisit 1` instead, a `CommandResult` with a `ObservableList<VisitReport>` object will be returned. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` 's check for `CommandResult#isShowVisitList()` passes, calling `VisitListPanel#setup()` which populates the `VisitListPanel` with the contents of the `ObservableList<VisitReport>` object from `CommandResult#getObservableVisitList()`. Instead of displaying the pop-up form, `MainWindow#handleShowVisitList()` is called to display a pop up list showing an indexed list of all visitation records of the person.

Step 4. The user edits the form and presses `F3` on the keyboard or clicks the `submit` button to save the changes. The same mechanism mentioned in `Step 2` is used to update the contents of the edited visit report.

The sequence diagram below shows how Step 3 and Step 4 works.

[.text-center]
.`EditVisitCommand` and `SaveVisitCommand` sequence diagram
image::EditVisit1.png[]

Step 5. The user then decides that the report was beyond salvaging and decides to delete it. Executing the command `deletevisit 1 d/1`, `VisitList#deleteRecord()` deletes the entry from the arraylist and `Model#setPerson()` updates the person with the new `VisitList`. The `CommandResult#isShowVisitList()` check in  `MainWindow#executeCommand()` passes and a pop up list showing an indexed list of all visitation records of the person is displayed.

[.text-center]
.Activity diagram to illustrate all possible variations of Step 5
image::DeleteVisit0.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user executes `deletevisit 1` instead, the index value will be set to `-1` and the `VisitList#deleteRecord()` block would be skipped, but the rest of the flow remains the same.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Range of acceptable dates for `addvisit`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow dates with years 19xx or 2xxx
** Pros: Prevents user from keying in rubbish dates like year 9999 or 0000
** Cons: Must conduct 2 checks for date in parser, one for the format dd/MM/19yy and one for the format dd/MM/2yyy.
* **Alternative 2:** Place no restriction on valid years
** Pros: Only one check for dd/MM/yyyy format is required.
** Cons: User can key in rubbish values like dd/MM/9102 or dd/MM/0192

===== Aspect: Keyboard binding to save report

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `F2` key
** Pros: No conflict with any other functions.
** Cons: Not the most intuitive choice for users.
* **Alternative 2:** `Enter` key
** Pros: Very intuitive choice for saving.
** Cons: It's also used to get to the next line, thus using it as the save button means users can no longer press `Enter` for next line
// end::visitationreport[]

[[uiImplementation]]
//tag::guiredesign[]
=== GUI Redesign
The GUI Redesign is done to include the new features made for the VISIT application, as well as improve the overall
user experience with a easily readable interface that displays every important information in a glance.

==== Current Implementation
The current redesign of the GUI includes the addition of:

* the `ReminderPanel` to display upcoming appointments
* the `VisitListPanel` to display the visit reports stored in a patient's profile. (as mentioned in Visitation Report feature)
* the `VisitRecordWindow` form for the user to enter the required information. (as mentioned in Visitation Report feature)
* the `ProfileWindow` to display the full profile information of a patient.
* the `MotdWindow` to display the appointments in a new window. Motd stands for Message of the Day.

In addition to these, VISIT's CSS theme is updated to fit current standards of GUI design,
with a more pronounced color palette and a clearer font.

The following is the snippet of the class diagram of the Ui Component with the new Classes:

[.text-center]
image::UiRedesignClassDiagram.png[]

1. The `MainWindow` has been new panel which is the ReminderPanel.
2. Three new Windows, `VisitRecordWindow`, `ProfileWindow` and `MotdWindow`, are in use in addition to the MainWindow.
These windows are opened through their respective commands.
3. `ReminderCard` and `VisitCard` gets its data from Model, similar to PersonCard.

==== Future implementation `[Coming in v2.0]`

For future GUI design considerations in v2.0 and above, the panels of each feature such as `PersonListPanel` and `ReminderPanel` can be
separated by tabs, through a dashboard interface. This allows more information to be displayed within each tab, allowing
users to work with more data.

//end::guiredesign[]

[[logImplementation]]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
