    "description": "Geographers have contributed much to understandings of urban lives, landscapes and processes. Urban Space: Critical Perspectives explores this contribution in two interrelated ways. First, through an examination of key themes in geographical analyses of cities and urban regions. These range from housing and infrastructure provision to mobility and labour market issues. And, second, through an engagement with diverse histories and geographies of cities. This involves a questioning of the spatiality of urban processes in various regions of the world, interrogating Euro-American-centred conceptions of urbanization and discussing alternative perspectives. The module thus examines both urban geographies and geo-histories of 'the urban'.",
