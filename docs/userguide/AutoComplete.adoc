*Autocomplete*

As a community nurse, you will be performing several commands through the Command Line Interface (CLI). In order to speed up the process, the application includes an autocomplete feature that allows you to more quickly and conveniently input your commands and parameters. This section describes the feature in further detail.

=== Viewing list of suggested words
To the right of the command box, there is a panel that has a list of suggestion words. The suggestion list will be constantly updated to fit your input. +

=== Updating list of suggested words
The suggested list of words in the autocomplete panel will be updated as you type in the command box. The panel will only suggest to you words that you need, based on your input and your previous word selection. Should your input be wrong or does not match any of the suggested word, no words will be suggested to you. +

*Eg:* +
If "visit-" is your input in the commandbox, only words that are related to "visit" will be suggested such as "start" and "end". +

If "visit-s" is your input in the commandbox, only words that starts with "s" and is also related to visit such as "start" will be suggested. +

*Note:*

- When prefixes are suggested, you should select all prefixes that you need then type in the required sub-details +
Eg: Select all prefixes "pat-add n/ p/ e/ a/ t/" before adding sub-details "pat-add n/John p/98762615 e/john@example.com a/exampleaddress t/exampletag vt/examplevisittodo"
 - If no words appear in the autocomplete panel, this can only mean 2 things: +
1) Your full command is finished, there are no more words to be suggested. +
2) Your input is wrong and does not match any of the words to be suggested. (Try to change your input by backspacing)

=== Selecting a suggested words
`*UP*`, `*DOWN*` key +
You can use the `*UP*` and `*DOWN*` keys in your keyboard to move from one selected word to another. Descriptions of the suggested words will be shown as you select them to guide you in choosing.

`*SHIFT*` key +
Confirm your selection by pressing the `*SHIFT*` key in your keyboard. This will auto-fill the selected word to your current words in the command box text field. +

*Eg:* +
Selecting the "now-update" in the autocomplete panel will concatenate with "now-update" with "visit-", the current text in your command box.

*Note:* +
When pressing `*UP*`, `*DOWN*`, or `*SHIFT*` keys, make sure that the command box is selected.
