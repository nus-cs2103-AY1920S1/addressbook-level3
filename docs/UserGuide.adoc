`add-d` command does not work unless it is typed after `add-task` and `yes`. +
Either deadline or member or both can be added using the `add-d` command. However at least one attribute must be present. +
Remember to input deadline using the 24 hour time format of dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm

Example:

* `add-task tn/Finish Portfolio s/unbegun tt/Education`  +
A new task will be added to the project dashboard, which prompts a sequence of questions, as shown in the following pictures

** First, type the `add-task` command

image::ml-task_2_1.PNG[width="500"]

** This prompts the feedback asking for your choice to add deadline and member

image::ml-task_2_2.PNG[width="500"]

** Type `yes` to add deadline or member

image::ml-task_2_3.PNG[width="500"]

** This prompts to add the details

image::ml-task_2_4.PNG[width="500"]

** Type `add-d at/10-12-2019 18:00 mi/AR` to set deadline at 10-10-2019 18:00 and assign the member with member id “AR” to the task.

==== Changing a task status to done: `done-task` +
[IMPORTANT]
only for tasks that are tagged “Inventory”

As mentioned in the earlier part of user guide, to change the task status to “done”, use the `done-task` command in the format below. If the task is tagged as "Inventory", this will result in a series of questions that allow you to add the task as an inventory. The following flowchart shows this series of feedbacks from the application and user inputs.

image::ml-task_3.PNG[width="500"]

Format (for done task): `done-task [ti/TASK_ID]` +
Format (for yes): `yes` +
Format (for no): `no` +
Format (to add price and member): `add-i [p/PRICE] [mi/MEMBER_ID]`

[NOTE]
`add-i` command does not work unless it is typed after `done-task` and `yes`. +
Unlike `add-task`, in this case both attributes price and member id are required.

Example:

* `done-task ti/8` +
The task with index 8 will have its task status changed to done. Since the task is tagged as “Inventory”, this will prompt a series of questions, as shown in the pictures below.

** First, type `done-task ti/8`

image::ml-task_4_1.PNG[width="500"]

** This prompts the feedback asking for your choice to add it as an inventory.

image::ml-task_4_2.PNG[width="500"]

** After typing `yes` as the user input, feedback will prompt you to add the details.

image::ml-task_4_3.PNG[width="500"]

** Type `add-i p/5.50 mi/AB` to set the price at $5.50 and to assign the member with member id “AB” to the inventory

image::ml-task_4_4.PNG[width="500"]

** This sets the price and assigns the member successfully! You should see a window like this.

== FAQ

*Q*: Can I use file formats other than ics for the calendar feature? +

*Q*: What if the calendar cannot find a timing where everyone is free? +
*A*: There will be a list showing the number of available members for the time period you specified, so it will be easier for the user to choose the best possible your meeting.


*Q*: My project has a budget, does the application help me keep track of the projects financial status? +
*A*: Using /inventory the application can keep track of current expenses for each task and the member who purchased it, however, there are currently no accounting services available.

*Q*: Some of the tasks for my project require sub tasks to be completed, is there a way to add them? +
*A*: Ideally since the user is the project leader, they should only see the main tasks to be accomplished for the project. This would help facilitate their managerial role within the project. Hence, the application does not support subtasks.

*Q*: How can I add multiple members to the same task? +
*A*: You can use the `assign` command detailed in in <<Member Commands>>.

*Q*: What happens when a task has been completed? +
*A*: You can mark the task as `done`, which will move the task to the `done` portion of the dashboard. In the case where you do not want to keep the task in the list, using ‘Remove Task’ will delete it.
