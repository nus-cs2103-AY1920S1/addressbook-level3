    "description": "The self image of human beings as morally responsible agents to which praise and blame may be legitimately ascribed, entities to which autonomy and dignity might be attributed, appear conditioned upon our having a robust freedom to will and to do. But do we really have such a freedom? And just what is presupposed in\nthe area of free will by our practice of assigning moral responsibility to each other in the first place? Through discussing a series of seminal writings on the topic, the student is introduced to the philosophical controversies in the area of freedom and moral responsibility.",
