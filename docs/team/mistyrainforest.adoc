== PROJECT: Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)

---

== Overview


.Sample User Interface of MAMS

image::Ui.png[height=50%]

Every semester, administrators from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have to
systematically work their way through a heavy backlog of special requests, known as "appeals".
These appeals are usually made by frantic students during Module Registration,
a system where students register for their
desired courses in the upcoming academic term, and represent special circumstances that require
human judgement to resolve.

**The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)** is hence a desktop app that aims
to fuse a Command Line Interface (CLI) style command input with a triple-pane
GUI for easy navigation of appeals, module information, and student
particulars all in a single display. By combining the precision and speed of a CLI
input with the powerful side-by-side overview afforded by a GUI,
this app is particularly aimed towards *appeal
administrators who prefer to blaze through their heavy backload of appeals
without ever having to leave the comfort of the keyboard for their mouse*. MAMS aims
to be a self-contained application for fetching appeal, module, and student information, while
providing a complete suite of tools for intuitive navigation of the comprehensive data display and
resolving appeals. These include, but may not be limited to:

- A *powerful side-by-side triple-pane list cell display of appeal, module, and student data*, with commands to quickly navigate between
compact list views of multiple items and comprehensive expanded displays of single items.
- A *command history feature* for administrators to quickly cycle through and re-use old commands, while providing a comprehensive
and permanent log of all actions performed within the application.
- A *clash feature* that allows administrators to accurately determine any potential timetable clashes in appeal cases,
student workloads, or any two particular modules.
- A *find feature* that enables administrators to quickly locate specific appeal, module, and student data, narrowing down clutter within the display.
- An *add/remove module feature* that allows administrators to allocate or remove modules from students, while automatically checking for
potential hiccups like duplicate assignments.
- An *approve/reject feature* that allows administrators to close or resolve appeals in fast succession, and even provides functionality for mass operations.
- A *set credits feature* that provides administrator with the functionality to override allowable student workloads.
- An *undo/redo feature* to correct any recent unwanted data changes that may have been accidentally committed by the administrator.

MAMS is written primarily in Java, and features a GUI created with JavaFX, with CSS used to augment the GUI for improved user experience. It has about
13 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to backup and restore previous states of the application*
** What it does: Allows users to save a snapshot of the current state of the application and restore any prior states that were saved.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might have need to rollback several changes in case a critical error in the system occurs further down the road. This gives the users the security that progress is saved and previous mistakes can be rectified with ease.
** Highlights: This enhancement saves the states in the same format as the main data file, which allows for users to easily port their save states to other compatible platforms that support the editing of the module appeal data.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: Allows the user to undo one previous commands. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects current commands, requiring commands that are not "undoable" to be specifically excluded from the creating an undo history, so that only a commands that affect the state of the system is taken into account when undoing commands. An alternative implementation should be considered if there is a need to include many more "undoable" commands.
** Credits: Code from the backup/restore commands were used as a basis for the undo/redo command pair.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a setcredits command to manually set the maximum credits that a student is allowed to take for the semester.
