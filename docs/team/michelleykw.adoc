== 1. Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my roles and contributions to the project, in terms of the code, the User
Guide and the Developer Guide.

In a team of 5 software engineering students, we were tasked to enhance an existing desktop application,

engineering project. We chose to morph it into a watchlist for movie and television series called

=== 1.1. About EzWatchlist

EzWatchList is a Command Line Interface desktop application, which means that it is designed for those who types fast
and prefer to execute commands through typing. It helps users, especially those who are forgetful, to keep track of the
shows they had watched or wish to watch, reducing the hassle of having to search for shows frequently.

|===================================

=== 1.4. Role

My role was to implement the `search` feature and ensure proper documentation of the code. I had to implement the
`search` feature such that users would be able to search when online and offline. The
code had to be refactored and the `search` command had to be modified to allow users to search for different
categories such as searching by show name, actor or genre.

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project. +

=== 2.1. Major Contributions
*Enhancement added: Implemented the `Search` command* +

* *What it does*: The `search` feature allows users to search for shows, from the online database, offline database, their watchlist or watched-list.
Users can search for shows based on the show name, genres or actors and filter based on the type and where the show is found at.
* *Justification*:The `search` feature enables users to find new shows online easily or check if they had watched a certain show.
* *Highlights*: This enhancement requires a change on how `SearchCommand` process the search method and additional integration with the API.
