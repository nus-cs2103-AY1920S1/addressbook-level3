    "description": "This GE module introduces the diversity of human cultural experience in the contemporary world. It offers an anthropological lens for understanding cultural diversity with concrete cases. We will read articles and analyse ethnographic films on kula exchange, cannibalism, oracle, feud, animism, sacrifice, initiation, incest, spirit-possession, statelessness, potlatch, genocide, and so on, found in Melanesia, Amazonia, sub-Sahara, Siberia, Zomia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. We will gain a sensitivity toward stereotypes and ethnocentrism, understand the connections and processes that shape social life at different levels, and learn the skills to appreciate and analyse differences in the changing world.",
