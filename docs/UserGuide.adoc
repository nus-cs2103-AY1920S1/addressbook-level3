== Introduction
Welcome to the user guide for _TravelPal_!

What is _TravelPal_? First and foremost, it is a cross-platform desktop application for those
who love to plan and micromanage their travels. It includes various features that can make trip planning hassle free,
such as an itinerary, inventory, bookings and expense manager.

During the trip, there is also an inbuilt diary application that
allows you to record details of your travels, so that you can review them later or share them with loved ones!

In addition, we have made the Command Line Interface (CLI) the primary preferred form of input, but alternative
Graphical User Interface (GUI) inputs are also supported for most operations.

Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `TravelPal.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for _TravelPal_.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

[[command_tips]]
========

*General Command tips*

* Most commands are in the form: `<command word> <argumentWithoutPrefix> <argument1WithPrefix> <argument2WithPrefix> <argumentNWithPrefix>`
* `<command word>` is case insensitive, so typing it in any combination of UPPER_CASE or lower_case will work.
* Leading and trailing white spaces in the inputted command are ignored.
* `<argumentNWithPrefixes>` consists of two parts, namely a `prefix/` followed immediately by an `argument`
** `prefix/` s are some combination of letters, followed by a `/` character, and are case sensitive

========

=== Trip manager

The __Trip Manager__ page is the main starting ground of the application. Here, you can view and enter the trips you have created.

If you are using TravelPal for the first time, you will see a blank page, to create a new trip, please follow the instruction in <<Trip setup>>.

After a trip is successfully added, information about the trip is shown in a trip card as shown below.

image::TripManager.png[]

On the __Trip Manager__ page, the following command are available:

* `create` : creates a new trip, this command brings up the trip setup user interface.
* `delete <index of trip>` : deletes the trip with the specified index and all data associated with it.
* `goto <index of trip>`  : enters the main page of a trip with the specified index.

=== Itinerary
==== Introduction
__Itinerary__ is a series of features that allows the user to manage and view their __Trips__. The 2 main aspects that __Itinerary__ covers are :

* *Itinerary Management* : How to access information about each trip?
* *Itinerary Administration* : How to edit information about each trip?

_Itinerary_ provides an intuitive and efficient way to achieve both goals.

==== Basic Structure Overview
The structure of _Itinerary_ is modelled after that of a regular travel itinerary.
The following gives the basic understanding of how _TravelPal_ for better understanding of further sections:

* *Trip*: Each _Trip_ is divided into _Days_ which are automatically generated upon creating a _Trip_
* *Day*: Each _Day_ consists of several _Events_. Events are created and editable by the user.
* *Event*: _Events_ are the smallest unit of planning in _TravelPal_

NOTE: _Trip/Day/Events_ created by you should not clash with another _Trip/Day/Event_ of the same type

With a basic understanding of how the basic structure of _Itinerary_ is like, you are now ready to use the user interface!

==== Itinerary User Interface Overview
_Itinerary_ consists of 5 pages:

1. *Itinerary Page*: Displays basic information of your _Trip_
2. *Days Page*: Displays the _Days_ in your selected _Trip_
3. *Events Page*: Displays the _Events_ in your selected _Day_
4. *Edit Day Page*: Displays a form where users can create/edit their _Day_
5. *Edit Event Page*: Displays a form where users can create/edit their _Event_

image::ItineraryTree.png[title="Pages in an Itinerary. (Black arrow denote common navigation between two different pages)"]

The accessibility between pages is intuitively based on the specific user's focus. For example, in the figure above, each vertical column represents a user's focus. From column 1 - 4, the user's focus switches from each _Trip_ -> _Day_ -> _Event_.

NOTE: The commands related to each page in _Itinerary_ are separated and the same command produces different results on different pages.

[[itinerary_page]]
===== Itinerary Page
The _Itinerary_ page is the home page of your _Trip_. From this page, you can access your _Days_ and details for each _Day_. Below is layout of the user interface:

image::ItineraryOverview.png[title="Layout of the _Itinerary_ page"]
NOTE: You can access other pages from the _Itinerary Page_ using te navigation feature(<<navbar_usage>>).

[[days_page]]
===== Days Page
The _Days_ page is a view of the _days_ in your trip. It consists of a grid of _day_ thumbnails arranged based on chronological order (earliest on the top left to the latest on the bottom right). Below is the layout of the the _days page_:

image::DaysPageOverview.png[title="Layout of _Days Page_"]
Each _day thumbnail_ (refer to Figure 4) contains basic information of your day and an edit button which allows you to edit that specific _day_ (refer to <<day_setup>>). Below is a layout of the contents in a _day_ thumbnail:

image::DayThumbnail.png[title="Layout of the day thumbnail in _Days Page_"]

[[events_page]]
===== Events Page
The _Events_ page is a view of the _events_ in your trip. It consists of a list of event cards (see Figure 6.) arranged from earliest to latest in chronological order (earliest on top and latest below). Below is the layout of the _events page_:

image::EventsPageOverview.png[title="Layout of _events page_"]

Each card contains the basic details of each event. You can execute show command to display details of the event (refer to <<show_event_details>>). The layout of the event card is as shown.

image::EventCardLayout.png[title="Layout of _event card_"]

NOTE: The index of the event card is used to access its contents for any command involving events (e.g. <<event_setup>>, <<delete_trip_event>>)

// tag::teoha_ppp[]
==== Trip setup
Trip setup is the first step in configuring a new/existing trip! This requires you to be at the __Trip Manager__ page (the landing page).

image::TripManager.png[title="User Interface of  __Trip Manager__", width=500]

*Step 1*: Now you can enter the command `create` or `edit <index>` to create a new trip or edit an existing trip.

Upon commands to create or edit a specified trip from the Trip Manager, you will be directed to a page where they can edit the necessary details to create a new trip. This page will contain a form with 6 fields (optional fields are marked by italics):

* *Name*: Name of the trip
** *Constraints*: Names should only contain up to 40 alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank
* *Start Date*: Starting date of the trip
** *Constraints*: Start date should be in the DD-MM-YY format

image::createTrip.png[title=" `create` command generates empty fields, width=500]

* If the `edit` command was executed, you will be displayed a from with details previously filled in instead:

image::editTrip.png[title=" `edit` command generates fields from your previously saved data, width=500]

*Step 3*: Now that you are on the edit page, to edit a specific field, execute the following command: `edit <prefix>/<value> <prefix>/<value> ...`. There are 6 different prefixes. The 6 prefixes refer to editing each fields as follows:

1. Name :  `n/`
2. Start Date : `ds/`
3. End Date : `de/`
4. Total Budget : `b/`
5. Destination : `l/`
6. Photo File Path : `fp/`


NOTE: You can execute `fc/` with `fp/` to open a file dialog to choose an image rather than type in absoulute path of the image.
e.g. `edit fp/ fc/`

Below is an example execution of changing the name of an existing trip to "Small Trip":
====

- Begin at the edit trip screen, the original name of the trip is the same as before.

image::editTrip.png[title="Edit page with original fields", width=500]

====

*Step 4*: Having completed editing the the form, you can submit it by executing the `done` command or the `cancel` command which will confirm your edit or discard it respectively.
You have successfully created/edited a trip!

// end::teoha_ppp[]
[[event_setup]]
==== Event Setup
Creating/editing an event is similar to creating/editing a trip (directly above). To do so you have to begin on the events page displaying the list of events of a certain day (Fig. 13).

image::eventsPage.png[title="Events Page layout", width=500]

*Step 1:* Now you can enter the `create` or `edit <index>` command to create a new trip for edit an existing one. The `<index>` to enter can be referenced from the list of events being displayed on each card. (Refer to <<events_page>> or Fig.14 below)

image::eventsIndex.png[title="Index used to execute commands", width=500]

Upon execution of either command on the events page, you will be directed to a page where editing the necessary details to create a new event is possible. This page contains a form with 4 necessary fields and 3 optional fields (optional fields are marked with italics).

* If the `create` command was executed, you will be displayed an empty form with details to be filled in by you for the first time. The empty form looks like this:

image::createEvent.png[title="Empty event form", width=500]

* If the `edit <index>` command was executed, you will be displayed a form filled with details that you have previously entered. An example is shown below (Fig. 16):

image::editEvent.png[title="Form with previously saved information", width=500]

*Step 3*: Now on the _edit events page_, to edit a specific field, execute the following command: `edit <prefix>/<value> <prefix>/value> ...`. There are 8 different prefixes to edit one of the 7 fields displayed. The 8 prefixes are as follows:

1. Name : `n/`
2. Start Time : `ds/`
3. End Time : `de/`
4. Total Budget : `b/`
5. Destination : `l/`
6. Description : `d/`
7. Add an inventory item to the event's inventory list: `inv/<name of inventory item to add>`

- Enter the command `edit l/Hotel 89` into the command box and press enter to execute

image::editLocation.png[width=600]

- You should now see the text in the field **Destination** change to "Hotel 89" to reflect the changes made to the event.

image::editResult.png[width=600]
====
*Step 4*: Now you should have completed all the necessary fields and are ready to finish the edit. You can execute the `done` or `cancel` commands to either confirm the edit or discard it. Both commands will redirect you back to the events page.

Congratulations, you have created/edited an event!

[[delete_trip_event]]
==== Deleting an Trip/Event
Deleting a Trip/Event is executed in exactly the same way as each other. You first have to begin on the Trip Page//Events Page respectively. Each of the pages will show a list of trips/events each labelled by an index. Below are 3 different list format elements and the indication where you can find the index.

image::indexExamples.png[title="Examples of different indexes displayed"]

NOTE: You should have at least 1 trip/event in your lists or all delete commands will be invalid

*Step 1*: Enter the command `delete <index>` into the command box  where the index corresponds to the trip/day/event you wish to delete. Press enter to execute the command.

image::deleteCommand.png[title="Example deletion of trip 1"]

*Step 2*: You should now see that trip/day/event that you deleted has disappeared from the list and the indexes have been reassigned in chronological order:

image::deleteResult.png[title="Result of executing `delete 1`"]

Congratulations, you have deleted a trip/day/event!

[[show_event_details]]
==== Showing Event Details
The details of each event are displayed on the right half the **Events Page**. You can access the events page by using the navigation feature (<<How to navigate>>) found on most pages.

Upon accessing the events page, the information panel on the right should be empty except the prompt "Click on an event to show details here!". The left panel holds the list of events in the particular day in chronological order.

image::eventsPage.png[]

To show the details of an event, execute the command `show <index>` in the command box. You should use the index on the event card in the command.

image::eventIndex.png[]

After executing the command, you should see the details of the event show up on the information panel. Below is an example execution of the process to show the information of the event "Breakfast:

- Starting from the events page, type the command `show 1` into the command box and press enter to execute.

<<Diary User Interface Overview>>.

[[diary_edit_view_annotated]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_edit_view_annotated.png[title="Overview of diary user interface when the edit box is shown"]

===== Diary Edit Box
This is the text edit area that allows a convenient form of alternative input to commands for editing the Diary Entry.
While you may feel that the special clauses _"<images 2>"_ and _"<images 5 1 3 4>"_ being used in the diagram above are
rather unfamiliar, they are actually quite simple! (see <<Diary Text>>).

TIP: For the command line input savvy users, you can use the `F1` accelerator to quickly move your keyboard focus
back to the command line input!

===== Commit Edit Button
This is simply the button-equivalent of the `done` command (<<diary_done_command>>), and allows you to commit the
changes you made (either through commands, or directly in the edit box) while the edit box was open.

[[diary_text_info]]
==== Diary Text

The **diary text**, as you edit in the edit box (<<Diary Edit Box>>), or edit through the commands described in
<<Diary Commands>>, are one and the same **diary text!** Hence, any commands you input to edit the text are reflected into
the edit box automatically, and any edits you make to the edit box are considered by the commands.

The diary text consists of *paragraphs*, which are simply texts separated by new line / return characters.

NOTE: A paragraph of text need not span a minimum length, and can even be empty, as seen in the empty orange boxes
in <<diary_text_line_numbering_figure>>

Additionally, the diary text can use special clauses to display and format images, as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.

[[diary_text_line_numbering]]
===== Diary Text Line Numbering
Each **paragraph** of text as seen in the edit box or diary entry display (with optional accompanying image(s)) is tied to a
specific **line number**. This **line number** is simply determined by the order of the text paragraphs as shown
in <<diary_text_line_numbering_figure>>, from top to bottom.

[[diary_text_line_numbering_figure]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_what_is_a_paragraph.png[title = "Annotated highlights of paragraphs and their line numbers with alternating colours"]

This **line number** is used for several commands described in <<Diary Commands>>.

NOTE: The line numbers are trivial if using the edit box to edit text, as text editing is done directly on the **diary text**.

[[diary_text_displaying_images]]
===== Displaying images
There are currently two main formats in which you can display images inside the diary entry display.

Both of them use simple clauses that require the numbering of the photo as displayed in the gallery.

image::diary/userguide/diary_mini_gallery_edit_box.png[title="Example usage of `<images>` clause to display images as a mini horizontal gallery or inline image"]

====== As a mini horizontal gallery of images.
** Format: Use a diary **text paragraph** consisting of only the clause `<images number1 number2 numberN>`, where `numberN`
is the index of the photo as displayed in the gallery (<<diary_gallery_display>>).
** Example: `<images 5 1 3 4>` - displays a mini gallery with the images 1, 3 and 5 as shown in the gallery.

====== As an inline image with an accompanying paragraph of text.
** Format: Use a diary **text paragraph** consisting of your desired text, along with the clause
`<images numberN>`, where `numberN` is the index of the photo as displayed in the gallery <<diary_gallery_display>>.
** By default, the clause will place the image on the right, and the text on the left. You can include the `'left'`
word inside the `<images left numberN>` clause to reverse the order.


==== Diary Operations

The diary commands follow the same general format used by the rest of `TravelPal` (see <<command_tips>>).

[[diary_create_entry_command]]
===== Creating a diary entry
To start, you would want to create a new diary entry for a certain day. There are two options,
the former being the `create` command which offers slightly more flexibility.

====== Option 1: Using the `create <dayN>` command
* Usage: Creates a new diary entry for *any* specified day number.
* Arguments:
** `<dayN>` - Positive integer nth day of the trip, which has not yet been created, and is less than or equal to
the last day of your trip.

[[diary_create_entry_command_button]]
====== Option 2: Using the add entry button `+`

* Usage: Creates a new diary entry for the day right after the latest day's entry you currently have.

'''
====== Example Usage

Scenario: You already have entries for days 1 up to 8, and you want to create a new entry for day 9.

. Type in the `create 9` command in the command line input, then press the 'enter' key, or simply click the `+` button as shown
below.
.. For the add entry button `+` (<<diary_create_entry_command_button>>), since the current latest day's entry is day 8,
it would create an entry for the day right after that, which is day 9.
+
[[diary_create_entry_command_before]]
image::diary/userguide/diary_create_command_with_button.png[title="Example usage of creating a new diary entry for day 9"]

. That's it! the diary entry will be successfully created, and you will be brought to the new diary entry's screen without
having to navigate to it via <<diary_flip_command>> automatically.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_create_command_command_after.png[title="Example result of post diary entry creation"]

[[diary_flip_command]]
===== Navigating to a diary entry
Next, say you wanted to view or edit a different day's diary entry, be it during your trip, or long after the trip. There
are also two options here to suit your needs, both offering the exact same functionality.

====== Option 1: Using the `flip <dayN>` command
* Usage: Flips the diary to the diary entry of the day number specified.
* Arguments:
** `<dayN>` - Positive integer of the nth day's diary entry to flip to.

====== Option 2: Using the diary entry navigation bar
* Usage: Clicking the the button of with the day number of the diary entry in the navigation bar (<<diary_day_navigation_bar>>)
will flip to the diary entry for that day.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario: You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 9, which is empty, and you want to view the diary entry for day 3.

. You should type in the `flip 3` command in the command line input, then press the 'enter' key, or click the navigation button `3` for
day 3, as highlighted below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_flip_command_with_button.png[title="Example usage of flipping the diary to day 3's diary entry"]

. That's all! You will be brought to the entry for day 3, as shown below. You should see a brief confirmation message in
the command result box, and that the current day indicator will update accordingly (<<diary_current_day_indicator>>).

image::diary/userguide/diary_flip_command_command_after.png[title="Example result of after flipping back to the diary entry for day 3"]

// tag::diary_ppp1[]
[[diary_addphoto_command]]
===== Adding a photo
If you have just created a fresh diary entry, and you're wondering where to go next, then you
may want to start by adding your photos to display in the gallery (<<diary_gallery_display>>).

There are *3* ways for you to add a photo, the last option being the least flexible but also the fastest!

NOTE: In all options, the image file chosen should be of the file types `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`.



====== Option 1: Using the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` prefix
* Usage: Typing in the command `addphoto fp/<file path> [d/<description>] [dts/<date taken>]`, with the
arguments described below, will add the image located at the `file
path` on your computer to the gallery.
* Arguments:
** `<file path>` - Relative file path from the location of the _TravelPal's_ jar file, or an absolute file path. (see <<glossary>> for details of relative and absolute file paths)
** `<description>` (optional) - The description of the photo to be shown in the gallery, of maximum length 20.
If unspecified, the file name is used instead, shortened to the maximum length.
** `<date taken>` (optional) - The date taken of the photo, of the format `d/M/yyyy HHmm`.
If unspecified, the last modified date of the file is used instead.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario:

* You are currently viewing an empty diary entry for day 1 and you want to add a new photo.
* Also, you want to give the photo a custom description, but want to use the last modified date of the image file in your
computer as the date taken for the photo.
* Shown below is an example of the photo on your computer you want to add,
`snowymountains.jpg`, that is located in the same place as the _TravelPal_ application.

image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_filepath_directory.png[title="Example file directory structure of the TravelPal application and snowymountains.jpg" width="80%" align="center"]

. You should type in the `addphoto fp/snowymountains.jpg d/picturesque mountains` command in the command line input, and press the 'enter' key.
.. Here, the relative `<file path>` is simply the name of the file, `snowymountains.jpg`, since the image file is located in the
same directory as the _TravelPal_ application.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filepath.png[title="Example usage of the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` option"]

. That's it! The photo, with the specified description and last modified date will be added. You should see a brief confirmation message in
the command result box.
.. Additionally, there will be a auto-generated photo numbering, for use as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.

image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filepath_result.png[title="Example result of after executing the `addphoto` command with the `fp/` option"]

'''

====== Option 2: Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix
* Usage: Typing in the command `addphoto fc/ [d/<description>] [dts/<date taken>]`, with the optional
arguments described below, will open your system's dialog to choose an image file.
* Arguments (optional):
** `<description>` - The description of the photo to be shown in the gallery, of maximum length 20.
If unspecified, the file name is used instead, shortened to the maximum length.
** `<date taken>` - The date taken of the photo, of the format `d/M/yyyy HHmm`.
If unspecified, the last modified date of the file is used instead.

NOTE: Using both the `fc/` and `fp/` prefix will cause _TravelPal_ to ignore the `fp/` prefix!

====== Option 3: Using the `Add` button under the gallery display
* Usage: Clicking the `Add` button located under the gallery display area ( <<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will open your
system's dialog to choose an image file.
* If this option is used, then the `<description>` & `<date taken>` are not specifiable and will be auto generated as described above.

'''

====== Example Usage for `addphoto` command with the `fc/` option or `add` button
// end::diary_ppp1[]

Scenario:

* You are currently viewing the diary entry for day 1, which is empty, and you want to add a new photo using your system's
file choosing user interface, leaving the
application to generate the `<description>` and `<date taken>` fields automatically.
* Also, the image file you want to add is `snowymountains.jpg`, and is not located in the same place as the _TravelPal_ application.

. You can type in the `addphoto fc/` command in the command line input as highlighted in yellow below, and press the 'enter' key,
or you can click the `Add` button.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser.png[title="Example usage of adding a photo through the `addphoto` command using the `fc/` option, or the `Add` button"]

NOTE: In this example, the `<description>` and `<date taken>` fields are automatically generated. However, if you are using
the `addphoto fc/` command, you may specify them manually as described in <<Using the `addphoto` command with the `fc/` prefix>>

[start=2]
. Your system's file chooser user interface, which may look different depending on your operating system (windows / mac / linux) (see <<glossary>>)
will be opened, as shown below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_step2.png[title="Example file chooser user interface for the windows operating system" width="75%" align="center"]

. Next, you can simply use the file chooser user interface to choose an image located anywhere on your computer!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_step3.png[title="Example image file in the file chooser user interface to add" width="75%" align="center"]

. That's it! Your photo, with the auto generated image name and date will be placed into your gallery, and you will see a
confirmation message in the result display.
.. Additionally, there will be a auto-generated photo numbering, for use as described in <<diary_text_displaying_images>>.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_addphoto_command_filechooser_result.png[title="Result after choosing the image 'qidu_marketplace.jpg' in step 3"]


===== Deleting a photo
If you mistakenly added a photo to the wrong diary entry, or want to remove a certain photo from an entry, you can
use the `delphoto` command to do so.

====== Using the `delphoto <photo number>` command
* Usage: Deletes a photo, indicated by the specified photo number, as displayed by the photo's numbering in the gallery.
* Arguments:
** `<photo number>` - Positive integer number of the photo to delete, as shown by the numbering in the gallery (see <<diary_gallery_display>>).

'''
====== Example Usage
Scenario: You mistakenly added the photo 'qidu_marketplace.jpg' to your diary entry for day 1 when it should have been
added the day 2's diary entry.

. You type in the `delphoto 1` command to delete the image with the same `1` numbering as shown in the gallery, and
press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delphoto_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `delphoto` command to delete the photo with number 1"]

. Your photo will be deleted from the gallery, and a confirmation message will be shown!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delphoto_command_result.png[title="Result of `delphoto` command to delete the photo with number 1"]


'''

NOTE: The commands below are quick command line equivalents of editing the text in the edit box, as described in
<<diary_editor_display_mode>>.

TIP: If you execute any command that changes the diary entry's text while the edit box is open, then the command still
works and the save behaviour is exactly the same as described in <<diary_editor_command>>!. That is, your edits will
be not be committed until you execute the `done` command (see <<diary_done_command>>).

===== Appending to a diary entry
If you are currently viewing a diary entry, and know how to format the entry text (see <<diary_text_info>>),
then you could use with the `append` command to add a new paragraph of text.

====== Using the `append <paragraph>` command
* Usage: Adds a new paragraph of text as specified by the `<paragraph>` of text immediately after the the `append` command word,
at the last line as displayed in the diary entry (see <<Diary Entry Display Area>>).
* Arguments:
** `<paragraph>` - The paragraph of text to append, as described in <<diary_text_info>>.

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario: You are currently viewing your edited diary entry for day 3 of the trip, and want to quickly append a new
paragraph of text using the handy command line interface.

. You type in the `append` command, along with a simple line of text without images:
`append After an entire day's drive, we arrived at the bustling city of Tai Chung`, and then you press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_append_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `append` command to add a new paragraph of text to a diary entry"]
. That's it! Your new paragraph will be saved and displayed automatically as shown below.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_append_command_after.png[title="Result of `append` command to add a new paragraph of text"]

===== Inserting text in a diary entry
If you have a long diary entry, and want to insert a new paragraph of text between some existing paragraphs without
using the edit box (<<diary_editor_command>>), then you can use the `insert` command.

====== Using the `insert i/<lineNumber> d/<paragraph>` command
* Usage: Inserts a new paragraph of text at the specified line number.
* Arguments:
** `<lineNumber>` - Line number to insert the `<paragraph>` at, as described in <<diary_text_line_numbering>>.
** `<paragraph>` - The paragraph of text to insert, as described in <<diary_text_info>>.

TIP: If the line number specified is more than the current number of lines the diary entry has, it will quickly add
the required number of new paragraphs and insert the provided text afterward!

'''

====== Example Usage

Scenario: Your diary entry has a sizeable amount of text already present, but you want to add a few more details of your
day for the trip in between.

. You type the `insert i/5 d/We passed by quite a few more scenic places on the road, along 合歡山.` command to add some
text in between the existing lines 4 and 5, and press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_insert_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `insert` command to insert a new paragraph of text in a diary entry"]
. The new paragraph of text you type will be inserted into the entry!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_insert_command_after.png[title="Result of `insert` command to insert a new paragraph of text to a diary entry"]

===== Editing text in a diary entry
If you have written a sizable diary entry, and want to edit a certain paragraph of text, then you can use the `edit`
command to do so.

====== Using the `edit [i/<lineNumber>] d/<paragraph>` command
** Usage: Edits the entire diary text of the diary entry, or a line of text.
** Arguments:
*** `<lineNumber>` (optional) - Line number of the text line to edit, as described in <<diary_text_line_numbering>>.
*** `<paragraph>` - The new paragraph of text (as described in <<diary_text_info>>) to replace the existing paragraph or entire entry with.

TIP: You can use this as a quick way to clear the entire diary entry's text!

'''

====== Example Usage
Scenario: You discovered that you made a minor spelling error - 'ou' instead of 'our' in line 1 of your diary entry, and
want to rectify this.

. You type in the command `edit i/1 d/On the third day, we departed from the Hua Lian county and began our drive to Tai Chung.` command to fix the mistake in the first line, and press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_edit_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `edit` command to edit an existing paragraph of text in a diary entry"]
. The spelling error is gone, and you are shown the confirmation message!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_edit_command_after.png[title="Result of `edit` command to edit an existing paragraph of text"]



===== Deleting a paragraph of text in a diary entry
If you wrote some things in your diary entry that you later rather wish not be there, you can use the `delete` command
to delete a paragraph of text in the entry!

====== Using the `delete i/<lineNumber>` command
* Usage: Deletes the line of text at the specified line number.
* Arguments:
** `<lineNumber>` - Line number of the text line to delete, as described in <<diary_text_line_numbering>>.

'''
====== Example Usage
Scenario: You discovered that you made quite a few rather embarrassing, elementary spelling errors in line 1 of your diary entry.
You want to rectify this quickly, because your friend requested you share details of your trip with her.

. You type in the command `delete 1` command to delete first line entirely, and press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delete_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `delete` command to delete an existing paragraph of text in a diary entry"]
. The spelling error is gone, and you are shown the confirmation message!
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_delete_command_after.png[title="Result of `delete` command to delete an existing paragraph of text"]

[[diary_editor_command]]
===== Showing the edit box
As an alternative to commands that allow you to edit your diary entry, you can also use the edit box to do so, as described
in <<diary_editor_display_mode>>. Note that any edits through the edit box or command made while the editor was opened
need to be saved by using the `done` command or button (see <<diary_done_command>>).To show the editor, there are two equivalent options.

====== Option 1: Using the `editor` command
* Usage: Opens the text editor window and shifts the keyboard focus to it, if it is not already opened.

====== Option 2: Using the `Edit` button
* Usage: Clicking the `Edit` button located under the gallery display area (<<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will open the editor.

'''

====== Example Usage
Scenario: You have just begun writing your diary entry, and even though you are a command line enthusiast, you recall the existence of
command line text editors, such as _vim_, which can greatly improve the typing experience.

Thus, you opted for using the edit box to write your diary entry, instead of repeating the same commands multiple times.

. You type in the `editor` command, and press the 'enter' key.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_editor_command_before.png[title="Example usage of `editor` command to open the edit window"]
. That's all! The edit box is opened, and the keyboard focus is shifted to it.
+
image::diary/userguide/diary_editor_command_after.png[title="Result of `editor` command showing the opened edit window"]

TIP: In true command line fashion, you can still return the keyboard focus to the command line input without the mouse
by pressing the 'F1' key!

[[diary_done_command]]
===== Committing your edits
If you have the edit box opened, any edits you make, through commands or the editor, are not saved until you tell
_TravelPal_ to do so! To do this, there are two options, the first being the `done` command and the second being the
`Done` button.

====== Option 1: Using the `done` command
** Usage: Saves the text currently in the edit box to the diary entry, and closes the editor.
** Example: `done`

====== Option 2: Using the `Done` button
* Usage: Clicking the `Done` button located under the gallery display area (<<diary_gallery_button_bar>>) will similarly
save the changes you made while the editor was open, and close the editor.

=== Trip Inventory Manager

==== Introduction

TravelPal's __Trip Inventory Manager__ is an integrated inventory planning and management system. It displays all the inventory items required for your trip in an intuitive and simple manner. Thus, making packing for your next trip a super easy task!

There are two types of inventory items:

1. Event-specific inventory items (auto-generated from event)
2. Non-event-specific inventory items

This section of the user guide explains how to view and manage your inventory items using __Trip Inventory Manager__.

==== User Interface Overview

Shown below is the __Trip Inventory Manager__.

image::expense/userguide/InventoryManager.png[title="Overview of Trip Inventory Manager user interface"]


The __Trip Inventory Manger__ displays all your event-specific inventory items and non-even-specific inventory items in one table. To provide the best reading experience, __Trip Inventory Manger__ does not display duplicate names.

==== Commands

On the __Trip Inventory Manager__ page, the following command are available:

* `add <name>`: Adds a non-event-specfic inventory item with the name, <name>.

NOTE: <name> must not already exist in the __Trip Inventory Manger__

* `delete <index of inventory item>`: deletes the inventory item

NOTE: The inventory item to delete must exclusively be a non-event-specific inventory item. Otherwise, to delete it, you will have to delete the inventory item from all events it is inside.

* `check <index of inventory item>`: marks the inventory item as packed
* `uncheck <index of inventory item>`: marks the inventory item as not yet packed

// end::inventory_ppp1[]

=== Help
The help feature gives the user an avenue to find additional help. It consists of only one command `help` with no other fields.

NOTE: Help can be called from any page in _TravelPal_

Upon executing the command `help` the user is shown a link to the _User Guide_ (this document). A popup will appear containing the link to our _User Guide_:

image::help.png[title="The help popup",width=400]

=== Exit
Exiting the app is a simple task of closing the application safely. Enter the command `exit` into the command bar and press enter to exit _TravelPal_.

_TravelPal's_ window should close without any errors. Thank you for using _TravelPal_


== General info

====
* Save data:
** The data of the trips is saved in the data directory located in the data directory where the _TravelPal_ application file, TravelPal.jar is.
** The data is stored in a human readable json format, allowing manual editing of the data files using a separate text editor.
* Window size:
** You might have noticed that you cannot resize the _TravelPal_ application any smaller than a certain size (specifically, 800 x 600).
** _TravelPal_ was designed as a desktop application, hence many of its contents will not display correctly given too small
a window size.

====

[[glossary]]
== Glossary
* Relative file path - the file path from the directory of the _TravelPal_ application file. For example,
`.\sample_picture.jpg`  is an relative file path referring to an image file `sample_picture.jpg` existing in the same directory
as the _TravelPal_ application file.
* Absolute file path - the file path from your computer's root directory, which can vary from system to system. For example,
`C:\Users\Public\Pictures`  is an absolute file path from the root directory of your computer's `C:\` drive.
