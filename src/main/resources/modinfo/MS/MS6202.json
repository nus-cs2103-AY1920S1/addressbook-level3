    "description": "The module examines the nature of Malay elite and intellectuals in Malay history and evaluates their influence or impact on Malay society. This would be done through recourse to major theoretical studies on elite and intellectuals and their roles in society. As elite and intellectuals represent the more influential elements in their society, the module would also inquire into the contemporary problems of leadership and the development of democracy in Malay society and culture.",
