*Scheduler* is a desktop application for scheduling interviews. It matches interviewees with interviewers automatically through our robust algorithm so you don't have to.

If you are a secretary facing a headache on organising interview slots for your team, we offer just the solution for you. Simply import or input the available timings of both your interviewers and interviewees, and start scheduling those interviews right away!

For more information, please refer to our <<UserGuide#, User Guide>>. Developers, please refer to our <<DeveloperGuide#, Developer Guide>>.

This application was developed by a team of students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) as part of the CS2103 Software Engineering module. <<AboutUs#, Read more about us>> or <<ContactUs#, contact us>> directly.
