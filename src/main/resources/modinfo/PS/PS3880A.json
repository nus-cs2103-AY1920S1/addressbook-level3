We will survey the growth of critical consciousness from 1890 to the May Fourth Movement, the rise of and reactions to Communism, and the revival of Confucianism in the 1970s and after. We will consider such questions as: what concerns preoccupy Chinese political thinkers of this period? What is the value of Chinese traditions for thinking critically about China's political future? How can Chinese political thought be understood to have global relevance?",
