    "description": "The trust is a distinctive and unique combination of proprietary rights and obligations and the objective of this course is to introduce students to the law of trusts and the principles of equity which have been influential in shaping that law. At the end of the course, students should be able to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the notion of an equitable proprietary interest under a trust and of the manner in which the trust strikes a balance between the respective interests and rights of settlor, trustee and beneficiary. Students should also be able to demonstrate an appreciation of the importance and flexibility of constructive trusts as well as related equitable doctrines and remedies in the modern law. The course will be taught in two sections. Each section will have its own syllabus and methods of assessment which may not coincide.",
