    "description": "This module teaches the necessary analytical knowledge and practical skills for improving decision-making processes in engineering and business environments. This is achieved by providing a paradigm based on normative decision theory and a set of prescriptive tools and computational techniques using state-of-the art software with which a stake holder can systematically analyze a complex and uncertain decision situation leading to clarity of action. Topics from utility theory and influence diagrams modeling to multi-attribute utility theory and analytic hierarchy process are covered.",
