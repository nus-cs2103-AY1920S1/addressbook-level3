    "description": "This module aims to introduce students to the rich intellectual heritage that has led to the development of Southeast Asian Studies as a distinct field of scholarly inquiry. We shall explore the critical debates, seminal texts and theoretical currents within the field in determining how different scholars have engaged with and conceptualized the region. We shall also consider the epistemological challenges of carrying out research in the region, and how Southeast Asians themselves have contributed new voices towards the evolution of the field.",
