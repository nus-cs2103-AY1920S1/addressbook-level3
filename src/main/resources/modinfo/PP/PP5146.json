    "description": "Today, a number of local governments and communities are expected to play vital roles in improving people\u2019s lives. This module introduces normative theories and timely real-world cases pertinent to decentralization and local governance. These are discussed in relation to topics of government efficiency, equity, corruption, conflict management, democratization, and sector-specific issues in education, health, and environmental and disaster management. Students will learn theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the topics and acquire analytical skills to address the challenges faced by localities and decentralizing states. The module is multidisciplinary, drawing on views from economics, public administration, and political science.",
