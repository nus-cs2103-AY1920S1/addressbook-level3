    "description": "This course explores the role of geometry in the emergence of perspective drawing during the Italian Renaissance. Through in-depth comparisons of seminal treatises such as Euclid\u2019s Elements and Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s On Painting, students will rediscover the crucial ideas that motivated the development of (non-Euclidean) projective geometry in seventeenth century Europe. No prior knowledge of geometry or familiarity with advanced mathematics is required.",
