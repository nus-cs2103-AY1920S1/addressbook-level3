== Introduction

TimeBook is a desktop application that is morphed from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3). TimeBook is a scheduler application that aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends. It also can find the common free time and venues among the user and his or her friends. TimeBook will have the following features:

.  A graphical user interface (GUI) but most of the interactions with the application would happen using command line interface (CLI).
.  Allows users to add the schedules of his or her friends and organise them into groups.
.  Deconflict different schedules of different people and different groups to find the common free time among them.
.  Integration with NUSmods API to allow users to enter their NUSmods timetable link to add it to their schedule.
.  Integration with Google Maps API to allow the application to evaluate the best venue for the group to meet up during the free time in their schedules.

TimeBook is for users who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their schedules*. More importantly, TimeBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TimeBook can get your schedule management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
