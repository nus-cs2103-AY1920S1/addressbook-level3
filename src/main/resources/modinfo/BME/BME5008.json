    "description": "This module deals with the responsibilities of senior executives for the effective management and utilization of human resources. The module will also deal with critical HR issues arising from new business challenges in the 21st century, such as anticipated demographic and value changes in the labour force, business diversification and globalization, organisational reorienting and restructuring and working relationships and corporate cultures in the process of transition. The central perspective is the cross-cultural management of people within Asian businesses. Topics include: the design and management of personnel systems; planning, employee development and retention, staff appraisal and the design of reward systems, employee relations and collective bargaining; the implications of an ageing population for human resources planning and management; comparative perspectives on HRM; and managing professional employees, whose competencies and specialised knowledge increasingly determine and sustain competitive advantage.",
