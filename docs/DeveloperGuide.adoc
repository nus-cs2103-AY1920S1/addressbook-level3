[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagramMams.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`MamsStorage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. Holds data of Students, Modules and Appeals.
* <<Design-Storage,*`CommandHistoryStorage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. Contains history of user inputs.


Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addmod s/1 m/1`.

.Component interactions for `addmod s/1 m/1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagramMams.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

//tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Overall Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassArchitectureDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`,
 `AppealListPanel` (from `Appeal` UI package), `ModuleListPanel` (from `Module` UI package) ,
 `StudentListPanel` (from `Student` UI package) etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

A closer look at each of the packages within the UI component is given in the next two class diagrams.

.A more detailed view of the classes within the `Appeal`, `Module`, and `Student` packages. Note that the abstract class `UiPart` is intentionally omitted for neatness of representation.
image::UiItemListClassDiagram.png[]

.A more detailed view of the classes within the `History` package. Note that the abstract class `UiPart` is intentionally omitted for neatness of representation.
image::UiHistoryWindowClassDiagram.png[]

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` (Appeals, Modules, Students) and `Logic` (Command History) data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

//end::ui[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component


[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

// tag::logic[]
.Structure of the Parser Component
image::ParserClassDiagram.png[width=650]
// end::logic[]

.Structure of the Command Component
image::CommandClassDiagram.png[]



*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MamsParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module to a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("undo")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `undo` Command
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/mams/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/mams/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Mams data in json format and read it back.
* can save the command history data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `mams.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::find[]
=== Find feature

The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand` class. The `FindCommand` stores a `List` of `Predicates`, which can be
`StudentContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, or `AppealContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Each `Predicate` stores a `List` of String of keywords.

.Predicate Class Diagram
image::PredicateClassDiagram.png[]

Below shows how the Find Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `find ...`.

Step 2. The `FindCommandParser` is called first to create relevant `Predicate` by checking the prefixes.

Step 3. A new `FindCommand` is created by passing in the `List` of `Predicates`.

Step 4. `FindCommand.execute()` is called. Each `Predicate` calls respective `Predicate.test()`. `Model#updateStudentList()`, `Model#updateModuleList()`, or `Module#updateAppealList()` is called accordingly.

Step 5. A `CommandResult` object is returned, which contains message about the number of items found in the target list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Find command works:

.Find Command Sequence Diagram - user input: "find m/cs1010"
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::find[]

//tag::clash1[]
=== Clash feature

The clash feature is facilitated by `ClashCommand` class, and two additional static classes:

* `ClashCommandParameters`: Stores the details of the parsed parameters that a `ClashCommand` will operate on.

.ClashCommandParameters Class Diagram
image::ClashCommandParametersClassDiagram.png[]
* `ClashCase`: Stores the details of the clash cases between two modules that a `ClashCommand` will operate on.

.ClashCase Class Diagram
image::ClashCaseClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Similar to how time slot is stored in `Module` class, the clashing slots in `ClashCase` are represented as Integers and
each integer value corresponds to a particular 1-hour time slot in a week.

// end::clash1[]

====
There are a few formats allowed for user inputs:

* `clash a/INDEX`: check timetable clash for a add/drop module appeal
* `clash m/INDEX m/INDEX` or `clash m/MODULE_CODE m/MODULE_CODE`: check timetable clash between two different modules
* `clash s/INDEX`: check timetable clash in a student's current timetable

====

// tag::clash2[]

Below shows how the Clash Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `clash ...` to check whether there is clash in the timetable.

Step 2. The `ClashCommandParser` is called to create a new `ClashCommandParameters` and set the relevant parameter values accordingly.

Step 3. A new `ClashCommand` is created by passing in the `ClashCommandParameters` object.

Step 4. `ClashCommand.execute()` is called. The types of checking will be determined by checking the presence of relevant parameters in `ClashCommandParameters`.

Step 5. Each `ClashCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which contains the message of the clash details if there are clashes and 'No clashes detected' if there is no clash.

The following activity diagram shows how the clash command works:

.Work Flow of Clash Command
image::ClashCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The `Student` who submits the appeal is stored as String of Matric ID and `Module` to add/drop is stored as String of module code in an `Appeal` object.
Hence, `Student` who submits the appeal is retrieved from `model.getFullStudentList()` by matching Matric ID,
and `Module` to add/drop is retrieved from `model.getFullModuleList()` by matching module codes.

===== Design Consideration 1: How to deal with different user input formats for different types of checking

* **Current choice:** Only 1 `ClashCommand` class. Every `ClashCommand` object keeps a `ClashCommandParameters` object which stores the parameters passed in.
The value of parameters are set when parsing user inputs using a few setter methods.
The cases of checking are determined in `ClashCommand.execute()` by checking the presence of each parameter.
** Pros:
*** Avoid having too many unnecessary constructors (or passing of null-values) caused by the optional nature of the parameters passed to ClashCommand.
*** If more user input formats are allowed in the future to improve user experience (not restricted to index and module codes),
we can simply add more setter and getter methods in `ClashCommandParameters` accordingly.
** Cons:
*** More defensive programming is needed to ensure that no parameters of different types of checking are present at the same time.
* **Alternative considered:** Create three different sub-classes (i.e. `ClashAppealCommand`, `ClashModuleCommand`, and `ClashStudentCommand`) which extend from an abstract `ClashCommand` class.
`ClashCommandParser` deals with differentiating cases for checking (by looking at prefixes) and creates `ClashCommand` object accordingly.
** Pros:
*** Each `ClashCommand` has knowledge about what type of checking is evoked. Less checking is required in `ClashCommand.execute()`.
** Cons:
*** Each sub-class will have different attributes. Tedious modification will be needed if we allow more user input formats in the future to improve user experience.

===== Design Consideration 2: How to show details of the clashing time slots

* **Current choice:** Use a static class `ClashCase` to store each clash case.
** Pros:
*** No need to hardcode the string representation of clash details since all information needed is stored in the `ClashCase` and we can simply call `toString()`.
Even if the way of representation is to be changed in the future, we only need to modify `toString()` (and add attributes in `ClashCase` if needed).
** Cons:
*** Additional objects created for each clash detected between two modules. More memory space used.
* **Alternative considered:** Every `ClashCommand` object keeps a list of to store time slot index and use them to create a temporary `Module` object.
** Pros:
*** Can reuse `getTimeSlotToString()` to obtain the string representation. (The current choice also keeps this part)
** Cons:
*** Need to hardcode information like module codes of the two modules having clashes since the list only stores the clashing slots.
*** Tedious modification needed if the way of response changes in the future. For example, instead of showing the clash details in the message bar,
we decide to a pop-up window to show more detailed information or include graphic representation.
// end::clash2[]

//tag::addremovemod[]
=== Add and remove module feature
==== Implementation
The addmod/removemod mechanism is facilitated by an abstract `ModCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class.
There are the two sub-classes which extends `ModCommand` used to handle adding module or removing module function.

The two sub-classes are:

* `AddModCommand` -- Add a module to a student (Registers the student for a particular module)
* `RemoveModCommand` -- Removes a module from a student (Drops a module from the student's workload)

.Structure of ModCommand
image::ModCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each addmod or removemod command has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. These commands
retrieve information of all students and modules from model to get the relevant student and module.
It then creates a copy of the relevant items and replaces the original ones in the global list of students and modules.

Below shows how the AddModCommand mechanism behaves at each step when adding a module to a student.

[NOTE]
RemoveMod command is functionally the opposite of AddMod command, but requires less checks to be done before successful
execution. For this developer guide, only AddMod commands sequence will be elaborated.

Step 1. The user inputs `addmod s/A0180000 m/CS1010` to add module CS1010 to student A0180000.

Step 2. The `ApproveCommandParser` will be called to parse the AddModCommand.

* When parsing the input, the `s/` prefix will be detected and `AddModCommandParser` will parse for a
student identifier. `m/` prefix will also be detected and parsed for a module identifier.

Step 3. `AddModCommand` object will be created.

Step 4. `AddModCommand.execute()` is called.

The following activity diagram shows how `AddModCommand.execute()` works

.AddModCommand Activity Diagram
image::AddModCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

`ApproveCommand.execute()`

* Step 1. Checks for the validity of student and module identifiers. If index is given as the identifier, the following
list(s) is used: `model.getFilteredModuleList` and `model.getFilteredStudentList`. If Matric Id is given for student identifier
or Module code is given for module identifier, it will get the following list(s) instead:
`model.getFullModuleList` and `model.getFullStudentList`
* Step 2. Checks the following conditions that should prevent module from being added to student:
** Check if the student already has the module (Is currently registered for module already)
** Check if the student has completed the module before
** Check if the module current intake has already reached quota limit, and is unable to accept any more students
** Check if the student workload limit will not be exceeded if the module is added to the student
** Check if the module being added will clash with any existing modules the student is currently taking.
* Step 3. Creates a new student object and module object with the added module.
* Step 4. Creates a `CommandResult` object which calls `Model` to replace the old objects
with the newly created objects. The success message of addmod request will be returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how ApproveCommand works:

.AddModCommand Sequence Diagram
image::AddModSequenceDiagram.png[]
[NOTE]
An exception is thrown when any of the checks fail. The break interaction operator is placed at the bottom
of all the checks in order to reduce vision clutter.
[NOTE]
To reduce vision clutter, only two of the six checks are shown.
//end::addremovemod[]

//tag::resolve[]
=== Resolve feature
==== Implementation

The resolve feature is facilitated by an abstract `ResolveCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class and
2 sub-classes which extends `ResolveCommand` for different types of appeal resolution.

The 2 type of appeal resolution are:

* `Approve` -- approves an appeal.
* `Reject` -- rejects an appeal.

Each appeal resolution type has an individual and mass resolution command which extends its base type

The 2 types of resolution commands for `Approve` are

* `ApproveCommand` -- approves an individual appeal by index shown in the in-app UI
* `MassApprove` -- approves multiple appeals by the ID of appeals

Similarly the types of resolution commands for `Reject` are

* `RejectCommand` -- rejects an individual appeal by index shown in the in-app UI
* `MassReject` -- rejects multiple appeals by the ID of appeals

.Structure of ResolveCommand
image::ResolveCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each appeal resolution command has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. Resolve commands retrieve information of all students and modules from model to get the relevant student and module.
It then creates a copy of the relevant items and replaces the original ones in the global list of students and modules

Below shows how the ResolveCommand mechanism behaves at each step when resolving a single appeal.

[NOTE]
Reject commands behaves the same way as approve commands, except it will not make any changes to any students or module. For this developer guide, only approve commands sequence will be elaborated

Step 1. The user inputs `approve a/2 r/Student meets requirements` to approve an appeal of index specified.  In this example the appeal index is 2.

Step 2. The `ApproveCommandParser` will be called to parse the individual approve command .

* When parsing the input, the `a/` prefix will be detected and `ApproveCommandParser` will parse a single index and the remark after the optional field `r/`.

Step 3. `ApproveCommand` object will be created.

Step 4. `ApproveCommand.execute()` is called.

`ApproveCommand.execute()`

* Step 1. It will check the type of appeal of the appeal index specified by the user, it will check through `model.getFilteredAppealList()` and get the index of the appeal that matches that of the given one.
* Step 2. Checks whether the appeal has already been resolved with `Appeal.isResolved()`
* Step 3. If is not yet resolved, nature of appeal will be retrieved with `Appeal.getAppealType()`.  There are 3 types of appeal cases - add module, drop module and increase workload
** Add module
***  Check if relevant module and student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check for clashes between module requested and the modules the student is current taking (refer to 3.1 for implementation for `ClashCommand`)
***  If no clashes are detected add student to module class list and module to the student's list of modules
** Drop module
***  Check if relevant module and student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check if student is taking the module
***  Removes specified module from student and student from module
** Increase workload
***  Increases the specified student's workload to the one specified in the appeal

The following activity diagram shows how `ApproveCommand.execute()` works

.ApproveCommand Activity Diagram
image::ApproveCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The student current modules are stored as String of module code to reduce coupling. Hence, modules taken by the student are retrieved from `model.getFilteredModuleList()` by matching module codes.


[NOTE]
The `Student` who submits the appeal and requested `Module` are stored as String of Matric ID and module code respectively in an `Appeal` object to reduce coupling.
Hence, `Student` who submits the appeal is retrieved from `model.getFullStudentList()` by matching Matric ID,
and `Module` requested is retrieved from `model.getFullModuleList()` by matching module codes.


Step 5.  Upon approval of an appeal, `ApproveCommand` will return a `CommandResult` object which contains the message of the action performed.  Each appeal type will give a different feedback message.

 * Add module will inform user if approval is not allowed due to clashes in time table, else it will feedback the specified module has been added to the student by their IDs

 * Drop module will inform user if approval is not allowed due to the student not having the module to be dropped in the first place, else if will feedback the specified module was removed from the student by their IDs

 * Increase workload will inform user of the increase inthe student's Modular Credits limit

The following sequence diagram shows how ApproveCommand works:

.ResolveCommand Sequence Diagram
image::ResolveSequenceDiagram.png[]


Below shows how the ResolveCommand mechanism behaves at each step when resolving multiple appeals.

Step 1. The user inputs `approve mass/C000000 C000001 C000010` to approve all the appeals specifed.

Step 2. The `ApproveCommandParser` will be called to parse the mass approve command.

* When parsing the input, the `mass/` prefix will be detected and `ApproveCommandParser` will parse all the appeal IDs specifed.  Valid and invalid IDs will be separated into 2 lists.

Step 3. `MassApprove` object will be created with both the lists of valid and invalid IDs.

Step 4. `MassApprove.execute()` is called.

`MassApprove.execute()`

[NOTE]
Mass resolve commands `execute()` methods works the same as individual Resolve commands except it will loop through the list of valid Appeal IDs to resolve each one.
Successful resolution of each appeal in the valid appeal list will add the ID to successful list.
Similarly, appeal IDs from valid Appeal IDs that were not approved/rejected will be added to the unsuccessful list.
Also, because Mass resolve commands operates on appeal IDs, `model.getFullAppealList()` will be used instead of `model.getFilteredAppealList()`.


* Step 1. It will check the type of appeal of the appeal index specified by the user, it will check through `model.getFullAppealList()` and get the index of the appeal that matches that of the given one.
* Step 2. Checks weather the appeal has already been resolved with `Appeal.isResolved()`
* Step 3. If is not yet resolved, nature of appeal will be retrieved with `Appeal.getAppealType()`.  There are 3 types of appeal cases - add module, drop module and increase workload
** Add module
***  Check if relevant module and the student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check for clashes between module requested and the modules the student is current taking (refer to 3.1 for implementation for `ClashCommand`)
***  If no clashes are detected add the student to module class list and module to the student's list of modules
** Drop module
***  Check if relevant module and student exists by getting `model.getFullModuleList()` and `model.getFullStudentList()`
***  Check if student is taking the module
***  Removes specified module from student and student from module
** Increase workload
***  Increases the specified student's workload to the one specified in the appeal

The following activity diagram shows how `MassApprove.execute()` works

.MassApprove Activity Diagram
image::MassApproveActivityDiagram.png[]

Step 5.  After resolving all the appeal IDs in the valid Appeal list, `MassApprove` will return a `CommandResult` object which contains the feedback message.  Feedback message will show a list of successfully approved appeal IDs,
a list of unresolved modules which include the list of invalid appeal IDs entered by user and appeal IDs
and a list of appeal IDs with time table clash detected.

.MassResolve Sequence Diagram
image::MassResolveSequenceDiagram.png[]

Design Consideration: How to handle different user input formats for individual and mass appeal resolution

* Current choice: Resolving individual appeals, `ApproveCommand` and `RejectCommand` takes in a single index relative to the displayed list of appeals while resolving multiple appeals, `MassApprove` and `MassReject` takes in IDs of exisiting appeals.

** Pros:
*** User can easily resolve a single appeal since needs to enter the index of the appeal of choice shown in the appeal list.
*** When resolving in bulk, typing the full appeal IDs will allow user to be certain that the appeal that is about to be resolved is indeed the correct one.
** Cons:
*** Users have to type the full appeal IDs of appeals when resolving in bulk.
*** Users cannot resolve multiple appeals by index as the displayed appeal list is may be changing constantly with the filter commands entered by user.  As a result, user will be more prone to resolving a wrong appeal due to carelessness when using index.

* Alternative consideration: Allow user to resolve individual and multiple appeals by both index and appeal ID.

** Pros:
*** User has options to perform appeal resolution.
*** Easier to resolve multiple appeals in bulk, as it is quicker to type the index instead of the full ID
** Cons:
*** Harder to implement.  `ApproveCommandParser` and `RejectCommandParser` will need to parse different type of parameters.
*** Some index and parameters from  the input might refer to the same appeal if the user makes a mistake.  As such, feedback provided by MAMS will not be useful, as user might have used index to mass resolve rather than appeal ID.
*** User could resolve the wrong appeals since user does not need to cross check with the appeal ID of the appeals-of-interest.

Design Consideration: How individual resolve and mass resolve extends from parent `ResolveCommand`

* Current implementation: Each resolve option `Approve` and `Reject` extends from `ResolveCommand`

** Pros:
*** Easier to implement.  Resolve option specified by user will be easily parsed.
** Cons:
*** More parameters required from user to specify whether to resolve single or multiple appeals.


* Alternative consideration: Having individual resolve commands and mass resolve commands extend from parent class `ResolveCommand` instead of `Approve` and `Reject`.  Refer to diagram below for better understanding.

image::ResolveAltClassDiagram.png[]

** Pros:
*** User can specify whether to resolve single or multiple appeals with fewer keywords.
** Cons:
*** Harder to implement as the mass resolve command Parser will have to parse the inputs for different resolve types.
*** User prone to input mistakes while performing mass resolve.

//end::resolve[]

// tag::history[]
=== Command History
The command history feature encapsulates a few related functions, mainly:

* The ability to cycle through previous inputs in the `CommandBox` using the kbd:[&uarr;]
and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys.
* A command to open a new window displaying the command history
- Optional parameters can be specified to hide command output and show only successful commands.
* Persistent storage of command history - the history is serialized to JSON file format
and is loaded upon the next startup

==== Cycling Through Previous Inputs
The core of the cycle-command-history feature is implemented through three different classes:
 `CommandHistory`, `ListPointer`, and `InputOutput` (with an internal `TimeStamp` object). In addition, the `CommandBox` from AB3 was modified
to accommodate the changes.

* `InputOutput`: Class representing a single command history entry. Comprises of an `input` and `output` String,
a `TimeStamp` object, and a flag indicating whether execution was successful.
* `TimeStamp`: Class representing a time-stamp. Internally, it functions as a higher-level wrapper around `java.util.Date`.
* `CommandHistory`: A wrapper around a list of `InputOutput` objects along with specific methods, representing
the command history of the command entered thus far.
* `ListPointer`: An iterable pointer to a `List` of objects. This is used by the `CommandBox` to cycle through
past commands.
- This differs from `java.util.Iterator` in the sense that `ListPointer#next()` always advances the pointer first then returns the
next element in the `List`, while `java.util.Iterator#next()` does the opposite: it returns
the current value, then advances the pointer.
- `ListPointer` was implemented using Java generics
to serve as a common utility class in `mams.common.util`, but is used primarily for
iterating a `List` of `InputOutput` objects for the command history feature.
* `CommandBox`: The command box in MAMs was modified to respond to the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;]
`KeyEvent`, auto-filling the text field with the previous commands when iterating through the command history.

Below is a class diagram depicting the relationship between the involved classes for cycling
through previous inputs in the command box.


.Class Diagram depicting classes involved in cycling through the command history.
image::CycleCommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

`CommandHistory` provides an unmodifiable view into the command history using an `ObservableList`
passed to `CommandBox` upon initialization. `CommandBox` uses this list to reinitialize and
update `ListPointer` after every command execution. Upon initialization, `ListPointer` keeps
an internal copy of the InputOutput list. Finally, `CommandBox` responds to user key-presses and
retrieves the previous commands by using `ListPointer` to iterate
through its internal defensive list.

Below is a simple sequence diagram depicting this function. Note that some methods/pathways are not
depicted for brevity.


.Sequence Diagram depicting a possible execution path for cycling through history entries.
image::CycleCommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

The diagram above first shows how `CommandBox` re-initializes and updates `ListPointer` after
a command has been entered. Thereafter (in the period between command inputs),
`KeyEvent` events are handled by `handleKeyPress`,
which replaces the text in its text field accordingly.

*Design Considerations*

Aspect: How `ListPointer` (iterator used by `CommandBox`) is updated

* Current Implementation: Stores a defensive copy of the command history in `ListPointer`.
The `ListPointer` is re-initialized after every command
execution in MAMS (when new entries are added to the command history).

** Pros:
*** `ListPointer` only has a direct dependence on the passed `CommandHistory` list during initialization.
If the reference to that list is invalidated for any reason while
the user is iterating through the list, `ListPointer` will be unaffected since it stores a defensive copy.

** Cons:
*** It may be more computationally heavy to re-initialize `ListPointer` with a new defensive copy after every
command execution, especially if the command history has many entries from long-term usage of the application.

* Alternative Implementation: Do not store a defensive copy. After every re-initialization, `ListPointer`
will instead store the direct reference to the command history list.

** Pros:
*** `ListPointer` re-initialization will most likely process in O(1) constant time (only needs to copy reference),
which might be computationally more efficient than the current implementation.

** Cons:
*** If the reference to the list is invalidated for any reason (eg. new feature by future developers) in between command executions, `ListPointer`
might run into an unrecoverable error (eg. `NullPointerException`) while user is cycling and iterating through command history.

==== Displaying History Window: `HistoryCommand`

The `HistoryCommand` feature allows users to display a separate window showing the
MAMS input/output history upon command.

The core of the `HistoryCommand` feature is facilitated by a few different classes:

* `HistoryCommand`: A sub-type of the abstract `Command` class. Represents a user command to trigger the display
of the history window.
* `HistoryCommandParser`: A class to parse user input in the context of a `HistoryCommand`,
returning a `HistoryCommand`.
* `HistoryWindow`: A UI class representing the controller for the history window. Displays information
about the command history to the user
* `CommandHistory`: see previous section.
* `FilterOnlyCommandHistory`: An interface that inherits from `ReadOnlyCommandHistory`. Exposes methods to
read and filter the internal list in `CommandHistory`, while restricting modification access.

In addition to the above, a GUI for the history window was also written and implemented using JavaFX and styled with CSS.
Refer to an earlier section of this guide for a class diagram of the classes used to implement the history GUI window: <<Design-Ui>>

The following activity sequence diagram provides a high-level view
of how the command is executed, along with the behaviour of the history window:

.HistoryCommand Activity Diagram
image::HistoryCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

One specific execution example of the show-history feature with
more specific implementation details is as follows:

. User enters `history -o -s` into command box. The `-o` option indicates user intention to hide all command output
display in the history window, and the `-s` option indicates user intention to show only successful commands.
. A `HistoryCommand` object is created after parsing, with `hideOutput` set to true, and HistoryDisplaySettings set to
`SHOW_ONLY_SUCCESSFUL`.
. `HistoryCommand` object is executed on `Model` (unused) and `FilterOnlyCommandHistory`. The `FilterOnlyCommandHistory` taken in as a parameter is updated
with a predicate to filter successful commands.
 - NOTE: Since the history window uses an observer pattern to update the history window (keeps reference to `ObservableList`),
the history window is updated at this step.
. A `CommandResult` object is returned
with `showHistory` and `hideOutput` flags set to true.
. `Logic` updates `CommandHistory` with this command, as with any other command.
 - NOTE: Again, the observer pattern used by the history window prompts a GUI update at this step.
. The `CommandResult` object is passed to the calling GUI element (`MainWindow`), which is then used to set
the flags in `HistoryWindow` controller accordingly.
. `HistoryWindow` hides all command outputs in the history window.
. MAMS displays the history window.

This specific execution case is shown in the following sequence diagram. Note that some
methods are omitted for brevity.

NOTE: The lifeline for `HistoryCommandParser` and `HistoryCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

*Design Consideration*

Aspect: Method for displaying command history

* Current Implementation: Deploy a dedicated pop-up window for displaying command history. This window will retrieve the
`CommandHistory` list directly to update itself.

** Pros:
*** All display decisions (eg. formatting of the history text, navigability of the list) can be encapsulated
within the UI component - specifically, within `HistoryWindow` and its related classes.
*** Display can be optimized solely for displaying the command history, without the need to check for compatibility with
other commands/features that may be using the same UI element to display.
*** Since command history can be extremely verbose, having a separate pop-up window will ensure that the user is have enough
space to view it properly.
*** The history window can be kept open while running other commands to provide informative real-time feedback on commands
that were performed.

** Cons:
*** Requires a whole new GUI window (and its elements) to be created and debugged for any display issues, which can be a
tedious process.

* Alternative Implementation: Format the entire history to text within the execution of `HistoryCommand` and pass it back to the GUI
as a normal command feedback, to be displayed in the `ResultDisplay` box of the GUI.

** Pros:
*** Requires very minimal change to the AB3 GUI, since the GUI elements for `ResultDisplay` already exists
to display normal command feedback.
*** The history window GUI elements would no longer be required, eliminating the need to create, style, debug, and
format an entirely new GUI window.

** Cons:
*** Text display filtering and formatting is now handled directly by the `HistoryCommand` class, which severely limits
the ability of the GUI to customize the display (eg. colour code input and output differently)
*** As a corollary to the above point, the `HistoryCommand` class is now
in charge of one aspect of the display formatting, which is not a good separation of responsibilities
between the `Logic` and `Ui` components of MAMS.
*** The `ResultDisplay` on the main window of the GUI application is only optimized to display command feedback
of short length (up to 3 or 4 lines on most monitors). It is hence not suitable for displaying
output from the `HistoryCommand`, which can become extremely verbose especially if the application has
been used extensively.
*** If the command output in the history is to be displayed, special care must be taken not to recursively include
the outputs of previous `history` commands in later `history` commands. (This is not an issue in the current implementation,
which separates history command feedback from the history display through the means of a separate UI). A contrived example
is shown below:

 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
 >> history
 input: list -a
 output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
 input: history
 output: input: list -a
         output: listed all appeals
         input: history
         output: input: list -a
                 output: listed all appeals

**** Each subsequent call to `history` command unnecessarily includes outputs of previous `history` commands
**** Special conditional logic is hence required to exclude or handle `history` command output from the command history,
which can obfuscate the code for command history and cause it
to be less understandable to future developers if not implemented or documented properly.
*** Whenever history is to be viewed, the `history` command has to be performed again.


Aspect: Implementation to allow existing `Command` sub-type classes like `HistoryCommand` to access and manipulate
command history (eg. read past commands, perform filtering)

* Current Implementation: To allow `HistoryCommand` to access the command history, change the
method signature in `Command#execute(Model model)`
to accept another `FilterOnlyCommandHistory` object (to access `CommandHistory` through an API that only
allows filtering and reading, not modification). The history window GUI elements will then use
the observer pattern to update itself based on changes in the `FilteredCommandHistory`. A flag is also
raised in the returned `CommandResult` object to indicate to the GUI that the history window is to be opened.

** Pros:
*** The history window will update itself automatically (regardless of whether it is showing)
after every change to `CommandHistory`, without the need to explicitly pass a list object to
the GUI controller (except during initialization) after every execution.
*** Future commands will also have access to a version of `CommandHistory` that allows reading and filtering,
which can be useful for commands that
require knowledge of past commands eg. an undo command that can be specified to act only on certain commands.
*** Using such an interface to access `CommandHistory` also prevents future commands by other developers
from unwittingly modifying the `CommandHistory`, which should only be performed by `LogicManager` after
command executions. This is to maintain a true record of the executed commands.

** Cons:
*** Requires a change to the method signature of every existing command, which may cause unexpected
regression problems if refactoring is not performed appropriately.
*** Most commands may not need access to `CommandHistory`, so the extra parameter may be redundant in most
calls of `#execute()`.

* Alternative Implementation 1: Change the method signature of `Command#execute(Model model)`
to directly take in a reference to the `CommandHistory` object in `Logic`. GUI will still update via the
observer pattern as per the current implementation, and display command history in a separate window.

** Pros:
*** Same as the current implementation above, except for the last point.

** Cons:
*** Also requires a change to the method signature of every existing command, which can cause unexpected
regression problems if refactoring is not performed appropriately.
*** Future commands by other developers now have direct access to the `CommandHistory` object in `Logic`,
and may cause unintentional modification to `CommandHistory` object during exeuction of command.

* Alternative Implementation 2: Instead of changing the `#execute()` signature of the `Command` abstract class,
only use the flag in the returned `CommandResult` object to indicate to the GUI that the history window is to be displayed.
This is similar to how the `HelpCommand` and `ExitCommand` is implemented in AB3.

** Pros:
*** Simple to implement, and requires very minimal changes to the existing code architecture (Only `CommandResults` and GUI
needs to be changed/extended).

** Cons:
*** Although it still provides the same default display as the current implementation, the displayed command history
can no longer be preferentially filtered based on the parameters passed in to the `history` command. This may
limit the utility of the `history` command (even in future development), as the user now has to scroll
through the entire history instead of filtering it based on certain criteria (which can even be expanded on in the future).
**** One way of circumventing this is by
passing more boolean flags (or parameters) to `CommandResult` for the `HistoryWindow` to process, but this would
cause the `CommandResult` class to store too many attributes specific to just the `HistoryCommand`, which would not be
a particularly good design since all `Command` objects have a dependency on the `CommandResult` class.

=== Sync Command History to disk

The command history in MAMS is persistent across sessions -
history data is automatically saved to disk as a `.json` file whenever
`CommandHistory` is updated with new command information.
Upon startup, MAMS will load the history data from the same file.
This is useful for resuming work from a previous session,
or for supervisory figures within NUS to keep a permanent
log of all data changes that the appeal administrator makes.

This sub-feature of command history is facilitated by the following main classes/interfaces:

* `JsonCommandHistoryStorage`: A class that manages the reading and writing of `CommandHistory` to disk
* `JsonSerializableCommandHistory`: A class representing a `CommandHistory` object that is Jackson-compatible (able to be used for
serializing to-and-from JSON format), with methods for converting it back to the native `CommandHistory` object used in MAMS.
* `JsonAdaptedInputOutput`: A class representing an `InputOutput` object that is Jackson-compatible,
and contains methods for freely converting itself back to the native `InputOutput` object used in MAMS.
* `CommandHistoryStorage`: API that the main `StorageManager` class uses to manipulate JSON serializing of `CommandHistory`.

Below is a class diagram depicting the relationship between the involved classes in JSON serializing of `CommandHistory`

.Class diagram of the classes involved in saving and loading of `CommandHistory` from disk.
image::CommandHistoryStorageClassDiagram.png[]

**Design Considerations:**

Aspect: Integrating storage mechanism for command history component with current MAMS architecture

* Current Implementation: Introduce architecture for saving `CommandHistory` to a separate JSON file.

** Pros:
*** Command history saving is now separate from saving of `Model` data. If deserialization of `CommandHistory` fails,
it should not affect the loading of `Model` data, and vice versa. This is especially important as command history is
a non-critical portion of MAMS, whereas `Model` data is critical to operation of MAMS.
*** If `Model` JSON data is corrupted, `CommandHistory` JSON data might not be since it is in a separate file,
with its own pipeline for loading and saving within the `Storage` class. Moreover, the `CommandHistory` can be used
to restore the `Model` data by repeating the same sequence of commands on the original data source for that semester, or from a
backup copy of MAMS.
*** Command history data file can be imported and archived separately (eg. for viewing on 3rd-party applications,
for maintaining an archived log of administrator actions). This can improve future extensibility and potential areas of development
for this feature, to fulfil its goal of maintaining a permanent record of administrator actions for accountability and logging purposes
(possibly conducted by a third-party other than the administrator).

** Cons:
*** Harder to implement, with more more code to be written and bug-proofed.

* Alternative Implementation: Serialize `CommandHistory` to the same file used by MAMS for its `Model` data.

** Pros:
*** Easier to implement and integrate into existing MAMS architecture.

** Cons:
*** Corruption of the non-critical `CommandHistory` data can cause `Model` data loading to fail, even if nothing is
wrong with the serialized `Model` data.
*** In the grand scheme of things, it may not be particularly useful to couple `Model` data to `CommandHistory` data.
MAMS is designed as an intermediate application that takes in Appeal, Module, and Student information from a data source
(eg. EduRec), allows administrators to resolve the appeal, then passes back the resolved appeal, module, and student data.
Applications receiving the resolved data file in the form of the serialized data may not have any use for the command history.
Of course, there can be alternative design solutions to this as well.

//tag::undo[]
=== Backup and undo actions feature
==== Implementation

The backup feature is facilitated by an abstract `StoreCommand` class which extends abstract `Command` class and
three sub-classes which extends `StoreCommand` to handle different types of saving and restoring actions.

The three sub-classes are:

* `SaveCommand` -- Creates a snapshot of MAMS as a backup and stores it as a json file in data.
* `UndoCommand` -- Undo last action.
* `RedoCommand` -- Redo last undo.
* `RestoreCommand` -- Restores a previous snapshot created by the SaveCommand.

.Structure of StoreCommand
image::StoreCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Each sub-class has a `execute()` method that takes in a `Model` object. Store commands only retrieve information from /data file and replaces the current state with the targeted state.

Below shows how the Store Command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `undo/redo/backup/restore ...`.

Step 2. The relevant parser class is called.

Step 3. Relevant StoreCommand object will be created accordingly depending on steps required to store or restore states.

Step 4. `StoreCommand.execute()` is called.

* If the command is a `UndoCommand`, it will store a snapshot in the data file under its corresponding tag.
* If the command is a `RedoCommand`, it will check if a redo action is availiable, restores the state and update the saved states as required.
* If the command is a `SaveCommand`, it will store a snapshot in the data file under its given tag or a tagged with a timestamp to avoid overwriting previous data if tag is not given.
* If the command is a `RestoreCommand`, it will restore a previous snapshot in the data folder with its given tag.

[NOTE]
The save states are stored in the same format as the mams.json data file to reduce coupling of the saving mechanism and the save commands.

Step 5. Each `StoreCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which contains the success or failure of the action and the filename the backup is saved under if applicable.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.UndoCommand Sequence Diagram
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Aspect: Dealing with storage of states

* **Current Choice:** Saves state to data folder in the same file format as the main data.
** Pros: Persistence of previous actions independent of running state of the program, allows for crash recovery in the event the program is exited incorrectly.
** Cons: Opens the program up to attacks that target the data folder, as the states are now accessable outside of the program instead of protected by a layer of abstraction.
* **Alternative :** Saves states as internal list of states
** Pros: States are only accessable using the application, protecting it from unwanted modifications.
** Cons: States are limited to current instance of the application, and history cannot be transfered between sessions

===== Aspect: Replacing the current state with targeted undo/redo states

* **Current choice:** Reads lists stored in targeted data file and replaces current data with targeted data
** Pros: Does not require knowledge of implementation of running state, thus reducing coupling of StoreCommand and program state.
** Cons: Requires StoreCommand to be modified each time a new type of list is implemented.
* **Alternative :** Replace the whole model with a new instance of target model
** Pros: Decreases coupling between internal implementation of any lists and StoreCommand
** Cons: Increases coupling between the Logic class and Command subclasses
// end::undo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

than 5 minutes to navigate (excluding the time needed for user
consideration and decision)
.  Should be convenient for users to view details of different objects
at the same time.
.  Should only load data from current semesters by default.
.  Should have a dark theme/comfortable visual interface as the user
might spend long hours on MAMS.
.  (Coming in 2.0) Should be able to differentiate between
student/appeal/module data from different semesters.
