== Introduction

Budget Buddy is for computing students who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their expenses.
More importantly, Budget Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Budget Buddy can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Furthermore, Budget Buddy allows computing students to add their own functions through customized JavaScript files,
as well as a set of rules to simplify expense tracking.
