    "description": "Global corporations now shape public life in countries across the world. Besides influencing governments and international organizations, they also directly operate services which were once the domain of government. This module investigates corporations as actors involved, often informally, in emerging configurations of power. Topics to be addressed include the roles of corporations in international financial institutions, in advising governments, in delivering overseas assistance, in writing treaties, and in otherwise participating in public life.",
