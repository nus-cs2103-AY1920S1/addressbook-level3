This course will cover major extensions to the standard OLS regression model and provide students with an introduction to the \u2018cutting edge\u2019 techniques used today to evaluate microeconomic theories and policies, including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, matching estimators, regression discontinuity and quantile regressions.
