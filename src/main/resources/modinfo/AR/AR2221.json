Unit I explores the pre-modern, pre-colonial, and colonial architectural legacies of Southeast Asia and introduces the terms and categories that are used to discuss them. Unit II looks at the theories, debates, and arguments on contextual response in modern and contemporary architecture in Southeast Asia since the early 20th century (coinciding with late colonial rule) through the post-independence period to contemporary times.",
