== Overview

Flashmind is a CLI-based flashcard app designed to help students memorise and revise important content.
It is used mainly for questions that can be answered with a short answer or several MCQ choices.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to start a quiz on a series of flashcards*
** What it does: Allows the user to start a timed quiz on a series of flashcards based on their tags. Users are able to choose one or multiple tags to quiz themselves on.
** Justification: This feature is a great enhancement for users who are looking to memorise content. Instead of just looking at the flashcard, users are able to test themselves in a timed condition and receive feedback from the system on whether their answer is correct.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a holistic understanding of how commands are received. The quiz function required an implementation of quiz mode, which locks certains command and allows a new set of commands to be executed.
** Credits: My teammate, Zhi Wei, helped to implement the timer in the quiz mode.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add two different types of flashcard: MCQ and ShortAnswer*
** What it does: Allows the user to choose whether they want their flashcard to have MCQ options or simply be a short answer flashcard.
** Justification: This feature enhances the user's learning experiences as flashcards are now more versatile, allowing users to have MCQ options for questions that are harder to remember.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a modification of storage, as well as a refactoring of the code to distinguish between MCQ and Short Answer flashcards.


* *Minor enhancement*:
** Split up the UI to return consecutive flashcards and the result to different displays.
