== Introduction

*Horo* is a command-line interface scheduling application.
It helps the user maintain a to-do list and a calendar, and posts timely reminders on their desktop.
This User Guide provides documentation of *Horo*'s functionalities.
Users may refer to this guide as a reference for what the application can do, as well as the commands that Horo will accept.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `horo.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Horo.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
* It is prefable to change your `horo.jar` location to an empty folder.
.  If double-clicking fails to start the app then do the following steps:
*  Open up Command Prompt
*  Change directory to your `horo.jar` location saved location.
*  Type `java -jar horo.jar` and GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `*add_task* "Buy Groceries"`: adds a task to Horo.
* `*delete_task* 0` : deletes the first task in Horo.
* `*exit*` : exits Horo.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

//tag::commandFormat[]
====
*Command Format for Horo*

* You can enter a command by typing the command name first followed by arguments of the command.
- E.g. `*command_name* <argument1> <argument2>...`

* If you want to type an argument containing blank spaces, surround your sentence within quotation marks.
- E.g. `"Buy Groceries"`
- E.g. `*add_task* "Buy Groceries"`

* Command parameters are prefixed by `--`, and they are optional.
- E.g. `*--date* 09/2019`
- E.g. `*calendar* *--date* 09/2019`

* Please take note that commands with extra arguments given are truncated.
- E.g. The `*calendar*` command does not accept any arguments, therefore if you enter `*calendar* 09/2019`, `09/2019` will be silently discarded.
====

====
*Command Format for this User Guide*

* Arguments are fully capitalized which are to be supplied by you.
- E.g. `*add_task* TASK`

* Arguments suffixed with ellipsis (`...`) indicate that the argument can be entered zero or more times.
- E.g. `*delete_task* INDEX...`

* Parameters separated by a vertical bar `|` can be used interchangeably.
- e.g. given the command format `-d|--description DESCRIPTION`, the following inputs accomplish the same thing:
- `*--description* "Buy Groceries"`
- `*-d* "Buy Groceries"`
====
//end::commandFormat[]

=== Asking for help : `help` **`[coming in v2.0]`**

Provides a guide if you ever need help with Horo's commands and command formats.

Command Format: +
`*help*`

=== Calendar, Events and Task

The following commands are related to Events and Tasks, which Horo recognises as different entities. Stated below are the differences between Events and Tasks:

* Event:
- Will show up on the Calendar.
- Cannot be marked as done. **`[coming in v2.0]`**
- Will be automatically removed from the Calendar past its due date, provided it is a non-recurring event.

* Task
- Will show up on the Calendar only if a due-date is specified. Otherwise it will be specified in the List.
- Can be marked as done. **`[coming in v2.0]`**
- If not accomplished by its due date, will be automatically archived into an undone list.

=== UI
The following commands are related to the changing the display of the UI.

Take note that UI-related commands are not affected by the `undo` and `redo` commands (For more information, see <<Undo-Redo>>).

==== Changing Screen View to Calendar View

.Calendar View Command for Calendar
image::Ui.png[]

The `calendar` command switches the display to the Calendar View, which displays a calendar of the specified month and year in addition to a timeline of the specified day, week or month.

The Calendar View will display the specified date. If no date is specified, the last specified date will be displayed. This defaults to the current date.

Upon the initial launch of the application, the timeline and calendar dates will be set to the system's current date.

Command Format: +
`*calendar*` +

Command Parameters: +
`*--date* MONTH_YEAR`

Argument Format: +
`MONTH_YEAR` : `MM/YYYY`

=== Notification System
Horo will post notifications to your system tray to remind you that an event is starting or that a task is due.

Take note that Horo can only post reminders as long as the application is open. To tell if Horo is running, check that the appropriate icon appears in the system tray

.Horo tray icon
image::HoroIconScreenShot.png[]

Also take note that notifications are switched on by default upon launch. This status is not carried over between sessions. If you would like to switch notifications off, you would have to do so whenever you start Horo up.

You can tell if notifications are switched on by mousing over the icon in the system tray.

.Mousing over the Horo tray icon
image::IconMouseOverScreenShot.png[]


==== Notification Popups
When Horo posts a notification, it should appear at the bottom-right side of the screen, where the system tray should be.

.A Popup Notification
image::PopUpScreenShot.png[]

Take note that that following commands are UI-related commands, and are thus unaffected by the `undo` and `redo` commands (For more information, see <<Undo-Redo>>).

==== Switch notifications on
The `notif_on` command switches notifications on. +

Command Format: +
`*notif_on*`

1. If you would like to switch notifications on, type the command *`notif_on`* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

.`notif_on` command in the Command Box
image::NotificationOnCommandBoxScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
2. An in-app popup should appear, displaying "Notifications switched on". The log view should also record this action. +

.Feedback for the `notif_on` command
image::NotificationOnFeedbackScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
// end:chenggengppp[]

Command Format: +
`*notif_off*`

1. If you would like to switch notifications off, type the command *`notif_off`* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

.`notif_off` command in the Command Box
image::NotificationOffCommandBoxScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
2. An in-app popup should appear, displaying "Notifications switched off". The log view should also record this action. +

.Feedback for the `notif_off` command
image::NotificationOffFeedbackScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
// end:notification[]

=== Undo-Redo
The following commands allow you to undo and redo previously input commands.

The below commands will only affect state-changing, and not UI-related commands. The commands that will be affected are as follows:

* *add_event*
* *delete_event*
* *edit_event*
* *add_task*
* *delete_task*
* *edit_task*
* *import*
* *export*


==== Undo

.Undo Command
image::UndoCommandScreenShot.png[]

The `undo` command undoes the previous command. +
Commands can be undone up to the program's launch.

Command Format: +
`*undo*`

Example:
Suppose that you have deleted the wrong task from Horo. Rather than having to type the `add_task` command
along with the description of the deleted task (to add back the wrongly deleted task), you can simply type in `undo`,
which will revert Horo to the state before the deletion of the wrong task was executed.

This means Horo is now restored to its desired state, as if you did not commit the deletion mistake at all!
You can now proceed to delete the right task.

Illustration:
Suppose that we wanted to delete task 2 in the list, but deleted task 3 instead.
(Horo also has a list view on top of the calendar view; I will illustrate the feature with with the list view)

To undo:

1. Type undo in the command box, and press the Enter key to execute it. +

.`undo` command in the Command Box
image::undoScenario1.png[]

{empty} +
2. The result box will display the message: "Previous command has been undone!" +

.Feedback for the `undo` command
image::undoScenario2.png[]

{empty} +
3. You can see that the wrongly deleted task (task 3) is visible in the list once again. +

.Result of the `undo` command
image::undoScenario3.png[]

[NOTE]
*The `undo` command undoes previous commands in reverse chronological order.* +
{empty} +
Suppose that you have executed the following commands in this order: +
{empty} +
1.	Adding a task +
2.	Editing a task +
{empty} +
Now, if you execute the `undo` command, you will first revert Horo to the state before a task was edited.
Then, if you execute `undo` again, you will revert Horo to the state before a task was added. +
{empty} +
*The `undo` command only works on state-changing commands.* +
{empty} +
State-changing commands are those that manipulate task and event data stored in Horo. Examples include `add_task`, `delete_task` and `edit_task`.
`Undo` commands only work on these types of commands because there is an actual change in the state of Horo that can be undone. +
{empty} +
On the other hand, non-state-changing commands include `find` and `help`. These commands are only concerned with producing
user output for the user in the GUI, but do not modify any of the data stored in Horo. As such, these types of commands
are ignored by the `undo` operation since there is nothing to `undo`. +
{empty} +
As such, if we first add a task to Horo, then we call the `help` command, calling `undo` will ignore the `help` command and proceed
to revert Horo to before a task was added. +
{empty} +
*The `undo` command only executes if there are previous states to revert back to.* +
{empty} +
If no command has been previously executed, or if Horo has already been reverted to the earliest possible state by multiple `undos`,
then calling `undo` further will amount to no effect.

==== Redo

.Redo Command
image::RedoCommandScreenShot.png[]

The `redo` command redoes a previously undone command.
The `redo` command is able to redo any undone commands that have not been succeeded by a separate state-changing command
(e.g. add_event, delete_event, edit).

If you had executed any state-changing command (except for `undo` or `redo`) just after undoing the `add_event` command,
calling redo will then amount to no effect.

If you've ever used another application with undo-redo functionality, just imagine that Horo's undo-redo functions are as intuitive as theirs.


Command Format: +
`*redo*`


Illustration:
Suppose that you wrongly deleted task 3 from the list, but actually wanted to delete task 2 instead.
As a result, you type in the `undo` command, and Horo is restored to the previous state where task 3 still exists.

However, now you decide that you want to remove task 3 from the list after all. Without having to key in the `delete_task` command,
you can simply type in `redo` and the most recent command that was undone (the deletion of task 3) will be re-executed.
This results in a list where task 3 is deleted.

To redo:

1. Type redo in the command box, and press the Enter key to execute it. +

.`redo` command in the Command Box
image::undoScenario4.png[]

{empty} +
2. The result box will display the message "Previous undone command has been redone!" +

.Feedback for the `redo` command
image::undoScenario5.png[]

{empty} +
3. You can see that task 3 has been removed from the list. +

.Result of the `redo` command
image::undoScenario6.png[]

[NOTE]
*The `redo` command redoes previously undone commands in reverse chronological order.* +
{empty} +
Suppose that you have executed the following commands in this order: +
{empty} +
1.	Adding a task +
2.	Editing a task +
{empty} +
As discussed in Undoing a previous command, if we run `undo` twice, we will revert Horo to before a task was edited,
and then revert Horo to before a task was added. +
Our sequence of `undo` commands are in this order: +
{empty} +
1.	Undo editing of a task +
2.	Undo adding of a task +
{empty} +
Now, if we run the `redo` command, Horo will be restored to the state after the task was added. If we execute redo again,
Horo will be restored to the state after the task was edited. +
{empty} +
*The `redo` command only executes if the most recent state-changing command(s) are undo commands.* +
{empty} +
If no `undo` command has been executed since the starting up of Horo, or `undo` commands have been executed
but other state-changing commands were executed after those `undos`, then executing the `redo` command amounts to no effect. +
{empty} +
For example, let's say I deleted a task from the list, undid that deletion, and then added another task to the list.
Executing the `redo` command here will not do anything because `add_task` was executed after the `undo`.

// tag::ics[]
=== iCalendar (ICS) Integration

Horo stores data in the ICS format. Files saved in this format have the extension `.ics`.
This allows for data to be imported from and exported to other calendar applications that also use the `.ics` format.

This means you can export and import your calendar events and todo items straight from Google Calendar into Horo,
and vice versa!
It also means that you can export and import your save data between different machines running Horo.

==== Export Current Data

.Export Command
image::ExportCommandScreenShot.png[]

.Exported File
image::ExportFileScreenShot.png[]

The `export` command exports your current calendar as an ICS file to the specified directory.
If no directory is specified, the file will be created in the same directory as Horo.

If you want to export the ICS file to a certain directory like your desktop,
all you have to do is specify it with the `*--directory*` parameter.

Command Format: +
`*export*` +
`*export* *--directory* DIRECTORY`

Example: +
`*export* *--directory* "C:\Users\USER_NAME\Desktop\Horo"`

==== Import other ICS Data


.Imported File
image::ImportFileScreenShot.png[]

.Import Command
image::ImportCommandScreenShot.png[]

The `import` command imports an ICS file from the specified filepath.

Command Format: +
`*import* FILEPATH`

Example: +
`*import* "C:\Users\USER_NAME\Desktop\OtherCalendars\Others.ics"`
// end::ics[]

=== Exiting the program

Exits the program.

Command Format: +
`*exit*`


== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with Horo's save file.
