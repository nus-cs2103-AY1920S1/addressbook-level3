== PROJECT: SplitWiser

---

== Overview

For our Software Engineering module, we were tasked to morph a base _Address Book 3_ (AB3) application into a product we envisioned for a specific target audience.

Our team decided to work on **SplitWiser**, a desktop Java applet to simplify expense tracking and bill-splitting amongst friends in group activities.

**SplitWiser** allows users to manage their contacts and activities centrally, and is primarily designed for fast typists in mind. The app employs a familiar command-line interface (CLI) for input reminiscent of terminal shells, and provides feedback to the user via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed with JavaFX.

My primary responsibility was to design and implement all GUI-related commands, with the requisite GUI components and styles. This role is particularly crucial, since the GUI bridges the gap between the inner workings of the app and what is seen by the end-user. As a cohesive and responsive GUI is critical to the the user experience (UX) of the app, my work heavily builds upon the GUI provided by AB3.

The following sections detail my contributions in greater depth, alongside the documentation I have written for my enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major enhancements

* *Reworked List command* (PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/112[#112]): Added the ability to view a list of contacts or activities.
** *What it does*: The `list` command was reworked to allow the user to specify either the list of tracked contacts or activities for the app to display.
** *Justification*: This feature supports the centralised management of both contacts and activities, as the lists show a high-level overview of each entry. This allows users to use the `view` command in tandem to display full details of an entry, and enables certain contextual commands (`find` and `delete`) to behave differently depending on which list the user is currently viewing.
** *Highlights*: The `list` command can be used from any context. However, its implementation was challenging due to the high level of coordination between multiple components of the app (UI, Model and Logic), since all these components must share a consistent view of the current context.
** *Credits*: to fellow team member _Lee Liak Ghee_ for implementing our initial design for a `Context` class to represent the active state of the app.

* *View command* (PRs https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/124[#124], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/205[#205]): Added the ability to view details of a particular contact or activity.
** *What it does*: The `view` command allows the user to bring up the details panel for a specified entry (activity or contact) in the currently viewed list.
** *Justification*: Due to the limited size of the list entries, the full information of each contact or activity is only displayed in the respective details panel. This reduces visual clutter in the list view and provides additional freedom to customise each details panel separately. It also enables many contextual commands (`expense`, `invite`, `disinvite`, `settle`, `edit` and `delete`), which function based on the currently viewed entry. This eliminates the need to manually input the entry each command operates on, reducing the amount of typing and thus improving the UX.
** *Highlights*: The details panel displayed by the `view` command also provides the user with these additional features:
*** Contact details panel: shows the activity history of the contact and the aggregate amount owed for each 
*** Activity details panel: shows the total expenditure in an activity
*** Activity details panel: greys out soft-deleted expenses and settlements
*** Activity details panel: shows required transfers to clear all debt within the activity

=== Minor enhancements

* *GUI redesign* (PRs https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/86[#86], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/124[#124]): Redesigned the entire GUI to align with our `v2.0` vision of the app.
** *What it does*: The GUI was redesigned around a single-panel interface with a light theme, shared by different UI components. New UI classes were introduced as required and the stylesheets were re-organised.
** *Justification*: This enhancement improves the cohesiveness of the GUI across different operating systems (OS), and ensures it is responsive to user commands.
** *Highlights*: Ensuring the GUI appears visually similar across different OSes was technically challenging, due to the poor documentation of the JavaFX CSS and FXML standard. This enhancement required a significant amount of manual user testing on different OSes.

* *Improved status bar* (PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/206[#206]): Reworked the status bar to be more useful to users.
** *What it does*: Upon initial app launch, the status bar will display the file path to the data file. After that, the status bar will instead describe the current application context.
** *Justification*: By displaying the current context, this improves the UX by minimising the chance a user enters a command that is not defined for the current context.
