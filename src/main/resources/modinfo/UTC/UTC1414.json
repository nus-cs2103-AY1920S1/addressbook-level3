The founding of the Botanic Gardens and LKCNHM are set in this historical context. This module explores the value of science and biodiversity research in the region. Students will apply and share this knowledge with the wider community by conceptualising an educational tour of LKCNHM, and help inspire a new found commitment to the natural world amongst urban Singaporeans.",
