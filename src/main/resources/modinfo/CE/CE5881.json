    "description": "The main objective of this course is to introduce fundamental principles of soil dynamics and applications to construction vibrations. Construction activities inevitably introduce vibrations in the ambient environment and the sub-surface geological formations. These are usually experienced as noise and vibrations, and may also take the form of stress waves in soils and rocks which could damage foundation structures. Case studies will used to illustrate construction vibrations issues and applicable mitigation techniques. Students will also be required to undertake and complete a Group Project. Students are free to discuss and agree with the Lecturers on their choice of topic.",
