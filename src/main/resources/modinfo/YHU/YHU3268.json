    "description": "This course focuses on the history of the Japanese empire from 1868 to 1945. Whilst consolidating the knowledge of the Japanese empire, this course aims to develop critical thinking on existing historiography, by thinking about limitations of traditional historiography, whilst exploring new approaches emerging in the field. Why do debates on empire sit uncomfortably with the literature on nationalism? What are imperial and trans-imperial agents and practices? We examine themes such as migration, citizenship, religion, development, settler communities, trade, experts, and outlaws. What was the role of \u2018culture\u2019 as a constructed ideology to connect diverse local contexts?",
