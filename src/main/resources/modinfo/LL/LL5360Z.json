    "description": "This module will focus on the current challenges faced by investment arbitration at the global level. It will adopt a three-step approach. Students will first acquire an in-depth understanding of the history and functioning of the existing system. On this basis, the different criticisms and reform proposals will be scrutinized. Finally, students will be invited to make their own informed assessment of the existing system, to discuss its evolution and debate possible improvements. The module will be diversified, as it will address both legal and extra-legal issues. Seminars will be interactive and students will be encouraged to participate actively.",
