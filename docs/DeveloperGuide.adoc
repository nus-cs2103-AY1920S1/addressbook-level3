== Introduction
Welcome to ORGANice! ORGANice is an organ transplant manager desktop application
specifically designed for hospital administration staff who prefer typing.

=== Purpose
This guide documents the software design and considerations
made during the development of ORGANice.

=== Intended audience
This guide is meant for developers who would like to further develop ORGANice.

== Setting up

To set up the developer tools needed to develop ORGANice, refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section provides a high-level overview of ORGANice's codebase.
It is divided into 6 subsections:

* Architecture
* UI component
* Logic component
* Model component
* Storage component
* Common classes

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The Architecture section is meant to explain the high-level design of ORGANice.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The `main` folder contains two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for performing the following tasks:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. For example,
the `LogsCenter` class is in the `Commons` collection because it is used by many classes
to write log messages to the ORGANice's log file.

The rest of ORGANice consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario when a user
issues the command `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim`.

.Component interactions for `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section explains the design of the UI component. +
Figure 4 below depicts the classes in the UI component and their relationships with one another.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section explains the design of the Logic component. +
Figure 5 below depicts the classes in the Logic component and their relationships with one  another.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit ic/S5678908D n/Mr Lim")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit S5678908D n/Mr Lim` Command
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `organice.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Matching feature
This section describes how the matching feature is implemented. The changes to Logic, UI and Model will be
explained, followed by an explanation of design considerations.

==== Logic of Matching
This section explains the logic of matching.

Matching is done by implementing the `MatchCommand#match(Person donor, Patient patient)` method. It takes in a Donor
object and a Patient object, which represents a donor and a patient respectively. The method returns true if the patient
and donor are a match, and false otherwise. The code for the `match` method is shown below:
```
public static boolean match(Person donor, Patient patient) {
    if (!(donor instanceof Donor)) {
        return false;
    }

    BloodType donorBloodType = ((Donor) donor).getBloodType();
    BloodType patientBloodType = patient.getBloodType();

    TissueType donorTissueType = ((Donor) donor).getTissueType();
    TissueType patientTissueType = patient.getTissueType();

    Double successRate = donorTissueType.getPercentageMatch(patientTissueType);

    if (patientBloodType.isBloodTypeMatch(donorBloodType) && successRate >= SUCCESSFUL_PERCENTAGE) {
        Donor donorToSet = (Donor) donor;
        donorToSet.addMatchResult(patient.getNric(), successRate);
        donorToSet.setSuccessRate(patient.getNric());
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

This `match` method is used in `ModelManager` to find matches. The following methods
in `ModelManager` accesses the `match` method:

* `ModelManager#matchDonors(Patient patient)` -- Matches all donors in ORGANice with the specified patient.
For each donor that matches the patient, a `MatchedDonor` object is created and stored.
* `ModelManager#matchPatients()` -- Matches all donors with all patients. For every patient in ORGANice,
a `MatchedPatient` object is created to store the number of donors that matches that patient.

`MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects are stored in an `ObservableList` called
`listOfMatches`. This `ObservableList` can be accessed by `Logic` and displayed by the `UI`
component.

==== UI of Matching
This section explains the UI design of the matching feature.

After the match command is invoked, a `CommandResult` object is returned.
The `MainWindow` decides which list to display via an if-else block. The code snippet below
shows the if-else block:
```
    if (commandResult.isMatch()) {
        handleMatch();
    } else {
        handleNonMatches();
    }
```

`handleMatch()` and `handleNonMatches()` are in the `MainWindow` class. The `handleMatch()` method
selects the `listOfMatches` list to display, while the `handleNonMatches()` method selects the
`filteredPersons` list to display.

All lists are displayed in a `PersonListPanel`. This is a custom UI component that inherits the `UiPart<Region>` class.
The constructor of `PersonListPanel` takes in an `ObservableList<Person>` object and creates
 a list of `PersonListViewCell` objects to be displayed.

The `updateItem(Person person, boolean empty)` method displays the `MatchedDonor` and
`MatchedPatient` objects available in the `ObservableList<Person>` object. The following is the code snippet for
`#updateItem()`:
```
protected void updateItem(Person person, boolean empty) {
    super.updateItem(person, empty);
    if (empty || person == null) {
        setGraphic(null);
        setText(null);
    } else {
        if (person instanceof Doctor) {
            setGraphic(new DoctorCard((Doctor) person, getIndex() + 1).getRoot());
        } else if (person instanceof MatchedDonor) {
            setGraphic(new MatchCard((Donor) person, getIndex() + 1).getRoot());
        } else if (person instanceof Donor) {
            setGraphic(new DonorCard((Donor) person, getIndex() + 1).getRoot());
        } else if (person instanceof MatchedPatient) {
            setGraphic(new NumberOfMatches((MatchedPatient) person, getIndex() + 1).getRoot());
        } else if (person instanceof Patient) {
            setGraphic(new PatientCard((Patient) person, getIndex() + 1).getRoot());
        } else {
            setGraphic(new PersonCard(person, getIndex() + 1).getRoot());
        }
    }
}
```

==== Model of Matching
This section will discuss aspects of the match feature that interacts with the `Model` component.

As explained earlier, `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects store
match results for a specific donor and patient respectively. Each time
the match command is invoked, previous `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects
will be removed from the list.

`MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects only exist in-memory and will not be saved to the hard disk.
This means that data stored in `MatchedDonor` and `MatchedPatient` objects will not be accessible
in the next app launch.

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Bugs introduced
This section explains why the current implementation is chosen.
Previously, the matching feature was implemented by storing match results in the
`Patient` and `Donor` objects.

Each `Patient` and `Donor` has a `isMatch()` method, which checks if the match results should be displayed
or if the `Patient` and `Donor` attributes should be displayed. The match results will be displayed when `isMatch()`
evaluates to `true`.

It was discovered that there were many bugs introduced via this approach. The root cause of the bugs could not be
identified. {Link to bug report}

===== Aspect: Non-persistence of match results
This section explains why the match results are not stored.

One reason is to ensure that all objects in the `listOfMatches` ObservableList are different after
executing a match command. This ensures that the `updateItem()` method would be called to
update the `PersonListPanel` display.

Another reason is to override previous match results with new results from the latest match command.
A scenario in which this would be important is if a user matches a patient, edits the patient information,
then runs the matching again. The matching would be based on the latest patient data.

// tag::formmode[]
=== Add person `Form` mode feature
This section explains the implementation of the adding person in `Form` mode feature.

==== Implementation

The `Form` mode mechanism is facilitated by `FormUiManager`.
It modifies the `CommandBox` as well as `PersonPanelListPlaceholder` each time a user input a specific attribute.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FormUiManager#getPersonField()` -- Modifies `CommandBox` and prompts the user to input a specific attribute.
* `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` -- Sets the value for all required attributes of a specific type of person.
* `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()` -- Adds a doctor to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()` -- Adds a patient to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` -- Adds a donor to the person list.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface when the specific command is invoked by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Form` mode mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add t/doctor` command to add a doctor in a `Form` mode. The `add` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` that will return a new `AddCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` executes the command and notice that the `Command` is a `Form` type command and thus will create a new `FormUiManager` instance.

Step 4. The `FormUiManager` changes the display of the application based on the type of the person specified in Step 1 by modifying the content of the `PersonListPanelPlaceholder` as well as the `CommandExecutor` in the `CommandBox` object by calling `FormUiManager#getPersonFields()`.

Step 5. The user inputs the attribute that is prompted until all the required attributes are specified.

Step 6. The user confirms the details of the person and `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` will be called and depending on the type of the person specified, calling `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` respectively.

Step 7. `FormUiManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to add the person and save it in the `Storage` interface.

==== Design Considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same `add` command to do the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May not be the best approach since one command will have two different modes.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new command for the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Will be less confusing for the user since there is a separate command for `Form` mode
** Cons: We must creates a new parser and command classes just to deal with another `add` functionality.

// tag::dataencryption[]

=== Sort feature
This section describes how the sort feature is implemented.

Sorting is done by using `Comparators` in the `Logic` component.

To facilitate the sorting, the following methods were added:

{More to be added}

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for the interactions with the `Logic` component for the `execute(sort/rate)`

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect:

=== Processing feature
This section describes how the processing feature is implemented.

Processing is done by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`, then creating an ArrayList named, `ProcessingList` to store the tasks needed to do.

If the donor and patient pair had never been processed before, a default `ProcessingList` will be generated and it will belong to the patient and donor pair uniquely.

If the user made any changes to the `ProcessingList`, the list will be saved to the donor as one of its attribute which takes in a parameter of the patient's NRIC.

//Todo: additional feature such as add tasks, delete tasks etc

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Method of storing the `ProcessingList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use ArrayList to store the tasks.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: It is not the most efficient algorithm and the huge number of `ProcessingList` may take up a huge datafile at the end of the day.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new class that works like ArrayList.
** Pros: Able to implement more specific methods for the ProcessingList.
** Cons: More methods and test cases needed and it is harder to implement.

=== Finding feature
This section explains the implementation of the find persons by attributes feature.

==== Current Implementation
The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate`. +

===== FindCommand

`FindCommand` extends `Command` with a `predicate` that is used to determine whether a given `person` should be
displayed. It implements `Command#execute(Model model)` which replaces the `predicate` of the current
`model.filteredPersons` with the input predicate of `FindCommand`, which triggers an update *INSERT JAVAFX STUFF. +

TODO

===== PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate

TODO

===== Execution Behaviour
The behaviour of `FindCommand` is consistent with that of other commands as described in <<Design-Logic>>. Therefore,
this section will gloss over higher-level details and instead zoom-in to the behaviour of `FindCommand#execute`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the behaviour of `#execute` at each step. +

Step 1: The user inputs a find command, e.g. `find n/Alice Carl Elle t/doctor donor`. It is parsed by
`FindCommandParser` and used to create an `ArgumentMultimap`: `argMultimap`.

Step 2: `argMultimap` is used to initialize a `PersonContainsPrefixesPredicate` object: `predicate`.

Step 3: `predicate` is used to initialize a `FindCommand` object. `#execute` is then called on it.

Step 4: `#execute` calls the `#updateFilteredPersonList` of the current `Model` which causes it's
`FilteredList<Person>`: `filteredPersons` to automatically remove `persons` that fail `predicate#test`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates steps x to y: +

==== Design Considerations


=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
