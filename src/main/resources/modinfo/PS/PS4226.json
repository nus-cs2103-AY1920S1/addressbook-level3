    "description": "This module offers a close study of emerging markets as rising powers that shape the governance of international economic exchange. The module is organized around two core questions: where are the emerging economies, and why are they important? The course emphasizes a dynamic definition of emerging markets that reflects the ongoing 'power shift' in the global economy, including but not limited to countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The module takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on political science and economics scholarship to examine emerging markets in international trade and investment, global financial governance, and foreign aid.",
