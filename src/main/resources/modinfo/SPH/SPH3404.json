    "description": "Being active and less sedentary are cornerstones of health promotion as these behaviours are strongly linked to health. Unfortunately, physical inactivity and too much sitting are the norm in our modern world. In this module we will examine the relationship between physical activity/sedentary behaviour and health, look into various approaches to measuring physical activity/sedentary behaviour and highlight multiple ways to change these behaviours. This will include looking at various levels of influence. Students will also be exposed to technology-driven approaches in various domains of physical activity/sedentary behaviour research and practice.",
