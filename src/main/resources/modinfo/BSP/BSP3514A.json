    "description": "This course is designed to prepare students to represent NUS at international business case competitions that involve undergraduate students from schools worldwide. In the last several years, NUS Business students have performed admirably in numerous case competitions held at such institutions as University of Texas, University of Washington, Copenhagen Business School, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Thamassat University, McGill University, University of Western Ontario and University of Southern California. In addition, NUS students have performed well at related competitions, such as the LOreal business challenge. Each of these competitions was international and included teams from leading business schools around the world, including Wharton, Michigan, UCLA and USC. The teams of NUS students from previous years have clearly established that NUS can compete on an equal, if not superior level, to the teams of students from these schools. With that in mind, our goal at the end of this course is to have developed and refined the skills necessary to succeed at the highest level in these international business case competitions. To meet that goal, this course takes a practical and applied approach to the development of case analysis skills. The course consists of a series of business cases that will be analyzed by student teams. After analysis, the teams will present the cases to their classmates and to the faculty who have selected the case to be analyzed. The faculty member(s) reviewing the case will provide feedback on the presentations, as will the other members of the class. The goal of this process is to provide constructive critiques of the groups and individuals performances in the case analysis and presentations.",
