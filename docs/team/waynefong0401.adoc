== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the feature to undo/redo commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** added a history command that allows the user to view all the previous commands.
** added a feature that allows the user to to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
