    "description": "This module introduces students to the mechanisms of history writing. Students will examine how historians and their milieu mutually act on each other; how history can shape the visions of historians and how historians perceive and mould history as we know it. They will find that this module builds upon existing knowledge of Chinese history and will broaden their horizons in a number of related fields of study, including traditional China, modern China, and historical philosophy. This course is offered to graduate students with adequate knowledge of Chinese history.",
