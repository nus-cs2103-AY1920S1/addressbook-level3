== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exerecise/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete t/exercise i/1`.

.Component interactions for `delete t/exercise i/1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExerciseListPanel`, `ExerciseCard` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ExerciseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an exercise/regime).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `PropertyBook` object that represents the custom properties defined by the user.
* stores a `ExerciseBook` object that represents the user's exercises being tracked.
* stores a `ExerciseDatabaseBook` object that represents the database of exercises in ExerHealth.
* stores a `RegimeBook` object that represents the user's regimes.
* stores a `ScheduleBook` object that represents the user's schedules.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Resource Book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Property Book data in json format and read it back.
[NOTE]
Resource Book data consists of Exercise Book, Regime Book and Schedule Book data


[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.exercise.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the `events` package consisting of `EventHistory`, `EventFactory`,
`EventPayload` and the various `Event` classes.

The `EventHistory` is a singleton class used to store a history of successfully executed commands as `Event` objects.
Instances of `Event` are stored in either the `undoStack` or the `redoStack` depending on the user's course of action.

The `EventHistory` class has two primary methods namely `undo(Model model)` and `redo(Model model)`:

* `eventHistory.undo(model)` -- Undoes the `Event` at the top of the `undoStack`, executes it, and pushes it to the top of the `redoStack`
* `eventHistory.redo(model)` -- Redoes the `Event` at the top of the `redoStack`, executes it, and pushes it to the top of the `undoStack`

These operations are utilised in the `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` respectively.

The following steps will describe the steps taken in the execution of an UndoableCommand, and subsequently
the UndoCommand and RedoCommand.

*Step 1:* When an `UndoableCommand` is executed, key information used during the command will be added into a
newly initialized `EventPayload`.
[NOTE]
The `EventPayload` is a wrapper class to store key information about the particular command.
For instance, if an `EditCommand` has been executed, the `EventPayload` will store the `originalExercise`
as well as the `editedExercise`.

*Step 2:* The `EventFactory` takes in the `UndoableCommand` and generates an `Event` using the `EventPayload`
stored in the `UndoableCommand`.
The `Event` is then added to the undo stack of the `EventHistory`.
[NOTE]
The `EventFactory` checks for the command word of the `UndoableCommand` to decide which specific `Event` object
to generate. It will then obtain the `EventPayload` from the `UndoableCommand` and pass it into the constructor of the
`Event` so that the `Event` captures the key information of the `UndoableCommand`.

*Step 3:* To undo the latest `UndoableCommand` the user executes the `UndoCommand` by entering `undo`
into the command box.

*Step 4:* The `UndoCommand` executes `eventHistory.undo(model)`, which prompts the `EventHistory` instance
to pop the next `Event` to undo from the undo stack. Once the `Event` is undone, it will be pushed to the
top of the redo stack.

*Step 5:* To redo the command that has been undone, the user executes the `RedoCommand`. This execution
behaves similarly to step 4, except that the next `Event` is taken from the top of the redo stack and
pushed to the undo stack instead.
[NOTE]
In steps 4 and 5, if any of the respective stack is empty when undo or redo is called, a `CommandException` will be thrown
and an error message will be displayed to indicate there is no undoable or redoable commands.

The following two Sequence Diagrams show a sample flow of the execution when an `EditCommand`, which is an
`UndoableCommand`, has been executed and subsequently undone.

The first diagram describes the process of storing an `EditEvent` to `EventHistory` during the execution of the
`EditCommand`. The `EventPayload` is only initialized when the `EditCommand` is executed. The `EventPayload` is
subsequently used for the initialization of the `EditEvent`.

.The process of storing an EditEvent to EventHistory
image::UndoableCommandSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

The second diagram here describes the process of undoing the `EditCommand` executed above using the `UndoCommand`.
When the `UndoCommand` is executed, the `EventHistory` calls the `undo` method of the next `Event` in the undo stack
(i.e. the `EditEvent`).

.The process of undoing the EditCommand
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

Given below is a Class Diagram to show the associations between Event, Command and Model. It is specifically designed
such that only objects that implement the `Event` and `Command` interface will need to handle the `model` class.
[NOTE]
The only commands that implements the `UndoableCommand` are `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `EditCommand`,
`ClearCommand`, `ScheduleCommand` and `ResolveCommand`. They each stores an `EventPayload` instance.

The following Activity Diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters undoable commands,
the undo command and the redo command.

.The workflow when a user enters an undoable command and performs undo/redo
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Choice 1: (current choice)** Implements undo and redo of each Command in a separate Event object stored in the EventHistory
** Pros:
*** Uses less memory to store Event objects and payloads as compared to entire copies of the Model object.
*** Open for extensions and close to modifications as the Event interface only contains undo and redo methods, and can
be easily implemented when new Undoable commands are introduced.
** Cons:
*** UndoableCommand objects are forced to depend on EventPayloads when it does not actually use it directly.
(e.g. `DeleteCommand` has to store the exercise being deleted despite using it only once).

* **Choice 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros:
*** Uses less memory to store each command as compared to entire copies of the Model object.
** Cons:
*** Violates Single Responsibility Principle as Commands need to contain specific implementation of the inverse action of itself
and also stores data such as the exercise being deleted in a local field.

* **Choice 3:** Saves the entire model consisting of the exercise, regime, schedule and suggestion lists.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
** Cons:
*** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as multiple lists need to be stored
(i.e. Exercise list, Regime list, Schedule list)
*** Unnecessary storage of irrelevant details such as suggestion list.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Choice 1 (current choice):** Use a singleton EventHistory to store stacks of Events generated by a EventFactory.
** Pros:
*** Ensures only one instance of EventHistory exists
*** The EventFactory relies on the Factory pattern that helps to reduce coupling between
EventHistory and each individual Event.
** Cons:
*** The Singleton pattern may have a chance of breaking if multiple threads initialize the singleton class
at the same time, creating multiple instances of EventHistory. However, if this problem arises, the instantiation
method can be made "synchronized" to circumvent this issue.

* **Choice 2:** Use a list to store the history of model objects.
** Pros:
*** Very simple to implement as each step simply requires a deep copy of the model to be created
and stored.
** Cons:
*** Difficult to monitor multiple resource books (e.g. Regime books and Exercise books) as they all
manage different types of resources that can be altered by commands.
// end::undoredo[]
==== Design Patterns

The Undo/Redo feature implementation is based on the Singleton, Command, and Factory design patterns

* *Singleton*
** To help ensure that only one instance of `EventHistory` exists during the execution of the program
** Allows easier access by the various command classes (i.e. the UndoableCommands, UndoCommand and RedoCommand)

* *Command*
** Extensions of new `Event` is easy and can be done without significant changes to the existing code

* *Factory*
** Suitable for the context of taking in a particular Command and returning a corresponding Event
** Reduces coupling between Command classes and Event classes


// tag::resolvefeature[]

=== Resolve feature
==== Rationale
There are multiple times where if the user wishes to schedule a regime, they find themselves in trouble over which kind of exercise regime they can fit into their schedule. The motivation behind this feature is so that users can customise their own schedules to their own liking. The alternative of an auto scheduler will restrict users from having the regime of their liking be scheduled. Instead of forcing users to adhere to some pre-generated resolution, we allow the users to make their own choice and choose their own exercise regime to be scheduled.

==== Implementation
The resolve feature is used when there is a scheduling conflict that happens within ExerHealth. This feature will alter the state of the program. The state is known by `MainApp` and it is either `State.IN_CONFLICT` or `State.NORMAL`. Only when the state is `State.IN_CONFLICT` will `resolve` commands be allowed.

For the implementation of the resolve feature, the `ResolveCommand` will hold a `Conflict` object which is then passed into `Model`. The concrete implementation, `ModelManager` then resolves the conflict that is being held there. Each `Conflict` object will hold 1 conflicting `schedule` and 1 `schedule` that was originally scheduled on the date.

Shown below is the class diagram for the implementation of the `Resolve` feature.

.Class diagram for Resolve Command
image::ScheduleResolveClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

With regards to the flow of the program for a scheduling conflict, the steps are laid out below:

Step 1. User enters a `schedule` command that will cause a scheduling conflict. The `ScheduleCommand` will change `MainApp` state to `State.IN_CONFLICT`.

[NOTE]
`schedule` can conflict with another `schedule` when the dates from the 2 schedules are the same. The method `model.hasSchedule()` returns `true` if that happens.

Step 2. A `CommandResult` object is returned to `MainWindow` where the flag `showResolve` is set to `true`.

Step 3. Upon receipt of the object, `MainWindow` will show the resolve window and the user is required to resolve the conflict.

[NOTE]
The `ResolveWindow` will block all inputs to `MainWindow` and only allow `resolve` command to be entered.

Shown below is the sequence diagram for when a scheduling conflict happens:

.Sequence diagram when a scheduling conflict happens
image::ScheduleConflict.png[align="center"]

Step 5. When the user is prompted with the `ResolveWindow`, all the conflicting exercises will be shown in one page. The previously `scheduled regime` on the left and the `conflicting regime` on the right.

Step 6. Once the user issue a `resolve` command correctly, the `model` and `storage` of ExerHealth will be updated to reflect the changes. A new regime will be added for the user from the `resolve`.

[NOTE]
The `ResolveWindow` will only take one valid `resolve` command and `Ui` will close the `ResolveWindow` immediately after the command finishes. The newly made schedule will result in a new `regime` being added to the user's `RegimeList`, so the name of the `regime` in the `resolve` command cannot have any conflicts with current names in `RegimeList`.

Step 7. The `ResolveWindow` then closes upon successful `resolve` and the application continues.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a `schedule` command:

.Activity diagram for when a user enters a `schedule` command
image::ScheduleActivityDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Signalling Schedule Conflict
* **Choice 1 (current choice): ** Using `CommandResult` object
** Pros:
*** Makes use of existing objects in codebase making it easier to implement
*** UI does not have to handle logic when encountering schedule conflicts. It only has to show the `ResolveWindow` and pass the data accordingly.
** Cons:
*** If we have to signal different types of outcomes to the UI, the `CommandResult` class will become bloated.

* **Choice 2: ** throw `ScheduleException`
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement. `ScheduleCommand` just has to throw an exception and `UI` catches it.
** Cons:
*** `UI's` execute methods will contain multiple `try/catch` which acts like a control flow mechanism which increases code smell.
*** If there is a need to pass down information from executed Commands, an exception is unable to convey any sort of complex information that the `UI` can act on. Thus, encapsulating information in an object will be more open to extension compared to throwing an exception.

// end::resolvefeature[]

//tag::customfeature[]
=== Custom feature

==== Rationale
A quick conversation with a few of our friends revealed that there are many properties which they intend to keep track
for exercises. However, it is unlikely that we can implement all of these properties for the exercises as there may
be too much overhead and we can never be certain that we have met all of the users' needs.

==== Overview
This feature is facilitated by both `PropertyBook` and `CustomProperty`. Whenever a user
adds a newly defined custom property, a `CustomProperty` object will be created which is stored in
`PropertyBook`. Its corresponding prefix and full name will be tracked by `PropertyBook` to avoid
clashes in their uses.

==== Current Implementation
`CustomProperty` encapsulates a single custom property that the user defines. It contains
information such as name, prefix and parameter type of the custom property. The parameter type is supported by
an enumeration class ``ParameterType`` and is restricted to one of the following 3 types: ``Number``, ``Text``, ``Date``.

`PropertyBook` serves as a singleton class that helps to manage all of the custom properties that have been
defined by the user. This class acts as an access point for any information relating to the creation or deletion
of custom properties.

To keep track of the custom properties and its relevant information, the following are used:

1. `customProperties`: A set containing all of the `CustomProperty` objects that
have been created.

2. `customPrefixes`: A set containing all of the `Prefix` objects associated with existing custom
properties.

3. `customFullNames`: A set containing the full names of the existing custom properties.

4. `defaultPrefixes`: A set containing all of the `Prefix` objects associated with default properties and parameter
types.

5. `defaultFullNames`: A set containing all of the full names of default properties.

Custom names and prefixes are separated from its default counterparts to ensure that the default names and prefixes
will always be present when the `PropertyBook` is first initialised.

To help facilitate `PropertyBook` in its custom properties management, the following main methods are implemented:

1. `PropertyBook#isPrefixUsed(Prefix)`: Checks if the given prefix has been used by a default or custom property.

2. `PropertyBook#isFullNameUsed(String)`: Checks if the given name has been used by a default or custom property.

3. `PropertyBook#isFullNameUsedByCustomProperty(String)`: Checks if the given name has been used by a custom property

4. `PropertyBook#addCustomProperty(CustomProperty)`: Adds the new custom property. Each time a custom property is
added, the prefix set in `CliSyntax` is also updated.

5. `PropertyBook#removeCustomProperty(CustomProperty)`: Removes a pre-defined custom property. Its associated prefix
is also removed from the prefix set in `CliSyntax`.

All of the crucial associations mentioned above are summarised in the next class diagram.

.Class diagram of the associations of `PropertyBook` and `CustomProperty`
image::CustomClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

===== Adding Custom Properties
To add a new custom property for the exercises, the user can do it through the command `custom s/PREFIX_NAME f/FULL_NAME
p/PARAMETER_TYPE`. Examples include `custom s/r f/Rating p/Number` and `custom s/ed f/Ending Date p/Date`.

The following sequence diagram will illustrate how the custom operation works when a custom
property is *successfully added*.

.Sequence diagram of a successful addition of a custom property
image::EditedCustomAddSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

For further clarity, one can identify the above diagram with the following sequence of steps:

*Step 1:* User first defines the custom property they wish to add for the exercises.

*Step 2:* The custom property will be parsed by the app's parser and a new `CustomProperty`
object is created.

*Step 3:* This `CustomProperty` object will be returned together with a newly created `CustomAddCommand` object.

*Step 4:* The `execute` method of the `CustomAddCommand` method will be called and the `CustomProperty` object
will be added to `PropertyBook`.

*Step 5:* Finally, a `CommandResult` object will be created and returned.

The above steps illustrate the main success scenario. However, not all additions of a custom property will be successful.
The next activity diagram shows the workflow when a new custom property is defined.

.Activity diagram of the workflow when a new custom property is added
image::CustomAddActivityDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

Once a custom property is successfully added into `PropertyBook`, the user can use the prefix of the custom property in
`add` or `edit` command.

===== Removing Custom Properties
Should a user wish to remove a custom property from all of the exercises, he/she can simply make use of the command
`custom rm/FULL_NAME`. A custom property that has been removed from the ``PropertyBook`` can be re-added back if the user chooses to.
Alternatively, if the user wishes to remove a custom property just from a single exercise, he/she can choose to enter `custom rm/FULL_NAME i/INDEX` instead.

The next sequence diagram illustrates what happens when a custom property is removed from the `PropertyBook`. If a custom property
is removed from a single exercise instead, only the selected exercise will be updated.

.Sequence diagram of a successful removal of a custom property from all exercises
image::EditedCustomRemoveSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: `PropertyBook` design
* **Choice 1 (Current choice)**: Represent `PropertyBook` as a singleton class that will
act as the only access point for the addition and removal of custom properties.
** Pros: Having a singleton helps to provide more utility for methods that rely on the `CustomProperty` objects that have been
created.
** Cons: It makes testing much difficult as the results from the previous test cases are carried over. Furthermore,
it increases coupling across the code base.

* **Choice 2**: Represent `PropertyBook` as a usual Java object that can be instantiated many times.
** Pros: This reduces coupling and makes testing easier as a new `PropertyBook` object independent of the other tests
can be created for different tests.
** Cons: There could be situations where 2 instances of `PropertyBook` objects are created and the addition of a
custom property is done to only one instance and not in the other.

After much consideration, Choice 1 was implemented with the following reasons:

1. `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` have to gain access to the `CustomProperty` in order to ensure that the values entered
for the custom properties in the add/edit commands are valid. However, as the `ExerciseBookParser` in the original code base only takes in a
`String` as a parameter, there has to be another way of retrieving the custom properties. While we can change the
`ExerciseBookParser` to take in a data structure containing `CustomProperty` objects, this does not seem good as its responsibility
is just to ensure that a predefined command is entered and is passed to the correct command parser.A slightly better choice in this case is to make the data structure holding the `CustomProperty` objects a static variable and parsers that require it can access
it directly.

2. If the data structure holding the `CustomProperty` object is to be made static, it means that this information is
shared among all of the `PropertyBook` instances if Choice 2 was implemented. Thus, `PropertyBook`
is acting like a singleton and so, a singleton class will be appropriate.

//end::customfeature[]

// tag::suggest[]
=== Suggest

==== Rationale
Beginners now have a plethora of choices, which may overwhelm them when they are deciding on what exercises to do.
Thus, we decided to provide users with sample exercise routines to reduce the inertia of starting this lifestyle change.
On the other hand, regular gym goers may face a repetitive and mundane exercise routine or may want to experiment with different exercises.
As such, to put it briefly, we decided to give users the ability to discover exercises based on the characteristics they are interested in.

This feature presents a cohesive function that all users can benefit from.
It also makes our application well-rounded so that users can better achieve their fitness goals.

==== Overview
The sample exercise routines are currently implemented in ExerHealth's database as a hard-coded set of exercises.
More importantly, the `SuggestPossible` command which caters to more experienced gym goers utilises the exercises that the user
has already done, in addition to ExerHealth's database. Hence, we allow users to search for suggestions
based on `Muscle` and `CustomProperty`.

==== Current Implementation
The `SuggestBasic` command displays a list of exercises from our database to the user.
The `SuggestPossible` command is created by parsing the user's inputs to form a `Predicate` before filtering ExerHealth's database and the user's tracked exercises.

<<<

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a `SuggestPossible` command:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `SuggestPossible` command
image::SuggestActivityDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

In detail, when a `SuggestPossible` command is entered, the `Logic` component is responsible for parsing the inputs into a `Predicate`.
The `Predicate` is then used to instantiate a `SuggestPossible` command, and later used to filter a list of `Exercise` when the command is executed.
The interactions between the multiple objects can be captured using a sequence diagram.

<<<

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow when a user enters a valid `SuggestPossible` command:

.Sequence diagram of a `SuggestPossibleCommand`.
image::SuggestSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

From the sequence diagram:

1. When the `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method of `ExerciseBookParser`.

2. `ExerciseBookParser` will receive `suggest` as the command type and instantiate `SuggestCommandParser` to further parse the command.

3. `SuggestCommandParser` will receive `s/possible` as the suggest type and calls the `parsePredicate` method of `ParserUtil`
to parse the user input to create an `ExercisePredicate` object (named `p` in the diagram).

4. `SuggestCommandParser` will instantiate `SuggestPossibleCommand` with the `ExercisePredicate` as the constructor parameter.

5. The `SuggestPossibleCommand` object is then returned to `SuggestCommandParser`, followed by `ExerciseBookParser`, and lastly back to `LogicManager` to execute.

6. `LogicManager` will proceed to `execute` `SuggestPossibleCommand`.

7. `SuggestPossibleCommand` then calls the `updateSuggestedExerciseList` method in `ModelManager`, passing in the predicate to filter the list of suggest exercises.

8. `SuggestPossibleCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` to be returned.

<<<

In step 3, the process in which the `ExercisePredicate` object is created can be explored deeper.

.Sequence diagram of how an `ExercisePredicate` is created

image::SuggestPredicateSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

From the sequence diagram above:

1. `ParserUtil` creates `ExerciseMusclePredicate` and `ExerciseCustomPropertyPredicate` with the input parameters.

2. Since there were no CustomProperty tags to filter, `ParserUtil` creates `ExercisePredicate` with only the `musclesPredicate` and the boolean `isStrict`.

3. The resulting `ExercisePredicate` is then returned to `ParserUtil`, followed by `SuggestCommandParser`.

The diagram below shows the structure of a `ExercisePredicate` object.
A `ExercisePredicate` contains a `list` of `BasePropertyPredicate`,
where each contains a `Collection` of `Muscle` or `CustomProperty`.

.Class diagram of the classes behind the suggest possible feature

image::SuggestCommandClassDiagram.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

Creating classes such as `ExerciseCustomPropertyPredicate` and `ExerciseMusclePredicate`
allows us to conduct better testing because we can compare the `Collection` of `Muscle`/`CustomProperty` that is being considered.

<<<

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of predicate creation
* **Choice 1: ** `SuggestPossibleCommand` to handle the predicates.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement and understand. The class `SuggestPossibleCommand` contains the parsing and creation of the predicate
all in one place as it stores the tags, and creates the predicate and filters the list of exercises.
** Cons:
*** Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as `SuggestPossibleCommand` updates the model and creates the predicate.
* **Choice 2 (current choice): ** Predicate class to handle all predicates.
** Pros:
*** Adheres to SRP and Separation of Concern (SoC).
** Cons:
*** Increases the complexity of the code as more classes are needed, and also increases the lines of code written.

=== Statistics

==== Implementation
Statistics of exercises will be displayed in charts. Supported chart types are Pie Chart, Line Chart and Bar Chart.
StatsFactory will create Statistic using given parameters.
The figure below shows the class diagram of statistics:

Step 1: User enters a `stats` command to see statistics of exercises.

Step 2: `ExerciseBookParser` will receive command from `LogicManager` and pass command to `StatsCommandParser`.

Step 3: `StatsCommandParse` will parse the command and creates a `StatsCommand`.

Step 4: `StatsCommand` calls `Model#getExerciseBookData` to get data of all exercises.

Step 5: `StatsCommand` creates a `StatsFactory` and pass exercises data, chart and category to `StatsFactory`.

Step 6: `StatsFactory` will then generate `Statistic` and return to `StatsCommand`.

Step 7: `StatsCommand` then calls `Model#setStatistic` to set the `Statistic` in `Model`.

Step 8: `StatsCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` and return to `LogicManager`.

Shown below is the sequence diagram when user enters a valid `stats` command:

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
