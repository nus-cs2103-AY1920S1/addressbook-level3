== Introduction

This project portfolio has been written to elaborate on my
contributions to a team-based software engineering project in the NUS Computing
module CS2103T.In this module, my team of five was tasked to create an application, with reference to
the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book - Level 3].

=== Constraints
We had the the following constraints:

*Target Consumer:*::
The product should be targeting users who can type fast and prefer typing over other means of input.

Solution::
For this constraint, we ensured that the majority of the user's interactions with the application are through
the https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3337/command-line-interface-cli[_Command Line Interface (CLI)_], which implies that
users have to type commands and instructions, instead of using a Graphical User Interface(GUI).


*Application requirements:*

. The product has to be https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24409/brownfield[_Brownfield_].

.. This means that we had to
[.underline]#morph# the existing https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book] into another application.
However, we were allowed to transform the concept of the application by incrementally changing the code.



=== Product - TravEzy

Keeping the above constraints in mind, we created *TravEzy*, a desktop-based CLI travel application.
Our application [.underline]#erases# the logistical nightmare that haunts regular travellers.
We have combined critical travel applications such as
calendars, itinerary planners, diaries and budgeting tools into one convenient
and intuitive application.

=== Overview

I took up the responsibility of implementing the _Diary Feature_ , end to end, in TravEzy. While this was my main task, I also
worked on the common code base and design. In addition, I provided structure and content for critical documentation such as the User and
Developer guides.

In the following sections, I have provided more insight into my contributions.

In order to increase readability, I have included a legend of the formatting and symbols used in this portfolio.

IMPORTANT: This symbol is to highlight important information

``command``: Text which is contained in a grey box (as can be seen on the left) refers to _commands_ that the user
can type into the command line in order to interact with TravEzy

_Components_: Text which is italicised refers to technical components in the application

*Highlight* Bold text is mainly for titles

[underline]#attention# Underlined text is used to highlight certain key words and phrases




== Summary of contributions

My contributions, summarised below, have been ordered with respect to the importance and impact on the project.

*Major enhancement:*::
*Diary Feature*
* What is this:
** The Diary Feature represents a real-life diary. In this implementation, every user has a _Diary Book_ which contains a list (in the form of a _Diary List_) of all
his/her _Diary Entries_.
* Why is this necessary:
** As part of our market validation process, we observed that most student travellers enjoy journaling and recording their trips in a text format.
This feature allows for users to do exactly that, with the some additional features to increase convenience and usability.
* Highlights:
** Other than being able to do add, delete and display diary entries, this implementation of the diary feature also allows users to find specific
entries, sort through entries and encrypt private memories to keep them safe.

*Minor enhancement:*::
*Delay Function*
* Added a delay function which allows users to see an exit message when leaving the application

== Contributions to the User Guide



In this section, I shall be sharing some of the portions from the *TravEzy* Userguide which I wrote.
I shall be focusing on the ``find``, ``findSpecific`` and ``encrypt`` commands.

=== Find a Diary Entry which include a certain word inside: ``find``

"Hey, when did I go to Spain?" It can be hard to remember
all the details of your trips. That's why, this Diary allows you to *Find*

*Find entries containing a certain text: ``find``*

Finds all entries which contain your input text. There is one parameter, which
is the text that you want to find.

The _Command Word_ is ``find``.

Format: ``list input``

Example: I want to look at an old entry, it had something to do with "Aruba"...



The user enters the command ``find Aruba``

And gets a list of all _Diary Entries_ which match the command:

=== Find a Diary Entry by narrowing down your search `FindSpecific`

Let's narrow down your search!


*Find entries containing a certain text in a specific field : ``findSpecific``*

Finds all entries which contain your input text, in the highlighted field. There is one parameter, which
is the text that you want to find, with the relevant _PREFIX_.

The _Command Word_ is ``findSpecific``.

Format: ``list input``

Example: I remember that i titled the trip "Temp", but I cant remember where I went on those trips...

The user enters the command ``find Temp``

image::DiaryFindSpecificCommand.png[]

And gets a list of all _Diary Entries_ which match the command:

IMPORTANT: The ``find`` and `findSpecific` commands can't be used for empty parameters!

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

=== Diary


==== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram for Diary Feature
image::DiaryArchitecture.png[]

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design and implementation of the Diary Feature within TravEzy.


`Diary Model` has multiple classes which form the basis of a Diary.
This implementation starts at the root object, which is a `DiaryEntry`. These entries
are stored within a `DiaryList`, which are then encapsulated within a `DiaryBook`

After receiving user input from `DiaryUi`, `DiaryParser`
changes the input to a executable format, and `DiaryCommand` allows for execution of the user input.



==== UI component

.Structure of DiaryUi
image::DiaryUI.png[]

`DiaryUI`, which is represented above, consists of  `DiaryPage`, which encapsulates all the smaller Ui components.

*The main components are the:*

* `CommandBox` -> Captures user input

* `ResultDisplay` -> Returns the output after the user input has passed through the DiaryCommand

* `DiaryListPanel` -> Shows an easily readable version of the current DiaryBook

All of these components inherit from the abstract `UiPart` Class
