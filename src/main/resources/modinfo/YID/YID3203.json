    "description": "In the era of climate change, many scholars contend that we must develop alternatives to neoliberal fossil-fuelled capitalism. This course explores visions of ecotopian futures that might guide our imaginations, beliefs, and actions by examining the ways that various authors, artists, thinkers, and communities have depicted alternative \u2018green\u2019 worlds, challenging dominant ideas about human nature, gender, nonhuman nature, culture, society, politics, and the future. With a diverse range of texts, from Bj\u00f6rk and Hayao Miyazaki to Kim Stanley Robinson and Ursula K. Le Guin, we pair literature, film, music, art, and architecture with scholarship from environmental studies, history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.",
