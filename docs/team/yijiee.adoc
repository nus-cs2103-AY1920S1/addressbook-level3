=== About the project

Our team of 5 members were tasked to either enhance or morph an existing command line
interface desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project. We chose
to morph the original application into a group scheduling application called TimeBook.
TimeBook aims to help busy NUS undergraduates keep track of the schedules of the user and his or her friends, and
aid the user to arrange meetings with his or her friends.

This is a screenshot of our application.

Figure 1. GUI for TimeBook

My role was to design and write codes to display the combined schedules of NUS undergraduates from a group in the GUI
elegantly and intuitively. In the following sections, my contribution and the relevant documentations that I have made
will be elaborated in more detail.

Note the common symbols and formatting used in this document.

.  `show` -- Monospaced uncapitalised word indicates that this is a command that can be executed in the command line.
. `ScheduleView` -- Monospace capitalised indicates that this is a class or component in TimeBook.


==== Overview of contributions
This section provides an overview of the code, documentation and administrative contributions to the team project

* *Code contributed*: Please take a look https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=yijie&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=YiJiee&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[here] to see the codes that I have contributed.

===== Main feature added: The schedule graphic of multiple schedules in TimeBook.

* What: Enables users to see a 7-day schedule graphic in the form of a time table in TimeBook. The `show` and `export` command does this.
* Justification: This is the key feature of TimeBook as it directly addresses the problem of having to tediously cross reference every separate schedule in order to identify free time slots for group meetings.
* Highlights: This feature that I have implemented fits well with the other features that my teammates developed. For example, one of my teammates developed
an NUSMods parser that makes use of parsing NUSMods links into data that is then displayed using my feature. Implementing this feature is not easy as I had to first create an empty time table
and figure out a way to add events (represented by blocks) into this empty time table without distorting the other contents in the time table. In addition, I had to design the graphic
such that resizing the application or adjusting the screen resolution will not distort the time table. Finally, I had to test my feature using TestFX to make sure that the graphic rendered is correct.
* Credits: TestFX for providing a framework for automated GUI testing.

====== Additional features that enhances the schedule graphic shown in TimeBook.

* Toggle the schedule graphic to show the graphics for subsequent week's schedule. This is done through the `togglenext` command.
** Enhanced usability of our application.
* Look at only schedules belonging to some members of a group. This is done through the `lookat` command.
** Implemented in order for users to filter and inspect the schedules of some group members in a particular group.

Other contributions:

* Application
** Developed GUI color scheme and UI layout such as schedule window display, tabs panel and default home
page to make significant cosmetic improvement to the application. {repoURL}/pull/86[#86] {repoURL}/pull/93[#93] {repoURL}/pull/125[#125] {repoURL}/pull/254[#254]
** Wrote test cases for the application itself and its GUI that increased coverage by about 5%. {repoURL}/pull/263[#263] {repoURL}/pull/268[#268] {repoURL}/pull/274[#274]
* Community
** Helped to develop non-trivial UI components for my team members. {repoURL}/pull/237[#237]
* Documentation
** Made user guide and developer guide more reader-friendly.
* Tools
** Set up TestFX for GUI Testing. {repoURL}/pull/206[#206]
** Created a google spreadsheet for the team to share bugs the they have found.

==== Contributions to User Guide
Our team had to override the original addressbook documentation with the instructions for TimeBook. This section shows my contributions
to the User Guide and my ability to convey instructions for the application to target users.
