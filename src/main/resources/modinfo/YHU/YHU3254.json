    "description": "This course provides an in-depth examination of the city of Tokyo and the historical phase in which it transitioned from a pre-modern city called Edo, to the modern city of Tokyo that we know today. It will involve close readings and analysis of visual materials ('floating world pictures' (ukiyo-e)), historical artefacts, literature and film from the later Edo period (1800s) to the modern era to provide an understanding of Japanese culture and history that has conditioned its transformation into one of the major global cities in Asia today. This module fulfills the Art History track in the Arts & Humanities major.",
