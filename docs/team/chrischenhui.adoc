== image:address_book_32.png[icon, 39, 36] Overview of _Dukemon_
//== Overview of _Dukemon_

._Dukemon_'s design.
image::DukemonWithMewOnly.png[width="400"]

_Dukemon_ is a desktop flashcard application, which aims to streamline and gamify
the process of learning words and definitions. +
The user interacts with it primarily through a CLI (Command Line Interface), with some GUI (Graphical User Interface) features.

Allow me to brief you on some useful terms and to give you a context.

1. Flashcards are termed as `Cards`. +
2. A collective set of `Cards` are termed as `WordBank`.

3. A general flow of _Dukemon_'s usage is as follows:

.. Note taking phase

... User creates/selects a `WordBank`.
... User populates the `WordBank` with `Cards`, or edit the `Cards`.

.. Learning phase

... User starts the game using selected `WordBank`.
... _Dukemon_ prompts the questions, and user has to answer accordingly.
... _Dukemon_ ends the game.
... User reviews performance from statistics page.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major feature
*_WordBank_ Management*

* *What it does:* +
** Enables user to have a high level management for his _WordBanks_ and _Cards_ through CLI and GUI. +
Is semi-automated by _Dukemon_ to enhance user's learning experience. +
Consists of four complementary distinct sections.

. *_WordBank_'s data structure and its storage system*: +
Allows developers to use and extend this architecture to streamline their feature implementation. +
Allows user to save and load their _WordBanks_. +
Is implemented with a robust underlying `WordBankList` data structure, with its
own `WordBankListStorage`,
along with rich integration of `Model`, `Storage`, `Logic` and `UI` to synchronise its
data.

. *User Commands*: +
Allows user to customise _Cards_ / _WordBanks_ through `CardCommands` / `WordBankCommands`.

. *Drag and drop*: +
Allows user to export their _WordBanks_ out of their computer simply by dragging it out of _Dukemon_. +
Likewise, it allows user to import a _WordBank_ file from their computer by dragging it into _Dukemon_.

. *Revision _WordBank_*: +
Allows user to visit a centralised word bank that automatically collects cards for revision. +
Cards that were answered wrongly are automatically added to this revision bank. +
Likewise, cards that were answered correctly during game play are automatically removed from this revision bank.

//{nbsp}

* *Justification:*

** Well designed architecture and well implemented data structure streamlines integration and allows extension for
features that builds on top of it. (_Statistics, Game, Settings_)

** Management system is essential for a self-typed flashcard app like _Dukemon_.

** Drag and drop accelerates the sharing of knowledge/notes with friends, thereby enhancing user experience. +

** Revision _WordBank_ improves the learning process by helping the user collate cards that requires revision.

//{nbsp}

* *Highlights:*

** There exists multiple ways to design and implement _WordBank_ management. Throughout _Dukemon_'s development,
it has been restructured and rewritten a few times before finally coming to how it is implemented now. +
This was primarily because my teammate's features requires heavy and continuous integration with _WordBank's_ management. We came together twice every week to discuss how our features should be integrated with one another. +
To best implement it, I spent considerable amount of effort to study different design patterns and architectural styles, such as _MVC (Model View Controller)_,
_Observer Pattern_, _n-Tier Style_, _Event-Driven Style_, to realise the final design.

** Continual in-depth discussion with team member, Subbash, to find the best design to integrate user commands
with his different modes.

** Discussed with team member, Paul, who is in-charge of UI, on _Observer Pattern_ usage to display _Cards_ and _WordBanks_ that automatically
update itself.

** Consulted team member, Jason, on how I can best leverage his _Statistics_ feature to streamline my revision bank implementation.

** Learned and adapted _Callbacks_ and _Functional Programming_ into my drag and drop section
to preserve the quality and structural integrity of the existing code base, from team member Yi Da.

** Individually sourced for proper online tutorials and online code references to implement drag and drop section,
and design concepts such as _Observer Pattern_ and _MVC_ within _Cards_ and _WordBanks_.

Likewise, drag and drop a _WordBank_ out of the application, into say,
your desktop, or chat applications. +

Try it!

NOTE: _Dukemon_ only accepts json files when importing _WordBanks_. Attempting to
import or export other types files will not be successful.

=== Revision _WordBank_

A revision bank is automatically updated for you, every time a game session ends. +
It collates all your wrong _cards_, whichever _WordBank_ it may have came from. +
It is also smart enough to remove the _cards_ if you have cleared it afterwards.

//.Revision bank alongside with other word banks.

.Quick look at revision bank's page.

The revision bank is best appreciated when you actually play around with some _WordBanks_, and then visit the revision bank
to revise wrong _cards_. Give it a try!

=== _WordBank_'s data structure and its storage

//include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=chenhui-wblStorageModel]

===== _WordBank_'s storage system integration.

.Integration of `WordBankList` within `Storage` and `Model`.
image::WBStorage.png[]

`WordBankListStorage` consists of robust methods in which developers can use and extend upon easily. +
Alongside with _WordBank_'s data structure, they lay the foundation for the other complementary sections of _WordBank_ Management.

On top of that, they serve as a essential foundation for Dukemon. As such, these data structures and methods were required
by the team, to build individual features. (_Statistics_, _Game_, _Settings_)

=== User commands

//include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=chenhui-wblLogicStorageModel]

Allows user to customise _Cards_ and group them according to topics (_WordBanks_). +
User commands edits and manipulates _Cards_ and _WordBanks_ heavily.

NOTE: As mentioned previously, user commands will extend and utilise _WordBank_'s data structure and storage heavily. +
You can refer to it to enhance your understanding of this implementation.

//A `WordBankList` contains multiple `WordBanks`.

//Each time a `CardCommand` or `WordBankCommand` is executed, `Storage` data is synchronised and
//`Model` gets updated automatically for `UI` to retrieve updated information for user viewing.

//A card command edits the cards within a particular word bank. Therefore it needs to make function calls through the
//WordBank data structure. +
//A word bank command edits the word bank within that particular word bank list. Therefore it needs to make function calls through
//the WordBankList data structure.

Let us first introduce you how these commands are implemented and structured in `Logic`. +

// end::chenhui-dragAndDropSequenceDiagram[]


`LoadBankPanel` is the corresponding class and the FXML file that displays the _WordBanks_ for the user. +
It is deeply nested within `UI` and only has access to an `ObservableList<WordBank>`. +
This means it has no way to perform `commands`, update `model` or update `storage`.

1. To work around this, a functional callback is registered within `LoadBankPanel`.
2. `LoadBankPanel` registers JavaFX's UI drag detection and drag dropped methods, with the _callback_. +
3. After which, the _callback_ essentially performs an `ImportCommand`, to load the _WordBank_.

It is also noteworthy to mention that, dragging into Dukemon functionality is well guarded against: +

* Not json file format.
* Json file but data in wrong format.
* Json file with correct format but contains duplicate _cards_ within.

User receives apt feedback through the command box for different cases.
This is possible with careful exceptions handling within the `ImportCommand` itself.
