    "description": "This seminar will introduce the physical parts and the social meanings of medieval books. We will focus mainly on late-medieval English manuscripts, making use of the extensive digital surrogates available online. Technical topics to be considered include the making of parchment, the sewing of quires, the construction of bindings, and the layout of the page. More interpretative challenges will include learning to read medieval scripts (paleography), and analyzing that ways in which many varieties of decoration help to construct meaning. Includes an exploration of intersections between medieval manuscript culture and contemporary digital cultures.",
