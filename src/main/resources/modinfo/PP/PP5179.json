    "description": "Clean air and water affect human welfare in many direct and indirect ways. However, an almost inadvertent outcome of societal aspirations and economic progress is polluted air and water. This trade-off is faced by every policymaker and this module draws on knowledge from environmental sciences, epidemiology, public health, environmental and development economics, public economics, and others fields to characterize this problem and study possible policy responses. Given the interdisciplinary nature of this topic, this is also a gateway class to more advanced learnings in environmental economics, cost-benefit analysis, program and impact evaluation.",
