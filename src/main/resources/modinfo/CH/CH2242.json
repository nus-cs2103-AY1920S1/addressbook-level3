    "description": "The module investigates the complex historical processes through which a 'Chinese' identity is constructed and contested, both within and without China, from the late nineteenth century to the present. Special attention will be paid to delineating how global flows of peoples, capitals and cultures influenced the ways Chinese communities in various parts of the world defined themselves against others and how that has changed over time and across space. The course is intended for students who are interested in identity politics in general and the 'Chinese identity question' in particular. Field learning is an integral component of the course.",
