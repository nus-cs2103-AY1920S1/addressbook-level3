== Project: DukeCooks image:DukeCooks_Logo.png[align="center", width="50"]

== What is DukeCooks?

DukeCooks is a lifestyle desktop application, specially designed for busy, health-conscious individuals.
As busy student project developers for DukeCooks, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various
tasks and yet, manage a healthy lifestyle at the same time.

DukeCooks aims to simplify this by allowing you to manage various aspects of your lifestyle, all within a single app!
In DukeCooks, you will be able to manage tasks, store recipes, plan workouts, monitor health and write diaries.

Not only that, DukeCooks runs on the command-line interface (CLI). This means that all the tasks mentioned above can be
executed all within a single line, saving you even more time!

== Who developed DukeCooks?

DukeCooks is developed by a group of Year 2 students from: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

== Contributions to Overall Project

=== Building the diary feature

The diary feature provide users with the ability to share their fitness and health tips. Furthermore, it allows users to
view diaries in a simple and intuitive manner. The initial works for building the diary feature includes heavy referencing from the existing
Address Book 3 (AB3) codebase.

=== *Major Enhancements*

==== Enhancement 1: Creating the `ViewDiaryCommand`

The `ViewDiaryCommand` is created to allow users to switch views between different diaries

This is specially designed so that users can switch diary views, without having to rely on clicking the mouse.

The functionality of `ViewDiaryCommand` is quite similar to that of `ListCommand` in AB3. I have modified the `ListCommand`
in AB3 to allow the user to provide an diary index and only display that corresponding diary.

==== Enhancement 2: Creating the `AddPageCommand` Page Input Form

If `AddPageCommand` is executed, it opens a Page Input Form for users to enter their page details.

As a page's details can get quite lengthy, the Page Input Form is created to help users by providing a GUI
interface that is more suited for lengthy inputs.

This enhancement required heavy works in terms of GUI and I had to ensure that the inputs provided in the Page Input Form
are first validated before it can be executed as a command.

=== *Minor Enhancements*

==== Enhancement: Adding icons and colours to pages

I have added different icons and colours to represent a page's type.
By differentiating the pages through colours and icons, users are able to quickly identify the
3 different page types: health, exercise and food with one glance.
