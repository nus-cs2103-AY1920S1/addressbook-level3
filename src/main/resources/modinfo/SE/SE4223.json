    "description": "Students of history usually mine Western accounts of Southeast Asia for the facts that they may contain, assuming that such texts are simply a means of accessing a vaguely apprehended reality \"out there\". This module examines the ways in which writers located themselves vis a vis the region; the kinds of images, themes and motifs they used to describe it; the ideas and doctrines that informed them; the institutions and other works they affiliated their writings with; and the power over the societies of the region that arose from their enterprise. Modern scholarship has largely inherited Orientalist ways of looking at Southeast Asia. What are the alternatives?",
