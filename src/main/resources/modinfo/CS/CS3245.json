    "description": "This module discusses the basic concepts and methods of information retrieval including capturing, representing, storing, organizing, and retrieving unstructured or loosely structured information. The most well-known aspect of information retrieval is document retrieval: the process of indexing and retrieving text documents. However, the field of information retrieval includes almost any type of unstructured or semi-structured data, including newswire stories, transcribed speech, email, blogs, images, or video. Therefore, information retrieval is a critical aspect of Web search engines. This module also serves as the foundation for subsequent modules on the understanding, processing and retrieval of particular web media.",
