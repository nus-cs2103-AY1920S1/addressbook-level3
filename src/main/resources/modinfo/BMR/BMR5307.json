    "description": "The objective of this module is to impart a rigorous and in-depth introduction to all the key aspects of FinTech. Technological change is disrupting many aspects of the financial industry, with (by some estimates) close to 30% of traditional finance jobs at risk of elimination. However, introduction of new technology offers opportunities as well as risks. This course focuses on the business effects of technological change, rather than on the technological change itself.",
