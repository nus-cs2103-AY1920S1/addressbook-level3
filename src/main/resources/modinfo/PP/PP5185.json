    "description": "This course equips students to engage in well-informed debates on how to power our civilisation while protecting the biosphere. The first half of the course positions energy policy within the broader context of sustainable development and, consequently, helps cultivate an understanding of the problems and prospective solutions associated with fostering a transition away from carbonintensive energy technologies. The second half of the course introduces students to the policy cycle and aims to develop applied awareness of the multi-faceted challenges that policymakers face in attempting to cobble together sustainable energy policy.",
