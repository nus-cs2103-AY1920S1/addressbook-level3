    "description": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. What factors contribute to positive life outcomes? Is successful living predicated simply by demographics or do social attitudes lead to a happy life? Are these two factors linked? We explore 40 years of data to answer questions surrounding the relationship between demographics, attitude, and the quality of life of individuals.",
