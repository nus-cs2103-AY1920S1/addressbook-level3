    "description": "This course provides a brief introduction to the modern Middle East from 1699 to the present. It covers events and trends that shaped and ended the Ottoman Empire, the rise of European imperialism, processes of social change and state-building, creation of 'new orders,' (constitutional republics, Islamic regimes or authoritarian states), the Cold War, and relations between state and society during times of local, regional, and global change. To that end, we will read a wide array of writings, including standard textbooks, academic articles, official documents, memoires, and novels.",
