    "description": "This course provides practical training in the use of digital video cameras and film editing, as a research tool in the social sciences. This knowledge will be grounded in an understanding of how ethnographic documentary film has developed as a medium, its essential stylistic features and its ethical responsibilities to the participants in a film. Students work in small groups to learn basic techniques, then make a ten-minute film on a subject of sociological relevance. The aim is to equip students to be able to use video in future field research, and to instill an understanding of the ethnographic potentials of visual media.",
