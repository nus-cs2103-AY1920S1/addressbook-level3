    "description": "Sustainability and sustainable development entered our lexicon in 1987 with the publication of the UN\u2019s Brundtland Report. This report helped clarify the connections between the environmental, economic and social spheres. The crucial relationships between these domains have been examined at both the global and local levels resulting in the UN defining 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This module offers an interdisciplinary introduction to a subset of the UN Development Goals. Our objective is to understand the challenges presented by the construct of sustainable development, generate critical understanding of this construct, and offer potential solutions supporting sustainable development.",
