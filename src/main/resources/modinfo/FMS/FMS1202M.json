    "description": "Mathematics is the best known but least understood subject. It plays a fundamental role in the development of science, technology and society but it has received little public recognition and is often misused or wrongly perceived as not useful in life. The seminar module will expose students to various views on the nature of mathematics, the enterprise called mathematics and its role in the development of science, technology and society. The module will also focus on specific topics or issues in science, technology and society where mathematics have significant impact, such the 2007 financial crisis, the internet, digital age, electronic commerce, epidemics and so forth. The topics and issues may be introduced by the lecturer or identified by the students. The students may focus on aspects of a topic that they are most interested in and at a mathematical level that they are comfortable with depending on their background. The mathematics would be elementary and mostly algorithmic and discrete in the beginning and will move gently up to a level, which may be different for different students.",
