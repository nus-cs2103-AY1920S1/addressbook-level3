    "description": "Earth Materials (Minerals) and Human Health introduces to the rapidly expanding field of Medical Geology and is concerned with the environmental and human health consequences of naturally-occurring geological materials and their spatial relations with impacted human populations. Overarching goals are to impart an understanding of Earth as the source of all materials that support and permit daily life and the chemical, physical and biological processes that shape the environment and impact human health. Topics will cover the transport and transformations of elements in rocks/soil/air/ water; their uptake and cycling by microbes, plants and animals; and changes generated through human activities.",
