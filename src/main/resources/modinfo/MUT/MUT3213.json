    "description": "This module begins with an overview of Beethoven\u2019s music and his influence on contemporaneous and later 19th century composers. The heart of this course explores the divide between absolute and programme music. \u2018Leipzigerisch\u2019 composers (Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms) versus the \u2018New German School\u2019 (Berlioz, Liszt). Nationalism is included. The final weeks are devoted to the Opera genre by examining the works of Wagner, Verdi and Puccini. It extends to Strauss and Mahler, who represent the final flowering of musical Romanticism. With the model of a Romantic composer/performer, Romantic Styles is designed to bridge compositional work with performance, supported by interpretative analysis.",
