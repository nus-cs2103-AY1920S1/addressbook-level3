    "description": "This module examines the tension between \u2018need\u2019 to \u2018develop\u2019 and imperatives of conserving natural resources in the backdrop of enormous socio-economic and environmental challenges we face today. Sustainable development (SD) emerged as a response to confront these challenges; whether it has served its purpose or not remains debatable. Different scientific, technological, economic and political instruments encompassing sustainable development (SD) will be critically evaluated. The criticality of natural resources and their consumption patterns will be presented to the students. The need to engage local communities in new ways in social construction of SD would be discussed.",
