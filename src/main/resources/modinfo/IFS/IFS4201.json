Students will also sharpen communication skills through close team interactions, consultations, and formal presentations. Students will be jointly guided by supervisors from both the companies/organisations and the school. Their progress will be monitored during the internship period, and their performance will be assessed through letter grades at the end of internship. The project duration is expected to be approximately 16 weeks (full-time).",
