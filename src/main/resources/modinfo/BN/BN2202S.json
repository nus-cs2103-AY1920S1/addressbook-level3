    "description": "This module will present fundamental transport solutions which model the major features of biological flow. The conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a system will be studied and applied to blood flows in the cardiovascular system. Basic knowledge of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics will also be covered. Bifurcation flow and Hemorheology in macrocirculation and microcirculation will be discussed. Basic mass transfer will be introduced to the students.",
