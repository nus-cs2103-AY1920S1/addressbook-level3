    "description": "Risk taking lies at the heart of business and the economy. Biology, psychology, and economics are converging today into a unified discipline which can deliver a revolutionary approach to understanding how people take risk, to realize greater returns or for recreation. We shall begin with discussing economic models of risk taking incorporating psychological considerations and how they are tested in choice experiments. Beyond economic outcomes and psychological factors, evidence points to the role of biology, through genes, hormones, and neurochemicals, in modulating risk taking observed in the laboratory and in the field with important ramifications for the real world.",
