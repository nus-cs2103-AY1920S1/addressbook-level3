    "description": "Independent research plays an important role in graduate education. The Independent Study Module is designed to enable the student to explore an approved topic in Malay Studies in depth. The student should approach a lecturer to work out an agreed upon topic, readings and assignments for the module. A formal written agreement is to be drawn up, giving a clear account of the topic, number of contact hours, assignments, evaluation, and other relevant details. The Head\u2019s and/or Graduate Coordinator\u2019s approval is required. Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and lecturer prior to seeking departmental approval.",
