== Introduction
This portfolio serves to showcase my contributions to our team project THRIFT. The project was part of
the requirements of a year two software engineering module, CS2103T, that I had taken as an undergraduate in NUS.

=== About THRIFT
THRIFT is an application for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their incomes and expenditures so that they can make informed financial decisions. THRIFT is designed for those who prefer to work quickly with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 This is how the user interface of THRIFT looks like:

THRIFT is a fork of the original https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook-Level3] application which allows users to create a personalised list of contacts.
My team and I have since transformed the application to suit our use cases.

=== About the THRIFT Team
The THRIFT Team consists of five passionate developers and I was the Software Architect, who is in charge of documentation.
The other team members and their respective roles were:

* Poh Jia Hao (Team Lead)
* Lee Bo Qiang (User Experience Developer),
* Lye Jian Wen (Quality Assurance Manager)
* Kenson Oen (Process Analyst).

Every single member played an important and major role in ensuring the success of THRIFT.

=== About this document

In this document, I will use some special text styling as described below to help you understand the document better.

NOTE: This symbol denotes information you might want to note of.

[horizontal]
`currencyMappings`:: Text with grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that it is a method/variable name or a command.

`**ModelManager**`:: Bold text within a mark-up indicates a class/package name.

== Summary of Contributions
This section provides a summary of the various contributions I have made to THRIFT.

=== Functionality enhanced

The following are some of my enhancements:

* **Major enhancement:** Added the **ability to tag and un-tag** entries in the transaction list.
** What it does: The `tag` and `untag` commands allow the user to tag and un-tag their transactions.
** Justification: It allows users to add and remove specific tags from transactions.
** Highlights: The original AB3 edit function replaces the entire set of tags related to a transaction entry.
My `tag` command adds to the set instead of overwriting it, with duplicate tags being detected and ignored.
My `untag` command removes specified tags from the set instead of overwriting it, with the user being warned for trying to delete non-existent tags.

* **Major enhancement:** Added the **ability to convert currency**.
** What it does: The `convert` command allows the user to convert currency from one to another within the application.
** Justification: It is possible that user wants to travel overseas or simply purchase something in another currency, they would then want an estimate of the exchange rates they can get.
** Highlights: The `convert` command has the ability to use exchange rates stored in a JSON file, which can be obtained by downloading and modifying the JSON output from free online exchange rate services to obtain the latest rates.
** Credits: The sample rates were obtained from the https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html[European Central Bank].

* **Minor enhancements:** Modified the THRIFT interface to **display tags in different colours**.
** Justification: Tags in THRIFT are meant to categorise the different transactions, it is more meaningful if tags are of different colour if they correspond to different categories.
** Highlights: The colours are coloured into different colours if they are a <<../UserGuide#TagColours, keyword>>, otherwise they are in Purple.
