== Introduction

Athletick is a team management desktop application for captains and coaches of timing-based sports teams. Athletick helps you to handle your administrative tasks so that you can focus on what you love doing: leading and motivating your team.

Athletick supports *storing of your team members' personal details, attendance tracking and performance recording*. If you are a fast typist, you'll love Athletick's *Command Line Interface* (CLI) which will get your team management tasks done faster than ever before!

This command find athletes whose name contains any of the keywords you provide.

[NOTE]
====

This command will change your athletes’ `INDEX`.

This command is case-insensitive, so finding by `Joseph` and `joseph` will give the same result.

Only full keyword matches are accepted (eg. to find `Joseph Schooling`, you need to search
for `Joseph` or `Schooling`, but *not `Jo`*.

====

Let's say that you want to find Joseph Schooling from your long list of athletes.

*What you should do*

Type in the command in the following format and press `Enter` to execute it.

Format : `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Example : `find joseph`

number of athletes whose names have the keyword(s) you provided, as shown in the red box in the diagram
below.

Additionally, the athlete list (orange box) will show only the athletes whose names have the keyword(s) you
provided.

.Note that the index numbers of the athletes in the searched list may differ from that of the unsearched list. Refer to the diagram below for an explanation.

The diagram below shows the change in the active list (from unsearched to searched) when the search term is

//tag::undoredo[]

==== Undoing a previous command : `undo`

This command restores Athletick to the state before the previous command was executed.

[NOTE]
====
Take note that the `undo` feature only applies to undoable commands.
Undoable commands include: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `training`, `event` and `performance`.

The `undo` command will not be able to undo non-undoable commands.
Let’s say you have executed a `list` command to list out all the athletes information in Athletick.
If you were to execute the `undo` command now, the `undo` command will fail because `list` is not an undoable command,
and that no undoable commands were executed before this.

The `undo` command will reverse the latest command that can be undone.
Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command, followed by the `list` command.
Since `list` command is not an undoable command, if you were to execute `undo`
command now, you will thus reverse the `delete` command.

The `undo` command reverses previous commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say you have executed the `edit` command, followed by the `delete` command. If you were
to execute `undo` command now, you will reverse the `delete` command. Executing `undo` again
will then reverse the `edit` command.
====

Let’s say you have accidentally deleted an athlete’s contact (Mohamad Ali) from your list.
Instead of having to re-enter Mohamad Ali’s contact information all over again,
you can easily restore all of Mohamad Ali’s details by executing the command `undo` to
undo the `delete` command that you have just entered.

*What you should do*

With Mohamad Ali's contact information deleted, the current list has 7 people. Type `undo` into the command box, and
press Enter to execute it.

Format : `undo`

image::Undo0.png[width="400"]

*What you should see*

The result box will display a success message and you can check that
Mohamad Ali’s contact information is visible in the list again!

image::AfterUndo0.png[width="400"]

==== Redoing an `undo` command : `redo`

This command reverses the most recent `undo` command.

[NOTE]
====
The `redo` command can only be executed immediately after an `undo` command.
Let’s say that you have executed the `undo` command to undo a previous command that you have previously executed.
You then execute the `list` command to view your list.
Executing the `redo` command now will fail because your previous command was not an `undo` command.

The `redo` command reverses previous `undo` commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say that you have executed the `clear` command, followed by the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command now will reverse the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command again will reverse the `clear` command as well.
Following this, executing the `redo` command will reverse the most recent `undo` command and re-execute the `clear`
command.
Executing the `redo` command again will reverse the second most recent `undo` command and re-execute the `add` command.
====

Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command to delete Mohamad Ali from your list.
You may undo this action and restore Mohamad Ali’s information by executing the `undo` command.



Then, if you decide that you want the contact to remain deleted after all,
you may very quickly do so by executing the `redo` command to reverse the `undo` command that you had just executed.

*What you should do*

With Mohamad Ali's contact information, the current list has 8 people. Type `redo` into the command box, and press
Enter to execute it.

Format : `redo`

image::Redo0.png[width="400"]
*What you should see*

The result box will display a success message.
Furthermore, the list now only has 7 people and Mohamad Ali is once deleted from the list!
