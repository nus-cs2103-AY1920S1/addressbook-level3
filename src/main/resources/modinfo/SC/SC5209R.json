    "description": "This module provides sociological ways of looking at a multitude of patterns of everyday life, ranging from talking, touching, feeling, using space, waiting, relating to members of the opposite sex, choosing clothing, to presenting images of oneself to others. A large part of the module will focus on everyday life through the understanding of processes of interaction, as well as the mutually transformative connections between social structures and everyday face-to-face encounters. Using existing sociological frameworks and case studies, it analyses the form and character of everyday life experiences of Singaporeans.",
