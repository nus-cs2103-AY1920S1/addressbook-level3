    "description": "Exploring a transformative period in European history, this module will immerse students in the vicissitudes of the turbulent Weimar Republic (1918-1933) through the lens of Berlin\u2019s roaring twenties and with particular reference to the life and work of Magnus Hirschfeld, a Jewish physician who was the face of scientifically enlightened sexual reformism, who travelled the globe as the \u2018Einstein of Sex\u2019 and who became a prime target of Nazi oppression as the Weimar Republic collapsed in the early 1930s. Weimar Berlin offers an illuminating window onto Europe\u2019s ambivalences regarding democracy, liberalism, modernity, social and sexual change in the 20th century.",
