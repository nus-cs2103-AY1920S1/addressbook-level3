    "description": "This is essentially a module designed to encourage students to apply different fieldwork methods in small-team projects in an overseas context within the region. The module exposes students to different geographical methods, both human and physical, and as such it is an ideal preparation for any student wishing to undertake further primary research at higher levels in geography, and indeed other social science disciplines. After a series of lectures/seminars on fieldwork methods, fieldwork ethics, and health and safety issues in the field (which may include some basic introductory language classes), students then undertake a 2-5 week period of field study overseas, depending on logistical and other constraints. The previous field studies have been for periods of 4-5 weeks overseas in Thailand and Malaysia. Whilst overseas, students undergo orientation workshops, meet peers in host universities, visit potential field sites before conducting an intensive period of fieldwork in small groups of 3-5 students. The module concludes with (group and individual) project report writing and presentations. Field Studies provides basic training, a chance to apply skills and techniques learnt in the classroom in real field settings, and rich opportunities for cultural exchanges.",
