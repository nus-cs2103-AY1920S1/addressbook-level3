    "description": "This is a course in macro-sociology. The module reviews the interdisciplinary literature on modernization, development and globalization in order to examine the formation and evolving dynamics of firms, regions, and markets within the global capitalist system. Ultimately, the course asks questions about Asia\u2019s place within the contemporary global economy and the role Asian political economies and industrial organization play within it. Students will learn about 'big' sociological questions regarding the transition to capitalism, global development and inequality, global trade and industry. They will understand how Asia developed and what their iPhones and Nike sneakers have to do with this.",
