    "description": "The Roman public baths are visual showpieces of architectural and technological prowess, and a sanitary haven for everyone in a disease-ridden city; they are also a meeting point for prostitutes, thieves and poisoners, as different classes of naked Romans engage in all manner of sordid encounters. This course offers an opportunity to explore the bewildering topic of the Roman public bathing experience through a series of prose texts studied in the original Latin. Selections come from architectural treatises, medicinal works, biography, and moralist letters, as well as the infamous bathhouse plot ridiculed by Cicero in his speech, Pro Caelio.",
