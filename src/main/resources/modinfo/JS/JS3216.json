    "description": "Many Japanese literary works have been adapted into films, often with new interpretations. Students will do comparative readings/viewings of these works, paying special attention to the unique characteristics of each genre, and their thematic concerns. One of the key concerns in these works is the ascription and representation of gender (often female, occasionally male) roles. Works with prominent gender themes including Abe Kobo's Women in the Dunes will be studied as a means to critically examine the gender discourse in modern Japan, as well as other pertinent issues such as alienation, identity, and history which are often part of the discursive construction of gender.",
