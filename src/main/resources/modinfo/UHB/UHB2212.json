    "description": "'Our generation,' Singaporean playwright Joel Tan remarks, 'is sick with nostalgia.' From the popularity of retro and vintage styles to the proliferation of artwork (some state-sanctioned, some not) that lovingly look to and at our past, Singapore seems to be in the firm grip of nostalgia. Are these indeed manifestations of nostalgia? Is any interest in the past nostalgic, or does nostalgia consists of a style or a way of regarding the past? More importantly, how should we understand these nostalgic tendencies? In what senses is nostalgia a 'sickness,' and can Singaporean practices of nostalgia help us rethink this characterization?
