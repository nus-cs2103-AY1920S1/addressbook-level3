== PROJECT: Teacher's Notebook

---

== Overview

Teacher's Notebook is a desktop application designed for teachers to manage their busy schedules, by aiding the the tasks of
 managing classrooms, students, and assignments. There is also a reminder function to alert the user to upcoming lessons.
 The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage classrooms with the Notebook class*
** What it does: Allows the user to group students and assignments within classrooms, and reminders
outside of classrooms.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have more than one classroom of students, and
have different assignments for each classroom. Reminders are also not specific to a classroom,
and hence should not reside within the classroom class.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis
 of existing structure and relations between existing classes. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes
 to the entire structure of the application, from logic and commands to storage.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added color to indicate selection of classrooms
