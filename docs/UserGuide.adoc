== Introduction

A powerlifting competition/meet consists of 3 lifts, the Squat, Bench and Deadlift. With 3 attempts, athletes will try to outdo and challenge themselves and lift as heavy as they can.

This software is for organisers who organise powerlifting competitions. To facilitate the ease of data-entry, we have provided a command line interface that is augmented with a Graphical User Interface to help them better administer powerlifting competitions.

== Powerlifting Background: Read this if you are new to powerlifting

=== What is Powerlifting?
Powerlifting athletes compete in 3 events: The Squat, The Deadlift and The Bench Press.
For each event, all athletes have 3 tries: they declare a weight which they want to attempt for each try.
Example: John declares the following 3 weights for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd attempt of the squat respectively: 100kg, 150kg, 200kg.
The athletes will usually compete in the different events and perform all 3 attempts for an event in the following order:
The Squat, The Bench Press and finally, The Deadlift.

=== How are scores computed for Powerlifting?
Suppose that John declares 100kg for the 1st attempt of the squat.
If he succeeds in clearing the 1st attempt, 100kg will be considered for the overall score for the squat event.
Consequently, if John declares 200kg for the 2nd attempt of the squat and succeeds in clearing that attempt, 200kg will be considered for the overall score for the squat event.
For each event, an athlete obtains a score which is the maximum weight of the 3 attempts.
Example: Suppose John fails the 3rd attempt, the weight he has declared for that attempt will not be considered for the overall score.
So, the John's final score for the squat attempt is max(200kg, 100kg), which is 200kg.

=== How is the overall score determined for Powerlifting?
For each athlete, just sum the maximum weight obtained for each event.
Suppose John has the following results:
The maximum weight for squat: 200kg
The maximum weight for bench press: 150kg
The maximum weight for deadlift: 300kg
The total score for John: 200kg + 150kg + 300kg = 650kg

=== How are winners determined for Powerlifting?
Just find which athlete has the highest overall score.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Note that Powerlifting Coordinator has different commands for different contexts.
  There are only two contexts: During Competition (In-session) and Outside of Competition (Out-session)

success of their lifts. It will show the relevant information to prepare for the
athletes lift (displaying name, weight, etc). The flow of events, and the commands to
facilitate the competition session will be presented in order below:

The flow of events, and the commands to facilitate the competition session will be presented in order below:

==== Get the next lifter in line: `next`
Retrieves the next lifter according to weight lifted for that attempt, the weights he/she is going for that particular
lift and attempt.
If there are no more attempts to be made by any lifter, this command will trigger the end of the competition.

Format/Example: `next`

==== Updating success or failure of a lift: `lift`
Updates whether the person (athlete) succeeds in his/her attempt, or fails it.
The lift updated will be the one that was just called up.

Format: `lift Y/N`

Examples:

* `lift N`

* `lift Y`

// end::sessions[]

//tag::Rank[]

==== Getting the rank of a person (athlete) for a given competition: `rank`
Retrieves the rank of a person relative other competitors in the competition.

Format: `rank n/NAME`

Example:

* `rank n/Ho`

//end::Rank[]

==== Getting the rank of a person (athlete) for a given competition, using a specific criterion: `ranklist`
Retrieves a sorted order of all the participants of a the competition in-session based on the ranking method
stipulated in the command. This ranking methods can be broadly categorized as being either the overall score or
the maximum weight lifted for a particular exercise.
Available ranking methods are by:

1. Squat
2. Deadlift
3. Bench Press
4. Overall (overall score)
