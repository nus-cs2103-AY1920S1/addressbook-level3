    "description": "The aim of this module is to help students understand how nature works by exploring simple computer modelling and using simulation techniques. Examples from predator-prey systems, vehicular traffic, fire-fly flash synchronisation, ant colonies, earthquakes, DLA, disease spreading, and social-economic systems are used to illustrate the emergence of complexity in self-organising systems. The module will help students appreciate how computer modelling provides an algorithmic way of thinking about the science of complex systems and the complexity of their simulation.",
