    "description": "This module deals with quantum measurement theory and the interpretation of the observed statistics. It covers advanced mathematical formalism of quantum measurement; Bell\u2019s inequalities; and the quantum-to- classical transition (notably decoherence). Emphasis is put on providing both the understanding of the concepts and the ability of using the mathematical tools.",
