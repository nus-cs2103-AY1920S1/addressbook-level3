== Introduction

Teacher’s Notebook is for teachers who prefer to make use of an application to keep track of the deliverables,
tasks and students’ information. It is optimized for teachers who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a teacher who wants to manage your students and your tasks efficiently, and can type fast, Teacher’s Notebook can get your work done much faster than traditional applications! Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started! Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest teachersnotebook.jar {repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Teacher’s Notebook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type in the commands and press enter to execute them. Refer to Section 3: Features for more details on the commands.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

==== Updating Grades: grades

Updates the grades of the assignment identified by the index number of the assignment list of the current classroom +
This can be done for all students simultaneously or for a particular student. +
Format (All Students): `as/ASSIGNMENT_INDEX g/GRADE GRADE ... GRADE` +
Format (One Student): `as/ASSIGNMENT_INDEX s/STUDENT_INDEX g/GRADE` +

Examples:

* `grades as/1 g/10 20 30 40`
* `grades as/1 s/1 g/10`

[NOTE]
Grades must be an integer from 0 to 100, and ASSIGNMENT_INDEX must be valid (check above for definition of valid ASSIGNMENT_INDEX). For the All Students variant, the number of grades input must be equal to the total number of students in the classroom. For the One Student variant, the STUDENT_INDEX must be valid. +
The default grades of all students is "Not Submitted". Once there are no longer any "Not Submitted" grades belonging to the assignment, the assignment is marked as completed +
When a student is added, each uncompleted assignment will include the new student with the grade "Not Submitted" +
When a student is added, each completed assignment will include the new student with the grade "Late to the party". This distinguishes the whether the student was added before or after the assignment was marked (completed) by the user, and it would be unfair to expect a new student to submit work that was assigned before he/she joined the classroom.

// tag::get[]
==== Get Grades: getgrades

Gets all the grades of the chosen student index in the current classroom. +
The command result will show all the grades of the specified student. +
Format: `getgrades STUDENT_INDEX`

* `getgrades 1`

==== Get Unsubmitted Assignments: getunsubmitted

Gets all the unsubmitted assignments in the current classroom. +
The command result will unsubmitted assignments with the corresponding student names. +
Format: `getunsubmitted`

// end::get[]
// end::assignments[]

// tag::userfriendly[]
=== User-Friendly Features

The features here do not necessarily contribute directly to a teacher's everyday job, but improve the usability
of Teacher's Notebook and make using the application a more forgiving, painless and seamless experience. +

==== Autocomplete

Allows a user to toggle through suggestions that guess at what command the user wants to type in. +
Upon typing any letters that resemble commands, a popup menu will appear as shown below:

image::autocorrect/autocomplete2.jpg[auto,500,480,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

Selecting any of these suggestions results sets the text of the text field to the suggestion.


Usage:

`SHIFT + Arrow DOWN` and `SHIFT + Arrow UP` Keys to toggle between autocomplete suggestions +
`CTRL` Key to choose the first autocomplete suggestion, or turn AutoComplete on if it is turned off. +
`ESC` Key to close the autocomplete suggestions and turn off AutoComplete. +

[NOTE]
To facilitate the user learning the long and possibly tedious commands,
the AutoComplete popup menu does not hide when a user's input greater than 6 characters does not match any command.
This is why even if the input matches the suggestion, the matching part of the
suggestion is not highlighted past 6 characters.
6 characters is an arbitrary value and will be improved upon in future releases, and
with user feedback.

==== History

Allows a user to toggle through their previously entered commands,
regardless of whether the command was successful.

[IMPORTANT]
It is likely that autocomplete and history will clash, as both use the arrow keys.
We recommend that you turn the autocomplete feature off (`ESC` key) before using the
history feature.

Usage:

`Arrow UP and DOWN` Key to toggle through previous commands +

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo/Redo: Undo/Redo

Restores the database to the state before the previous undoable command was executed.

[NOTE]
Undoable commands are commands that modify the database's content: `add`, `delete`
`edit`, `clear`, `upload`.

Undo/redo cannot, however, undo actions made during previous activation of Teacher's Notebook. +
This is to say, once the application is closed, all actions done cannot be undone. +

Format: `undo` or `redo` +

Examples:

* `deletestudent 1` + `undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (applies the delete command again) +

* `liststudents` + `undo` (Error message displayed as no changes made to database)


// end::undoredo[]

==== Help

Triggers a popup window with a link to the user guide.


Format: `help` +

==== Clear

Clears all data from the notebook. If triggered erroneously, the undo command can be used to reclaim all data.


Format: `clear` +

==== Exit

Exits the application and stops all teacher's notebook processes. +

Format: `exit` +

// end::userfriendly[]


== Additional Features Coming in V2.0

//tag::reminders_for_assignments[]

=== Reminders for Assignments [coming in v2.0]

Assignments can be added to the reminders for the notebook, where users will be alerted when the deadline is up for assignments. +
Once the deadline is over, the assignments will be removed from the reminder panel, but will remain in the assignment list for future reference. +
This will give teachers a clearer idea of what they need to do in the reminder panel beyond just lessons.

//end::reminders_for_assignments[]

//tag::statistics[]

=== Statistics for Assignments [coming in v2.0]

Calculates the statistics for the chosen assignment for each classroom - Average, Median, 25th / 75th percentile etc. +
This will give teachers a clearer idea of how each classroom as a whole is doing. +
Format: `getstats ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`

//end::statistics[]

== FAQ

[qanda]
How do I transfer my data from the current notebook to another computer?::
    Copy the teachernotebook.json file from your current computer, and paste it in a /data folder in your other computer's directory where teachernotebook.jar is at.
