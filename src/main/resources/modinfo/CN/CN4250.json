    "description": "Many chemical companies are moving towards higher value-added specialty chemical products from commodities. This module prepares students with the expertise of (higher-value-added) chemical product design for such companies. It covers the basic methodology with illustrative examples from many areas such as active ingredients and personal-care products. The module involves active-learning lectures and student teaching (with feedback from the lecturer and peers) so that students will gain competence of thinking divergently and critically, and confidently solving open-ended problems through group discussion.",
