    "description": "Introduction of black holes, first with a brief review of theory, then with more emphasis on observations, including stellar-mass black hole candidates in our galaxy, the very massive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, and the super-massive black holes now understood to be at the centers of nearly every galaxy. We will learn about astronomical data that constrain the history of the growth of super-massive black holes across the last 12 billion years of cosmic history. Finally, we will consider the possible role of black hole growth in galaxy evolution.",
