    "description": "Students have been a potent force for social and political change in many parts of Asia, particularly since 1950. Arranged on a chronological and thematic basis, this module will give students an opportunity to survey the history of student activism, primarily but not exclusively, in Asian countries during this period. In emphasizing a comparative approach, the course not only looks into the causes, functions, effects, and limits of student movements in each society, but also explores intra\u2010Asian, or even global, interconnections of student activism in the second half of the twentieth century.",
