== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-gui,*`GUI`*>>: The GUI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Util,*`Utilities`*>>: Shared resources of the App.


[discrete]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-GUI]]
=== GUI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram_FlashCardPro.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]


// tag::Logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Package
image::Logic_Class_Diagram.PNG[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/logic [`Logic Package`]

The Logic package manages the internal logic of the application. +

When the User passes in their commands from the Command Line, it is passed to the `Responder` class via the method `takeInput()`.
This then passes the input String to the Responses enumerations which will parse the String into the appropriate command.
While parsing, `Responses` will consider 2 criteria:

. Only the `Responses` that exist in the `ResponseGroup` matching the `State.currState` `StateEnum` will be considered.
. Only `Responses` with a regex that matches the input String will be considered. +

As such, depending on the `StateEnum` (a.k.a. the current 'mode' of the application), only some `Responses` will be
considered. For simplicity's sake, the `Responses` that exist for each application 'mode' can be said to exist in a
specific bucket (when the application is in `TEST` mode, the `Responses` that exist in the Test bucket are `TEST_NEXT`,
`TEST_PREV` and `TEST_EXIT`). +

When the right command is found, the specific `Responses` enumeration will execute its own `ResponseFunc`, which is the
implementation of the specific command (eg a `help` command will print out the appropriate help message for the user). +

To assist with the running of certain commands, the `HelpCommand` and `CreateCommand` classes are used to abstract the logic
further.

// end::Logic[]

[[Design-Model]]

=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram_FlashCardPro.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/model[`Model`]

// tag::cards[]

`FlashCard`:

* There are 3 types of cards used by our App, the `JavascriptCard`, `FrontBackCard` and `MultipleChoiceCard`.

image::cards_class_diagram.png[]

* `JavascriptCard` and `FrontBackCard` implements from `FlashCard`, an interface class.
* `MultipleChoiceCard` inherits from `FrontBackCard`.
* The interface class `FlashCard` also implements `JsonInterface` class to allow loading and saving to Json format.

Refer to the activity diagram below to see the process of creating a `MultipleChoiceCard`:

image::MultipleChoiceCardCreation.png[]

For the `MultipleChoiceCard`, the choices provided by the user must be unique, i.e. there cannot be any duplicate in the choices provided.
If a duplicate choice is detected, then the creation of the `MultipleChoiceCard` will not be successful.

.FlashCard Priority
Each FlashCard has an associated priority level, which the user can indicate his/her value of the importance of the card.

The priority levels are described below:

[width="59%",cols="22%,<23%,<25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Priority| Value| Intended Action

| HIGH_PRIORITY| 10| Valued as important by user, should be tested more often

| LOW_PRIORITY| 1| Valued, but less important by user, should be tested less often

|=======================================================================

The sequence diagram below shows how the `ExamRunner` component can use the `createSubsetForTest()` method in the `Deck` and make use of the priorities associated with the `FlashCards` to create a test that emphasises the `FlashCards` that the user deems as important.

image::PriorityFlashCardTestSetSequenceDiagram.png[]

* Step 1: Constructor of `ExamRunner` is called.
* Step 2: In the constructor of `ExamRunner`, a method call is made to `Deck` to create a subset of cards for test.
* Step 3: If there are less than 10 cards in `Deck`, return all the cards.
* Step 4 - 10: Return a set of cards with both `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards, which the proportion is weighted at 60% to 40% ratio respectively.
* Step 11: `Deck` returns the test set to `ExamRunner`.

=== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: how to store and select the `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards
* **Alternative 1:** Use a priority queue to store the cards
** Pros: Allows the user to test the cards according to `HIGH_PRIORITY` cards first, effectively choosing only `HIGH_PRIORITY` cards first, then `LOW_PRIORITY` cards.
** Cons: Certain `LOW_PRIORITY` cards may not be tested if the test set size is smaller than the number of `HIGH_PRIORITY` cards
** Cons: FlashCard Pro cannot have the flexibility of letting the user select the number of `LOW_PRIORITY` cards in the test set.

* **Alternative 2: (Current Choice)** Maintain two lists of cards, `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards
** Pros: Can control the ratio of `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards in the test set created
** Pros: Have the flexibility to randomize the card order and choose a random set each time
** Cons: FlashCard Pro cannot have the flexibility of letting users assign more than 2 priority levels

// end::cards[]

[[Design-Storage]]
// tag::storage[]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/logic/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager.java`]
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/util/json/JsonParser.java[`JsonParser.java`]
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/util/FileReadWrite.java[`FileReadWrite.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* interface to save deck by calling `FileReadWrite`
* interface to load deck by calling `FileReadWrite`, send string to `JsonParser` and creating deck objects from `JsonValue`

The `JsonParser` component,

* takes any string of JSON format and returns a `JsonValue`

The `FileReadWrite` component,

* resolves root directory for app save data
* interface for user to provide their custom root directory
* writes file and creates path directories if none

// tag::parsejson[]
==== Implementation
The parsing is done by `JsonParser`.
It takes a string and attempts to read it as one of a `JsonValueTypes` and create its corresponding object wrapped in `JsonValue`.
Since Objects and Arrays can recursively contain a json value, their contents are also read, created and wrapped.

* `JsonParser#parseJsonInput()` -- constructs the `JsonValue` object from a string input

Given below is the overview activity diagram of parsing a json string input.

image::jsonParserProcessDynamicValue.png[]

It will first be tested to see if its an integer and if it fails it will be tested for a double.
Consequently, boolean, string, json object, json array.

Json object values are themselves json values thus the activity diagram is called recursively
Likewise for json array values.

[NOTE]
If all parsing types fail, there must be an error with the string input, thus a JsonFormatException is thrown.

==== Design Considerations

The JsonParser is designed to be a utility class with a pure function without any mutation of state.
Thus it should be self contained within a single function call.

[[Design-Util]]
=== Code Component
.Structure of the Code component within Utilities
image::CodeClassDiagram.png[]

The `Code` component supports code-running flashcards in Java and Javascript. Cards will take in user input
via the JavaScript card (Java card to be implemented soon) and

the `JavascriptRunner` class

* can evaluate JS code from a file using the `FileImporter` class
* can evaluate JS code as an input string

the `JavaRunner` class

* Read/write to the `Solution.java` file during runtime after user has typed
Java code into the file
* Compile and run `Solution.java`
* the Java code written in each card is stored in the card itself, but this `Solution.java` will be overwritten
and used to run the code in each card.

To be implemented: An in-app Flashcard Pro compiler and debugger for JS and Java as a playground for the user

=== Regex Component
// tag::regexutil[]
Having that we are using the regex approach to parsing, some common parsing and regex creation methods
are stored in the following class:

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dream/fcard/util/RegexUtil.java[`RegexUtil.java`]

RegexUtil#commandFormatRegex` creates a regex that starts with the `command` argument and lookaheads
for the elements of `args`. Thus a regex for the input `create front/asd back/dsa` can be created with
`commandFormatRegex("create", new String[]{"front/", "back/"});`.

`RegexUtil#parseCommandFormat` is an algorithm that parses user input and returns the resulting values
from the input. Following the previous example, parsing the input will create an arraylist of two arraylists.
The first arraylist contains one element `"asd"` and the second arraylist contains one element `"dsa"`;
parallel to the arguments of the input.


[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `dream.fcard.datastructures` package and root of `dream.fcard.util`

== Implementation
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== UI
The GUI of the application is started up by the `UiManager` class, when the application is initialised.
The `GUI` class handles operations on the GUI, such as rendering nodes to the application window,
and passing user command input to the `Responder` class.

// tag::test[]

=== Test
==== Implementation

The timed/un-timed test is a exam mechanism whereby users can enter a test mode that allows users to test themselves using the various flashcards. Users will then be notified of their results at the end of the test and will also have the chance to review their answers and reattempt questions.

The overall test architecture is depicted in the class diagram below.

image::TestClassDiagram.png[]

Tests are driven by the main `ExamRunner` class which ensures that only a single `Exam` object exists at any point in time.

`Exam` objects are where the bulk of the test logic resides. `Exam` objects are used to control what card the user is currently attempting via the `getCurrentCard()` method, used to control the AnchorPanes that show up on the GUI and also to keep track of score through the `Result` object within.

`Exam` objects have a *composition* relationship with `Result` objects, whereby a `Result` object cannot exist without an `Exam` object.

The sequence diagram of the three classes is as follows:

image::TestSequenceDiagram.png[]

When a user first chooses to start the test, he will call on the `createExam()` within `ExamRunner`, which will create an Exam object with the duration specified by the user.

Creating an `Exam` object automatically creates a `Result` object in the constructor. The `Exam` object is then able to interact with it via the `getResult()` method.

Responses and Controllers will then be able to get the current instance of `Exam` via the `getCurrentExam()` method in `ExamRunner`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the timed/untimed mechanism behaves at each step. The activity diagrams for Timed and Untimed Tests are also as follows:

image::UntimedTestActivityDiagram.png[]
image::TimedTestActivityDiagram.png[]

=====
Step 1. User keys in the command `test deck/DECK_NAME duration/DURATION_IN_SECONDS` (Eg. test deck/german duration/0)

Step 2. If `DURATION_IN_SECONDS` is 0, untimed test will be initiated. Else, a timed test will be initiated.

Step 3. A question will be loaded and user answers the question.

Step 4. Answer will be evaluated and if it is correct, score will be updated.

Step 5. For untimed test, repeat steps 3 and 4 until the end of deck is reached. For timed test, repeat steps 3 and 4 until either end of deck is reached or time runs out.

Step 6. If end of deck is reached, a popup will be triggered with the user's final score.

Step 7. Upon closing that popup, users will be able to review their mistakes and reattempt all questions (but it will not contribute to their score).

Step 8. When the user is done reviewing, he can type `exit` or click `Exit Session` to exit test mode and go back to the main Deck Display screen. Users can also use this command prematurely to exit test mode mid-test.
=====

==== Managing the CLI and GUI


CLI is largely driven by the `Responses` class which can be found above. However, the test mechanism differs slightly as it relies on a greater amount of `States` in order to control which commands can be used at what time.

For example, a `correct` command cannot be used on a MCQCard.

Commands are checked if they belong to a certain `ResponseGroup` for a `State`. Only commands that are registered within that state's `ResponseGroup` will be executed.

GUI is also controlled by `States` but does not go through the `ResponseGroup` class. Instead, it relies on EventHandlers triggered by button clicks. Ideally, one should make GUI go through `Responses` as well to streamline both the GUI and CLI together.

This design choice is reflected on further below.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Controlling the number of `Exam` instances.

* **Alternative 1:** Just create `Exam` whenever a user calls for a new test.
** Pros: Lesser code to write
** Cons:
*** Limited control on number of instances of an exam object
*** Potentially may lead to bugs if not well managed
*** Hard to simulate a test truly "ending" if an object can persist

* **Alternative 2: (Current Choice)** Use a singleton static class that ensures only one instance of `Exam` exists at each point in time.
** Pros:
*** Extensive control over the `Exam` object by ensuring that only one instance exists
*** Exam can be "terminated" to ensure once a test ends, users are unable to re-access it.
** Cons:
*** More complex design architecture that requires higher understanding of MVC pattern as well as Consumer Functional Interface

===== Aspect: Management of StandardExam Object

* **Alternative 1:** StandardExam class exists standalone
** Pros:
*** Lesser code to write
*** Lesser complexity in terms of polymorphism
** Cons:
*** Not open for extension.

* **Alternative 2: (Current Choice)** Use an `Exam` interface despite only one class inheriting from it
** Pros:
*** Allows the project to be open for extension. Developers may potentially develop other kinds of Exam modes (eg. speed round whereby there's a limited time *per card*)
** Cons:
*** Relatively redundant at the current version (`v1.4`)

===== Aspect: Streamlining of GUI and CLI

* **Alternative 1:** Have both GUI and CLI managed by the `Response` class
** Pros:
*** More streamlined
*** Lesser chance of performance glitches since both interfaces rely on the same logic.
** Cons:
*** Limited customization if different behaviours want to be implemented in the GUI and CLI (though unlikely).

* **Alternative 2: (Current Choice)** Individual logics for both GUI and CLI:
** Pros:
*** Greater customization.
** Cons:
*** Slightly more "spaghetti code"
*** Limited expansion as having many different types of cards will result in many different `ResponseGroups`

* While FlashCard Pro went with the "inferior" design choice for `v1.4`, there is definitely room for expansion by using an external state controller like Redux (see below).

==== Future Extensions
===== Relationship between GUI and CLI
* Currently GUI and CLI are not implemented ideally because CLI is dependent on the `Responses` class while GUI relies on button handlers.

* Ideally, GUI and CLI should both rely on the `Responses` class which will streamline the back-end logic.

* However, due to time constraints and the late discovery of the bug, `v1.4` was made with the GUI and CLI not streamlined.

* Future enhancements could either streamline the GUI and CLI both rely on `Responses` class or port over to an external state manager like Redux for better performance.

===== Exam Interface
* The Exam interface exists such that the project remains open for extension with various different test modes.

* One example would be a speed round (whereby specific time limits are set for *each card*).

// end::test[]



=== Running a code flashcard
.Activity diagram for creating a code flashcard
image::JSCardActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Proposed Implementation
The code flashcard is a card that allows users to answer coding questions by running code directly.
The  following use case illustrates how the card works.

* System: FlashCard Pro
* Actor: User
* Use case: Create a code flashcard

MSS:

. The user initialises the card for the appropriate language (i.e. Java or JS)

. The user enters starter code if necessary (e.g boilerplate code, helper methods)

. The user enters test cases (specifying inputs and corresponding expected outputs).
. FlashCard Pro saves the newly created card.

Use case ends.

*Extensions:
[start=3]
. a) The user enters 0 test cases.
    .. 1) FlashCard Pro prompts for at least 1 test case.
    .. 2) The user enters a test case.

Use case resumes from step 4.

// tag::UndoRedo[]

=== Undo/Redo Commands

Undo and Redo are commands meant to reverse any alterations to the `ArrayList` of Decks in State. As such, any mistake
can be easily recovered from. +

Please refer to the following Use case for an example of the uses of Undo/Redo.

==== Use case for Undo/Redo

* System: FlashCard Pro
* Actor: User
* Use case: Accidentally deleting the wrong deck and recovering it.

MSS:

. The user creates 2 decks: Deck1 and Deck2.

. The user wishes to delete Deck1, but accidentally deletes Deck2.

. In order to recover Deck2, the user types in the command `undo` into the CLI.

. Deck2 is recovered.

Use case ends.

*Extensions:
[start=4]

. a) The user decides that they prefer Deck2 to be deleted.
    .. ) The user types 'redo' into the CLI.
    .. ) Deck2 is deleted again.

Use case ends.

==== General Activity Diagram of Undo/Redo

===== *Before an Undo/Redo command is called:*
.Activity diagram for deck altering commands
image::DeckAlteringCommandsActivityDiagram.PNG[]
Whenever the `State`'s `decks` are altered, `State.addCurrDecksToDeckHistory()` is called. This adds a deep copy of the
current `State.decks` to `State.deckHistory`. Also, `State.resetUndoHistory()` which re-initialises `State.undoHistory`.
Then, the changes to State are carried out.

===== *When an Undo/Redo command is called:*
.Activity diagram for Undo/Redo
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.PNG[]

NOTE: The Undo and Redo commands are implemented in similar ways. As such, I will be explaining both commands simultaneously.

When an Undo/Redo command is parsed by Responder and Responses, it calls the appropriate method in `State` (for undo:
`State.undoDeckChanges()`, for redo: `State.redoDeckChanges()`). This then sets `State.deck` to the topmost ArrayList
of Decks from the appropriate Stack (for undo: `State.deckHistory`, for redo: `State.undoHistory`). +
// end::UndoRedo[]


// tag::configure_difficulty[]
=== [Proposed] Configure difficulty of test set in `test` mode

Currently, the user is restricted to a test set of 60% `HIGH_PRIORITY` and 40% `LOW_PRIORITY` cards in the test set.

In V2.0, the user should be able to configure the proportion of `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards in the test set to pitch the level of difficulty of the test.

image::ConfigurePriorityFlashCardTestSetSequenceDiagram.png[]

The ExamRunner will be expanded to allow the user to take in the ratio of `HIGH_PRIORITY`.

Then, the computation of the number of `HIGH_PRIORITY` and `LOW_PRIORITY` cards will be done according to the ratio provided by the user.

// end::configure_difficulty[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Saving and viewing user statistics

* The Statistics feature revolves around the storage and interpretation of the user's *sessions*, be it _login_ sessions or _test_ sessions.
* Therefore, the `Session` class is the main building block of all Statistics-related classes. They are stored in `SessionList` objects.
* Due to design considerations, the `UserStats` and `DeckStats` objects are intended to be singletons, created upon application startup and modified, but never duplicated or deleted.
** Thus, they are accessible via the static methods `getUserStats()` and `getDeckStats()` accessible via the `StatsHolder` class.
** This method of implementation is similar to what my teammates have used to store `State`.
** Initially, the `UserStats` and `DeckStats` objects were intended to be stored within `State` as well. However, the addition of undo/redo functionality complicated matters. Thus, the statistics objects have been decoupled from `State`.

The structure of Statistics-related classes is depicted in the class diagram below.

image::nattanyz/class diagram.png[]

Or, simplified:

image::nattanyz/class diagram simplified.png[]

The following sequence diagram depicts the starting, ending and saving of the user's `Session` when they open and close the app.

image::nattanyz/sequence diagram.png[]

==== Challenges in implementation
* Because of the custom `StorageManager` class used to load and save JSON objects, the implementation of loading and saving statistics is somewhat tightly coupled with `StorageManager`.
** It is insufficient to simply override the `toJson()` method to ensure that the statistics objects would be stored correctly. Instead, the underlying structure of the statistics objects must be known and exposed during the implementation of e.g. the `loadDeckStats()` and `saveDeckStats()` methods in `StorageManager`.
** Perhaps in v2.0, refactoring of `StorageManager` could allow for a higher level of abstraction of storage-related methods and reduced coupling between `StorageManager` and the unrelated Statistics classes.
* As our application is quite significantly different than AB3, we used an MSS-focused approach to development: i.e. we focused on making sure that the user's "happy path" could be completed via the GUI, before linking up the app's behaviour with the CLI commands. This resulted in insufficient clarity and tight coupling of the `Responses` class with other classes.
** The logic of parsing CLI input, handling incorrect commands, determining if the application is in an appropriate `State` etc., along with the actual handling of the command, is all bundled within `Responses` at present.
** In v2.0, we could focus on removing duplicated code between the CLI and GUI implementations.
** In v2.0, we could also work towards abstracting out the app's desired response to a command in `Command` classes, allowing for a `Parser` to handle CLI calls and a `Dispatcher` to handle all `Command` s, whether they originate from the CLI or GUI.
** By abstracting out the handling of each command into separate classes, each team member can check the logic of how each `Command` interacts with their component with ease and avoid duplicated code. e.g. A `startTestSessionCommand` could initialise the `ExamRunner`, update `Statistics`, and so on.
** Because of the current less-than-ideal implementation of the app's behaviour, in order to support creating/renaming/deleting decks along with undo/redo, code pertaining to `DeckStats` needed to be inserted at many disparate places in the code, e.g. within a button action in the `EditDeckDisplay` controller and in `Responses`.

==== Proposed extension: Statistics for individual cards in a deck

* Statistics for specific cards in a deck could be stored within the `Session` object representing the user's test session on a deck.
** In this way, summary statistics e.g. how many times the card was reviewed in the past week or whether the user attempted the card correctly on average, can be generated with ease.
** There is no need to store duplicated data about when each card is accessed.
* One challenge for the implementation of card-specific statistics is the tight coupling of `Responses` with other classes, as mentioned above.
** Because individual cards are prone to change, e.g. when the user edits the front or back of the card, not to mention the decks themselves can also be renamed or deleted, it is important that the implementation of `DeckStats` is fully cleaned up before work on `CardStats` can begin.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

To create an empty deck with name `German`:

* `create deck/German`

To add a Front Back card with default priority level of `low` to the deck `German`:

* `add deck/German front/hello back/moin moin`

To add a Front and Back card with priority level of `high` to the deck `German`:

* `add deck/German priority/high front/Good morning back/guten morgen`

To edit a Front and Back card's front text, with the card as the only card in the `German` deck:

* `edit deck/German index/1 front/Good bye`

To add an Multiple Choice card with priority level of `high` 3 options and the second option is the correct answer:

* `add deck/German priority/high front/Good morning back/2 choice/klair choice/guten morgen choice/moin`

To delete the first card from the `German` deck:

* `delete deck/German index/1`

To delete the deck `German`:

* `delete deck/German`
