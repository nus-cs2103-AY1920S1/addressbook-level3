    "description": "Electrophysiological disturbances have been linked to a variety of common diseases including neural, cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders. Computational models of electrophysiology have proven to be a valuable tool in gaining an insight into the pathophysiology of many diseases. In this module we will look in depth at the underlying basis for electrophysiology across a range of spatial scales and how these phenomena can be modelled computationally.",
