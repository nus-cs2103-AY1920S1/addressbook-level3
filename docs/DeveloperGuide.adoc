== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::report[]
=== [Proposed] Report feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The Report feature is implemented through a `ReportCommand` that extends from the abstract `Command` class.
It interacts with the object that implements the `Model` interface by updating it with the statistics which are wrapped in a `Statistics` object.
The following operations are added to the `Model` interface to facilitate the interaction:

* `Model#updateStatistics()` -- updates the statistics of the objecting implementing the `Model` interface.
* `Model#getStatistics()` -- gets the statistics of the current object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Report feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user starts up CaloFit for the first time. The `ModelManager` will contain a `MealLog` that has an empty list, and a `Statistics` field set to `null`.

[NOTE]
If the user enters "report" in the Command Line Input with a `MealLog` that has no `Meal` entered this month, a `CommandException` will be thrown since there are no `Meal` to gather statistics pertaining to this month.

Step 2. The user has added a `Meal` into the `MealLog` through the `add` feature.

[NOTE]
The `Statistics` field in `ModelManager` does not change when any command other than `report` is entered.

Step 3. The user enters "report" in the Command Line Input to generate the report of CaloFit. The `ReportCommand` created will call `Model#updateStatistics()`, causing a `Statistics` object to be created through `Statistics#generateStatistics()` and a `CommandResult` object to be returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the "report" command works.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: When the `Statistics` object is saved.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only when a "report" command is entered.
** Pros: Less processes carried out for each type of command.
** Cons: At any point in using CaloFit, the statistics are likely not updated to the most recent command.
* **Alternative 2:** Every command saves a new updated `Statistics` object.
** Pros: Logging of statistics can be accurate, and statistics are always updated.
** Cons: Unnecessary as user does not need to see the statistics other than through a "report" command and results in every command having to do more work and interact with the `Model` more, possibly creating more bugs.
* **Exaplanation of Choice:** Since the user only needs to see the updated statistics when a "report" command is executed, we only need to generate a new `Statistics` object with the updated values for that command, hence **Alternative 1** is chosen to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to each command.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the statistics in CaloFit.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Wrap the values in a `Statistics` object.
** Pros: Neater code and easier to understand, since all statistic-related values are stored in the `Statistics` object and are not implemented in the `Model`.
** Cons: Additional class to maintain and test for dependencies.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the values as a list in the `Model`.
** Pros: The statistics can be updated easily through the `Model` itself by updating the elements in the list. Accessing the statistics to display is easier as well.
** Cons: Burdens the `Model` with a responsibility that is largely irrelevant to its current ones, which is to keep track of the Objects that make up the CaloFit model.
* **Explanation of Choice:** To try and enforce Single Responsibility Principle as much as possible and avoid adding irrelavant functionality to `Model`.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
