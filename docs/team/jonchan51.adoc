== PROJECT: ɯeme

---

== Overview

ɯeme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, ɯeme is optimized for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users can view, tag, search, import and export a collection of meme. They can also create their own memes from meme templates.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing and future commands, as well as the design of the model of the application. The inclusion of files, as we are handling meme images, complicates a lot of logic with the existing commands. Commands that were easy to implement such as `add` were not trivial to undo when local files are being manipulated. As a result, many alternatives had to be considered before arriving to a well-planned conclusion. A thorough understanding of how the entire application functioned was necessary to ensure that the undo/redo implementation syncs well with existing and future commands, making the design of the feature much more complicated.
** Credits: Basic idea from AB4 implementation.
