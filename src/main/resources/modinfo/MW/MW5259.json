    "description": "This course will prepare students to communicate science across cultural boundaries. It will increase student\u2019s understanding about issues and effective strategies of communicating science and technology with culturally diverse audiences. Students will explore how values, beliefs and expectations differentiate science from other knowledge systems, and examine the Eurocentric privileging of modern science and its communication, which are integral parts of Western culture. In doing so, students will look closely at communities that are alienated from science, with particular reference to current science communication research.",
