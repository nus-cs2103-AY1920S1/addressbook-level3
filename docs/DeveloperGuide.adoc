== Introduction

=== Software overview

*DeliveryMANS* is a command-line application designed specifically for delivery centre administrators who are in charge of food delivery service. It encompasses a well-structured system for users to keep track and manage the entire delivery process. It facilitates food delivery service by coaliasing the delivery men, customers and restaurant menu. From auto-assigning deliverymen for deliveries when orders are made, to viewing statistics of the most popular dish of restaurants as well as customer ordering trends for further promotions, financial and business management decisions, *DeliveryMANs* is everything you need to help improve managing deliveries. With just a few simple commands, this delivery manager can help to kickstart your delivery service.

=== Purpose

This document has been created to explain the software architecture and implementations of *DeliveryMANS*. The intended audience for this document are software testers and future developers.

== Setting up

To setup *DeliveryMANS* on your system, please refer to the user guide <<UserGuide#Quick-start, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

In addition, there are 4 different contexts that the App has:

* `Universal`/`Order`
* `Customer`
* `Restaurant`
* `Deliverymen`

Each context will allow the application the execute commands in the context the application is currently in. For example, `Customer` commands can only be executed in the `Customer` context. This is to allow separation between the 4 contexts, and also the 4 databases the App has. The `Universal` context will also execute commands pertaining to `Order`.

Because of this, the context are interchangeable in the diagrams below (and the one above) as changing the context will not change how the application is structured. For example, when the diagram is shown in a `Customer` context, it will also apply in a `Restaurant` context.

However, there are differences between the 4 different context that will be explained in the <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> section.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CustomerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelArchitecture_alternative_.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the customer, restaurant, deliverymen and order data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the customer, restaurant, deliverymen and order data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.deliverymans.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo feature lets users undo and redo changes to the data stored in the app, which were
effected by commands they have executed.

==== Implementation

The main class containing the states of the data in the app is `UndoHistory`. The history is
represented as a list of states. It includes the following methods:

* `notifyChange()` -- Saves the current state in the history if it is not equal to the previous
state, as defined by its `equals()` method.
* `undo()` -- Moves its internal pointer backwards and returns the previous state.
* `redo()` -- Moves its internal pointer forwards and returns the next state.

`ModelManager` contains an `UndoHistory`, and exposes its functionality via similarly named
methods. When `undo()` or `redo()` of `ModelManager` is called, it sets its own data to that
returned by the respective methods of `UndoHistory`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.
The model data mentioned below encapsulates the data stored in the model (such as the restaurant,
customer, and deliveryman data).

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UndoHistory` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `current` state pointer pointing to that single model data state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes the `delete 5` command to delete the 5th customer in the address book. After each command, `LogicManager` calls `Model#notifyChange()`, causing the modified state of the data after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `history` list, and the `current` state pointer is shifted to the newly inserted model data state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add u/David ...` to add a new person. `LogicManager` calls `Model#notifyChange()` again, causing another modified state to be saved into the `history` list.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command does not modify the data, when `UndoHistory` checks whether the current data is equal
to the data in the previous state according to its `equals()` method, it will realise that it is
indeed equal. It will then not store the state into the `history` list.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and undoes that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `current` state pointer once to the left, pointing it to the previous state, and restores the data to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `current` state pointer is at index 0, i.e. pointing to the initial state, then there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `current` state pointer once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the data to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `current` state pointer is at index `history.size() - 1`, i.e. pointing to the latest model data state, then there are no undone states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#hasRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. If a command does not modify the data, it will not be stored in the undo history as `UndoHistory` checks for equality with the previous state. Thus, the `history` list remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#notifyChange()`. Since the `current` state pointer is not pointing at the end of the `history` list, all model data states after the `current` state pointer will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add u/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

This section discusses current and possible alternative methods to design the undo/redo function.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Is easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

Saving the entire address book was chosen because it is more straightforward. Adding logic to each
command to undo itself would be too much work given the time constraints.

===== Aspect: How undo states are copied

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make all objects in the databases immutable.
** Pros: Easy to undo and redo, and objects which are not modified can be shared, saving memory.
** Cons: Slightly more complex to understand, and every minor change requires updating the database
with a new object.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a clone method.
** Pros: Slightly simpler to reason about.
** Cons: Uses a lot of memory as each command executed requires cloning of all objects.

Making all objects immutable was chosen as it was the original design of AB3 and saves memory.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::autocompletecommands[]

=== Autocomplete commands feature

This is a feature which allows you to view all available commands matching the input keyword or letters, eliminating the need to memorize the commands or leave a browser tab open with the User Guide of this application.

==== Implementation

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by the `KeyListener` and a `Trie`, a tree-like abstract data type (ADT).
The `KeyListener` passes the current input text in the input command box to the `TrieManager` via `LogicManager#getAutoCompleteResults()`.
The `TrieManager` calls `Trie#autoCompleteCommandWord()` and a sorted list of matching commands is passed back to the `CommandBox` and is displayed on the `Ui` via a dropdown box below the user input command box.

The underlying data structure used is a directed `Graph` with the `Trie` as a `Node` and `HashMap<Character, Trie>` to represent all outgoing edges.
The `Keys` in the `HashMap` are `Characters` in the command words while the `Values` are the `Tries` containing the subsequent `Characters` in the command words.
Each `Trie` contains a `List<String>` of command words, which is returned when `Trie#autoCompleteCommandWord()` is called.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: You launch the application. The `TrieManager` initializes the respective `Tries` with their context-specific command words using `Trie#insertCommand()`.
The `Trie` adds each `Character` of the input `String` and new `Tries` into the `HashMap<Character, Trie>`, as well as the command word into the `List<String>`, recursively as illustrated by the activity diagram below.

image::AutoCompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="790"]

Step 2: You want to add an order to the database, however are uncertain how to spell the command and type in `_‘order’_`.
The `KeyListener` passes the `String` in the `CommandBox` to the `Trie` via the `LogicManager` and `TrieManager`.
The trie searches for relevant commands and pass them as a list back to the `CommandBox` via `Trie#getAutoCompleteCommandWord()`, `Trie#search()` and `Trie#getAllCommandWords()`.
The ‘Ui’ displays the relevant results in a dropdown box below the user input command box.

.Sequence diagram illustrating the handling of user input via autocomplete
image::AutoCompleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]


Step 3: You can now complete the command you want by entering the relevant command shown in the dropdown box.

image::AutoCompleteUi.png[width="790"]

==== Design Considerations

Below are a few design considerations of the autocomplete commands feature.

===== Aspect: How autocomplete executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `KeyListener` to record and handle user inputs in the user input command box before they are entered.
** Pros: Aesthetically pleasing, allows for on-the-fly display of results.
** Cons: Laborious to implement, especially in terms of debugging and troubleshooting. It may also break Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles if not implemented properly.
* **Alternative 2:** Handle user input only when the command is entered, utilizing the `Parser` to  handle user inputs and pass it to the `Trie` to be evaluated.
** Pros: Adheres to current flow of command executions, will not break any OOP principles.
** Cons: Tedious for the user, as the user will have to retype the whole command again. Furthermore, it does not look aesthetically pleasing.

Alternative 1 was selected, as it is more user friendly, and leaves a better impression onto users compared to alternative 2.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the autocomplete commands feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `Trie` to store `Characters` of commands as keys.
** Pros: Efficient and rapid searching, retrieving and displaying of results due to the tree-like ADT.
** Cons: Tedious to implement, as `Tries` are not currently implemented in Java.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a list to store all current commands.
** Pros: Easy to implement as lists are already available in Java.
** Cons: Inefficient and slow searching, because of the need to iterate through the entire list of commands while calling `.substring()` and `.contains()` methods.

Alternative 1 was selected, as it allows for faster searching and listing of relevant commands compared to alternative 2.

// end::autocompletecommands[]
// tag::orders[]
=== Order Manager
Order Manager has some useful functions specifically catered towards the ease of management of orders.

Firstly, the automated allocation of deliveryman once new orders are added or completed. When a new order is created on the database, or when an existing order is completed, a deliveryman will be assigned to deliver the new/existing pending orders based on whether he/she is present as well as whether he/she is currently preoccupied with delivering another order. This helps to ease the burden on the user as they would not need to manually allocate deliverymen to the orders. However, the feature to manually allocate is still present if the user wishes to do so.

Secondly, the Order Manager allows for sorting of orders, based on date, customer, restaurant, menu or even deliveryman, depending on what information the user wishes to see to allow for better management.

Additionally it implements the following operations:

* `-add_order` - adds an order to the database.
* `-assign_order` - assigns an available deliveryman to an existing order in the database.
* `-complete_order` - updates the completion status of an existing order in the database.
* `-delete_order` - removes an existing order in the database.
* `-edit_order` - edits an existing order in the database.
* `-list_orders` - lists all existing orders in the database.


These operations are exposed in the `ModelManager` class as `ModelManager#addOrder()`, `ModelManager#getOrder()`, `ModelManager#setOrder()`, `ModelManager#deleteOrder()` and `ModelManager#assignUnassignedOrder()`.

Order manager implements its own `Model`, `Command` and `Parser` for the `Logic Component`, `JsonOrderDatabaseStorage`, `JsonSerializableOrderDatabase`, `JsonAdaptedOrder` and `JsonAdaptedFoodOrder`, along with methods in the `StorageManager` for the `Storage Component` and lastly, `OrderCard` and `OrderListPanel` for displaying on the `Ui Component`.

.Class diagram of `Order` in `Storage Component` to illustrate the design of `Order` components
image::OrderClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

==== Implementation
Listed are the implementations of each command. The sequence of command execution for `Orders` is as follows: the `LogicManager` receives input from the user and calls `UniversalParser#parseCommand()`.
The `UniversalParser` calls the respective `OrderCommandParser#parse()` to create new `OrderCommand` objects.
The object is passed back to the `LogicManager`, and executed through `OrderCommand#execute()`. The `ModelManager` is used for the storing of changes to `Orders` (if any), and the `CommandResult` is passed back to the `LogicManager` to be displayed on the `Ui` for the user.

.Sequence diagram illustrating the execution of `Order` commands
image::OrderSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

**Add command:** `-add_order`

The add command adds an order to the `ModelManager` and `UniqueOrderList`. The `UniversalParser` invokes `AddOrderCommandParser#parse()`, which parses the target **customer**, **restaurant**, **food** and **quantity** from a *String* into *Name* and *Integer* objects.

Only valid **customer**, **restaurant**, **food** and **quantity** are allowed. This validation is done through accessing `UniqueCustomerList` and `UniqueRestaurantList` through `ModelManager#getFilteredCustomerList()`, `ModelManager#getFilteredRestaurantList()` and calling their respective `isValidName()` methods. **Food** validity will be checked through retrieving the respective using `Restaurant#getMenu()` and `Menu#isValidName()`.

Duplicated `Order` will be checked for using `ModelManager#hasOrder()` and is then added to the `UniqueOrderList` via `ModelManager#addOrder()`.

**Delete command:** `-delete_order`

The delete command deletes an `Order` from the `ModelManager` and `UniqueOrderList` by a specified index. The `UniversalParser` invokes `DeleteOrderCommandParser#parse()` and user input is used to get the index of the `Order` to be deleted.

**Edit command:** `-edit_order`

The edit command edits an `Order` in the `UniqueOrderList` of the `ModelManager` by its specified `ORDERNAME`. The `UniversalParser` invokes `EditOrderCommandParser#parse()` which parses the target **customer**, **restaurant**, **food** and **quantity** (if present) from a *String* into *Name* and *Integer* objects.

Only valid **customer**, **restaurant**, **food** and **quantity** are allowed. This validation is done through accessing `UniqueCustomerList` and `UniqueRestaurantList` through `ModelManager#getFilteredCustomerList()`, `ModelManager#getFilteredRestaurantList()` and calling their respective `isValidName()` methods. **Food** validity will be checked through retrieving the respective using `Restaurant#getMenu()` and `Menu#isValidName()`.

Valid edition of `Orders` will be checked through `AddOrderCommand#isValidOrder()`.

**Assign command:** `-assign_order`

The assign command assigns an unassigned `Order` to a random available **deliveryman** in the `UniqueOrderList` of the `ModelManager` by its specified `ORDERNAME`. The `UniversalParser` invokes `AssignOrderCommandParser#parse()` which parses the target **Order** from a *String* into a *Name* object.

The **deliveryman** will then be allocated using `ModelManager#getOneAvailableDeliveryman()`.

**Complete command:** `-complete_order`

The complete command completes an `Order` that is already assigned by its specified `ORDERNAME` in the `UniqueOrderList` of the `ModelManager`. The `UniversalParser` invokes `CompleteOrderCommandParser#parse()` which parses the target **Order** from a *String* into a *Name* object.

Validation will be done through checking the *Name* of the assigned **deliveryman** to ensure that it is not unassigned, as well as checking the completion status of the order using `Order#isCompleted()`.

It also updates the **restaurant** and its **quantity** through `ModelManager#getFilteredRestaurantList()` and `Restaurant#updateQuantity()`.

**List command:** `-list_order`

The list command lists all orders currently in the `ModelManager`. The `UniversalParser` creates a new `ListOrderCommand` object, which changes the `Context` of the `ModelManager` to **Context.GLOBAL**.

This then updates the `Ui` to display the order list.

==== Design Considerations

Below are a few design considerations of the Order manager class.

===== Aspect: Data structure for modelling, storage and utilization of `Order`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make use of existing data structures as references to create new data structures needed for the implementation of an Order Manager.
** Pros: Straightforward to implement.
** Cons: Tedious to implement as several regions of the codebase needs to be edited for `Order` to run, display and save successfully.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement data structures from scratch.
** Pros: Pride and accomplishment of implementing data structures from scratch.
** Cons: Tedious and time wasting to code the necessary classes.

Alternative 1 was selected, as it is much faster to implement compared to alternative 2, given the short time spam of 6 weeks to complete the project.

// end::orders[]

// tag::statsfeature[]
=== Deliverymen status statistics feature

Tracking the amount of available manpower you have at any point in time is very crucial to deal with sudden changes in food orders.
This is a feature which allows the user to effectively manage the deliverymen by providing relevant statistics in regards to their status.
The user will be able to foresee and hence prepare for any sudden shortage or excess in manpower.
Relevant statistics include current utilization level and activity level of the deliverymen.

NOTE: A deliveryman can have any of the 3 status: *AVAILABLE*, *UNAVAILABLE*, *DELIVERING*. To effectively manage their status, 3 different lists
are used to categorise all the deliverymen based on their status. This way of implementation is efficient when it comes to sorting or searching for a deliveryman.

==== Implementation

The statistics feature is primarily managed by the `StatisticsManager`, which has access to the status of every deliveryman in the database through the 3
status lists - lists of available deliverymen, unavailable deliverymen and delivering deliverymen respectively.
The `StatisticsManager` obtains these 3 status lists from the `StatusManager` and passes it to the `Analyzer` to compute the relevant data, which in turn
returns a filled `StatisticsRecordCard` containing the computed statistics.

From the status lists, the Analyzer computes two data:

* Utilization Level
** This signals to the user the amount of available manpower that is not utilized. It is the percentage of the number of deliverymen who are working (ie. delivering an order) over the number of active deliverymen (ie. available or delivering an order) .
** It is computed as follows:
*** *UtilizationLevel =  DeliveringMen / (AvailableMen + DeliveringMen) x 100*

* Activity Level
** This signals to the user the amount of active manpower. It is the percentage of the number of deliverymen who are active deliverymen over the total number of deliverymen.
** It is computed as follows:
*** *ActivityLevel =  (AvailableMen + DeliveringMen) / (TotalMen) x 100*

With this structure, it implements the following operation:

* `DeliverymenDatabase#analyzeDeliverymenStatus()` -- Retrieves a filled record card containing all the relevant statistics regarding deliverymen statuses


This feature requires a high degree of interaction between the `Status` component and `Statistics` component of `DeliverymenDatabase`.
This interaction of the relevant classes are illustrated in the class diagram below.

.Partial Structure of Deliverymen Database
image::StatisticsFeatureClassDiagram.png[]

The `DeliverymenDatabase` acts as an agent for both components to parse information around. This helps to maintains a clear
separation of concerns to carry out different functions.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `stats` operation works:

.Sequence Diagram of Retrieving Deliverymen Statistics
image::DeliverymenStatistics.png[]

As seen in Figure 10, for every use of the `stats` command, a `RecordCard` object is created. The `Analyzer` will take in the status lists and the `RecordCard`
to compute and record the results onto the `RecordCard. Subsequently, it will return the edited `RecordCard` to the `StatisticsManager`.

NOTE: The above explanation and sequence diagram (Figure 10) only illustrates what happens inside the `Model` component of the architecture
when the `stats` command is used. The higher-level components such as `LogicManager`  are left out, even though they are
also involved in the execution of this command.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Analysing the status lists

This feature necessitates the analysis of the status lists. A consideration is the design of the architecture in which the statistics feature
should be implemented. It may be subtle in the current version of *DeliveryMANS*, but will have significant implications when the app is further developed.

* Alternative 1(current choice): Create another class (`StatisticsManager`) to deal with all the statistics-related methods.
** Pros: Allows for a more structured and object-oriented way of executing out the `stats` command. This makes it easier to extend additional
statistics-related enhancements in future, such as adding predictive capabilities to predict the utilisation level over the next few weeks.
** Cons: More inefficient as the status lists from `StatusManager` have to be passed through different classes before reaching `StatisticsManager`.
This can affect the runtime of the command when the enhancements get more complicated.

* Alternative 2: Modify the existing `StatusManager` to handle statistics computation as well.
** Pros: More convenient as the status lists can be directly obtained from the same class instead of having to pass it around.
** Cons: Harder to manage in future as the app is improved due to coupling between status management and statistics management.
Changes to status-related issues may cause regressions to the statistics feature.

// end::statsfeature[]

// tag::auto tagging customer cuisine
=== Automated tagging of customer

Tags determine the customer's favourite cuisine. It is helpful to the user as having this information will enable the user to make better analysis on the current trend of food. Although we can opt for the user to manually add in tags, it might be problematic once the number of customers in the database gets too large for a single user to handle. Thus, this feature aids the user by automatically tagging the customer based on the customer's order history.

==== Implementation

The `Tag` of the `Customer` is related to the `Tag` of the `Restaurant`. If an `Order` has been added to the database, the `Tag` of the `Restaurant` will be added to the `Tag` of the `Customer`. If the `Customer` has multiple ``Order``s, the `Tag` that will be shown on the `CustomerCard` will be the highest two ``Tag``s. This is the main process on how the application automatically tags the customers.

An activity diagram below shows the automated tagging process when adding an order:

[[fig-AutoTaggingDiagram]]
.Activity diagram of tagging process
image::plantuml/AutoTagAddActivityDiagram.png[]

Another function called `changeMainTag()` is used to change the main ``Tag``s of the `Customer` to show on the `CustomerCard`. The activity diagram below shows how the application determines the top two ``Tag``s:

[[fig-ChangingTagsDiagram]]
.Activity diagram of changing ``Customer``'s main ``Tag``s
image::plantuml/ChangeTagActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

*Aspect: Method of editing ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Adding, deleting and editing of `Order` will edit the ``Tag``s in `Customer`.

** Pros: Only the commands that add, delete or edit an `Order` will require editing the ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s.

** Cons: Creates more dependency between `Customer` and `Command` classes.

* *Alterative 2:* `Customer` storing a list of ``Order``s and iterate through that list to get the number of ``Tag``s.

** Pros: Editing ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s only happen in the `Customer` object itself and doesn't need to depend on information from other objects.

** Cons: Every single change to any `Order` has to be reflected on ``Customer``'s `Order` list. Including edits to ``Order``s made in `Deliverymen` and `Restaurant` context. This makes `Customer` have a lot of dependency with other classes.

We chose to go with the first alternative as `Customer` class will have lesser dependency with other classes when editing tags. In addition, displaying the ``Customer``'s order history will only require `Customer` to access the `OrderDatabase` to get the list of orders. Both of these requirements together still makes the `Customer` class have lesser dependency with other classes compared to implementing the second alternative that makes the `Customer` class have dependencies with every `Order` related classes.

*Aspect: Method of storing ``Tag``s*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Using a map to store the ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s where key is the `Tag` and value is the number of tags.

** Pros: Faster access of ``Tag``s in the map and getting the number of a certain ``Tag`` only takes O(1) time.

** Cons: More memory is needed to store the information. A map to store all ``Tag``s and a set to store the main ``Tag``(s) to display on `CustomerCard`.

* *Alternative 2:* Using a list that stores all ``Tag``s that are in `Customer`.

** Pros: The list is capable of storing all of the ``Tag``s that `Customer` has.

** Cons: The list needs to be iterated through to determine the top ``Tag``(s) of `Customer`.

We chose to go with alternative 1 as we believe speed is more important to the user and sacrificing memory space is the better choice.

=== EditMode for restaurants
A `Restaurant` object contains many attributes. On top of a `Name`, `Location`, `Rating` and a list of `Tag`,
it also includes a list of `Food` as its menu, as well as a list of `Order`. This makes it difficult to edit
an entire `Restaurant` object using just one `Command`.

The EditMode feature allows editing of a specific `Restaurant` object's details (name, location, rating, tags),
menu and orders individually under 1 interface, using different commands.

==== Implementation
**Model**:

In addition to the `filteredRestaurantList` that contains all the restaurants in the restaurant database,
`ModelManager` now contains a `editingRestaurantList`, which holds and allows access to the single restaurant
currently under EditMode.

When user inputs the `editmode INDEX` command:

* The restaurant referenced by the `INDEX` in the list of restaurants will be placed
in the `editingRestaurantList` via the function call `Model#setEditingRestaurant(Restaurant editingRestaurant`.
* Subsequent commands that edit the restaurant, such as `AddFoodCommand`, `DeleteFoodCommand`, `AddRatingCommand`
and `EditDetailsCommand` will create a new restaurant with the edited attributes.
* The outdated restaurant will be replaced with the new edited restaurant
in both the `filteredRestaurantList` and `editingRestaurantList` via the function call
`Model#setRestaurant(Restaurant oldRestaurant, Restaurant newRestaurant)`.

**Logic**:

The `Logic` for EditMode is facilitated by `Context` enum type, which contains the following constants:
`GLOBAL`, `CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `DELIVERYMEN` and `EDITING`. It determines the `Context` the application is in,
as well as the commands the user can access. It is contained inside `LogicManager` as an attribute. `EditModeCommand` is only
accessible in `Context.RESTAURANT`, and entering a valid `EditModeCommand` will change the `Context` to `Context.EDITING`.

The following class diagram shows the relevant structure of `Logic` and `Parser`:

image::developerguide\ParserClassDiagram.png[]

When the user inputs a command:

* `userInput` will always be parsed by `UniversalParser` first, regardless of the current `Context`.
The reason for this is to check for universal commands, which are accessible in all `Context`.
* Subsequently, if the command word in `userInput` matches none of the universal commands, then `UniversalParser`
will create a context specific `Parser` based on the current `Context`, i.e. `CustomerParser`, `RestaurantParser`,
`DeliverymenParser`, `EditingParser`, which takes over and parses the `userInput`.
Any context switching command will then change the `Context` in `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when the user enters a command:

image::developerguide\ParserActivityDiagram.png[]

When user inputs the `editmode INDEX` command:

* `UniversalParser` will parse it first.
* Since `editmode` matches none of the universal commands, `UniversalParser` will create a new `RestaurantParser`
(since current `Context` is `Context.RESTAURANT` as `EditModeCommand` is only accessible in said `Context`).
* The new `RestaurantParser` will then parse the `userInput` and subsequently change the `Context` in `LogicManager` to `Context.EDITING`,
unlocking commands to edit the restaurant, such as `AddFoodCommand`, `DeleteFoodCommand`, `AddRatingCommand`
and `EditDetailsCommand`.

**UI**:

Commands that change the UI will either:

* Pass its command class to `MainWindow` in the UI package if the command doesn't change the `Context`
* Pass the new `Context` to `MainWindow` in the UI package if the command changes the `Context`.

as the second parameter of the `CommandResult` returned by the command.

When `MainWindow` receives the `CommandResult`, it will extract out either the command class or `Context` from
`CommandResult` and make changes to the UI accordingly via the function call
`MainWindow#changeDisplay(Context context)` or `MainWindow#changeDisplay(Class commandClassName)`.

When user inputs the `EditModeCommand`:

* Since `Context` is changed to `Context.EDITING`, it will be passed as the second parameter of the `CommandResult`
returned by the `EditModeCommand`.
* Upon receiving this new `Context`, `MainWindow` will call the function `changeDisplay(Context.EDITING)` to change
the UI. An extra `StackPane` showing the restaurant under EditMode will be displayed,
while the `SplitPane` displaying the list of restaurants originally will now be filled with the restaurant's `Food` menu
and `Order` list.

The following sequence diagram summarises how the `EditModeCommand` changes the UI:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Structure of `Logic` and `Parser`
* **Current:** `LogicManager` contains only the `UniversalParser`, which then creates a context-specific parser
depending on the current `Context` in `LogicManager`.
** Pros: Checking whether `userInput` is a universal command only needs to be done once in `UniversalParser`
** Cons: Doesn't make as much sense for `UniversalParser` to be able to create other context-specific parsers.
* **Alternative:** Instead of containing only the `UniversalParser`, which then creates the other 4 context-specific
parsers, `LogicManager` contains all 5 parsers.
** Pros: Makes more sense to have `LogicManager` containing all 5 parsers which parses `userInput` individually based
on the current context.
** Cons: Checking whether `userInput` is a universal command needs to be repeated in each parser.

===== Aspect: Changing of UI
* **Current:** If the `Command` that changes the UI does not change the `Context`, pass its command name
to `MainWindow` instead of creating a new `Context` to signal a change in UI.
** Pros: Does not create unnecessary `Context`.
** Cons: 2 method signatures are needed for `MainWindow#changeDisplay` to change the UI.
* **Alternative:** A new `Context` is created for every `Command` that changes the UI.
** Pros: Only 1 method signature is needed for `MainWindow#changeDisplay` to change the UI.
** Cons: Creates many unnecessary `Context` that `LogicManager` will never be in.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* has to juggle among several fronts (customer side, deliverymen side and restaurant side) and act as the point of contact among them
* prefers a centralised app that brings all 3 fronts together for better management
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Our application allows better management of all fronts for delivery-service-command-centre administrators, and allows for more efficiency and control in handling of daily tasks.
