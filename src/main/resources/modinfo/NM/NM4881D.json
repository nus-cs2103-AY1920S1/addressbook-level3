    "description": "In order to better understand civic communication, many scholars have turned to the concept of the 'public sphere': the space in society where political decisions can be debated openly to affect change. This course explores theories of the public sphere and considers significant debates. Is the public sphere inherently democratic or is it exclusionary? Do modern media contribute to healthy public discussion or do they distort public communication? Has the Internet created a powerful new 'digital' public or has it polarized political dialogue? We will discuss these questions and more with reference to historical and contemporary examples of public communications.",
