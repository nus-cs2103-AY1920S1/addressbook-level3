    "description": "It is often thought that we ought to be just, kind, generous and more; in short, that we ought to be moral. But why be moral rather than simply heeding our unjust, callous, and selfish urges? In this course, we examine this question systematically, both from the perspective of philosophers who attempt to answer it (like Plato, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume) and from the perspective of philosophers who deny that it has any satisfactory answer (like John Mackie).",
