However this increase in lifespan has brought to the forefront a rise in many age-related diseases. These diseases, which include cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, are now a focus of health care in the 21st century. This course describes many of these diseases, and their diagnosis and treatment using advanced technology found in modern hospitals.
