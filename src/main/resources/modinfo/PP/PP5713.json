    "description": "This course would seek to provide an in-depth understanding of the important role played by the financial sector in a modern economy, including the potential contribution of a vibrant financial sector to economic growth and financial stability. The course would examine the preconditions for a strong financial sector and measures available to policymakers for strengthening the financial sector. Particular emphasis would be placed on the special challenges of building strong financial sectors in developing countries. Much of the course would focus on financial regulation and supervision, its rationale and relationship to financial sector development. The two broad types of financial regulation, prudential and market conduct would be examined and consideration would be given to the characteristics of an effective system of regulation and supervision. Attention would also be given to financial crises, their capacity to undermine economic development and techniques available to policy makers, central bankers and regulators for minimizing the risks and consequences of financial crises.",
