{empty} +

====
*Command Format for this User Guide*

* Arguments are fully capitalized which are to be supplied by you.
- E.g. `*add_task* TASK`

* Arguments suffixed with ellipsis (`...`) indicate that the argument can be entered zero or more times.
- E.g. `*delete_task* INDEX...`

* Parameters separated by a vertical bar `|` can be used interchangeably.
- e.g. given the command format `-d|--description DESCRIPTION`, the following inputs accomplish the same thing:

=== Asking for help : `help` **`[coming in v2.0]`**

Provides a guide if you ever need help with Horo's commands and command formats.

Command Format: +
`*help*`

{empty} +

=== Calendar, Events and Task

The following commands are related to Events and Tasks, which Horo recognises as different entities. Stated below are the differences between Events and Tasks:

* Event:
- Will show up on the Calendar.
- Cannot be marked as done. **`[coming in v2.0]`**
- Will be automatically removed from the Calendar past its due date, provided it is a non-recurring event.

* Task
- Will show up on the Calendar only if a due-date is specified. Otherwise it will be specified in the List.
- Can be marked as done. **`[coming in v2.0]`**
- If not accomplished by its due date, will be automatically archived into an undone list.

=== Notification System
Horo will post notifications to your system tray to remind you that an event is starting or that a task is due.

Take note that Horo can only post reminders as long as the application is open. To tell if Horo is running, check that the appropriate icon appears in the system tray

.Horo tray icon
image::HoroIconScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +
Also take note that notifications are switched on by default upon launch. This status is not carried over between sessions. If you would like to switch notifications off, you would have to do so whenever you start Horo up.

You can tell if notifications are switched on by mousing over the icon in the system tray.

.Mousing over the Horo tray icon
image::IconMouseOverScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

==== Notification Popups
When Horo posts a notification, it should appear at the bottom-right side of the screen, where the system tray should be.

.A Popup Notification
image::PopUpScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

Take note that that following commands are UI-related commands, and are thus unaffected by the `undo` and `redo` commands (For more information, see <<Undo-Redo>>).

==== Switch notifications on
The `notif_on` command switches notifications on. +

Command Format: +
`*notif_on*`

{empty} +
1. If you would like to switch notifications on, type the command *`notif_on`* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

.`notif_on` command in the Command Box
image::NotificationOnCommandBoxScreenShot.png[]

.Feedback for the `notif_off` command
image::NotificationOffFeedbackScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

=== Undo-Redo
The following commands allow you to undo and redo previously input commands.

The below commands will only affect state-changing, and not UI-related commands. The commands that will be affected are as follows:

* *add_event*
* *delete_event*
* *edit_event*
* *add_task*
* *delete_task*
* *edit_task*


==== Undo

.Undo Command
image::UndoCommandScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

The `undo` command undoes the previous command. +
Commands can be undone up to the program's launch.

Command Format: +
`*undo*`

{empty} +

Example:
Suppose that you have deleted the wrong task from Horo. Rather than having to type the `add_task` command
along with the description of the deleted task (to add back the wrongly deleted task), you can simply type in `undo`,
which will revert Horo to the state before the deletion of the wrong task was executed.

This means Horo is now restored to its desired state, as if you did not commit the deletion mistake at all!
You can now proceed to delete the right task.

Illustration:
Suppose that we wanted to delete task 2 in the list, but deleted task 3 instead.
(Horo also has a list view on top of the calendar view; I will illustrate the feature with with the list view)

To undo:

1. Type undo in the command box, and press the Enter key to execute it. +

.`undo` command in the Command Box
image::undoScenario1.png[]

{empty} +
2. The result box will display the message: “Previous command has been undone!” +

.Feedback for the `undo` command
image::undoScenario2.png[]

{empty} +
3. You can see that the wrongly deleted task (task 3) is visible in the list once again. +

.Result of the `undo` command
image::undoScenario3.png[]

[NOTE]
*The `undo` command undoes previous commands in reverse chronological order.* +
{empty} +
Suppose that you have executed the following commands in this order: +
{empty} +
1.	Adding a task +
2.	Editing a task +
{empty} +
Now, if you execute the `undo` command, you will first revert Horo to the state before a task was edited.
Then, if you execute `undo` again, you will revert Horo to the state before a task was added. +
{empty} +
*The `undo` command only works on state-changing commands.* +
{empty} +
State-changing commands are those that manipulate task and event data stored in Horo. Examples include `add_task`, `delete_task` and `edit_task`.
`Undo` commands only work on these types of commands because there is an actual change in the state of Horo that can be undone. +
{empty} +
On the other hand, non-state-changing commands include `find` and `help`. These commands are only concerned with producing
user output for the user in the GUI, but do not modify any of the data stored in Horo. As such, these types of commands
are ignored by the `undo` operation since there is nothing to `undo`. +
{empty} +
As such, if we first add a task to Horo, then we call the `help` command, calling `undo` will ignore the `help` command and proceed
to revert Horo to before a task was added. +
{empty} +
*The `undo` command only executes if there are previous states to revert back to.* +
{empty} +
If no command has been previously executed, or if Horo has already been reverted to the earliest possible state by multiple `undos`,
then calling `undo` further will amount to no effect.

{empty} +

==== Redo

.Redo Command
image::RedoCommandScreenShot.png[]

{empty} +

The `redo` command redoes a previously undone command.
The `redo` command is able to redo any undone commands that have not been succeeded by a separate state-changing command
(e.g. add_event, delete_event, edit).

If you had executed any state-changing command (except for `undo` or `redo`) just after undoing the `add_event` command,
calling redo will then amount to no effect.

If you've ever used another application with undo-redo functionality, just imagine that Horo's undo-redo functions are as intuitive as theirs.


Command Format: +
`*redo*`

{empty} +

Illustration:
Suppose that you wrongly deleted task 3 from the list, but actually wanted to delete task 2 instead.
As a result, you type in the `undo` command, and Horo is restored to the previous state where task 3 still exists.

However, now you decide that you want to remove task 3 from the list after all. Without having to key in the `delete_task` command,
you can simply type in `redo` and the most recent command that was undone (the deletion of task 3) will be re-executed.
This results in a list where task 3 is deleted.

To redo:

1. Type redo in the command box, and press the Enter key to execute it. +

.`redo` command in the Command Box
image::undoScenario4.png[]

{empty} +
2. The result box will display the message “Previous undone command has been redone!” +

.Feedback for the `redo` command
image::undoScenario5.png[]

{empty} +
3. You can see that task 3 has been removed from the list. +

.Result of the `redo` command
image::undoScenario6.png[]

[NOTE]
*The `redo` command redoes previously undone commands in reverse chronological order.* +
{empty} +
Suppose that you have executed the following commands in this order: +
{empty} +
1.	Adding a task +
2.	Editing a task +
{empty} +
As discussed in Undoing a previous command, if we run `undo` twice, we will revert Horo to before a task was edited,
and then revert Horo to before a task was added. +
Our sequence of `undo` commands are in this order: +
{empty} +
1.	Undo editing of a task +
2.	Undo adding of a task +
{empty} +
Now, if we run the `redo` command, Horo will be restored to the state after the task was added. If we execute redo again,
Horo will be restored to the state after the task was edited. +
{empty} +
*The `redo` command only executes if the most recent state-changing command(s) are undo commands.* +
{empty} +
If no `undo` command has been executed since the starting up of Horo, or `undo` commands have been executed
but other state-changing commands were executed after those `undos`, then executing the `redo` command amounts to no effect. +
{empty} +
For example, let’s say I deleted a task from the list, undid that deletion, and then added another task to the list.
Executing the `redo` command here will not do anything because `add_task` was executed after the `undo`.

{empty} +

=== iCalendar (ICS) Integration

Horo stores data in the ICS format. Files saved in this format have the extension `.ics`.
