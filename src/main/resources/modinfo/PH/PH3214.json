    "description": "The course will consider, side by side, certain `philosophical' works of literature and more orthodox philosophical works. The idea is to explore the ways and degrees to which it makes sense - also, the ways and degrees to which it does not make sense - to say that this work of fiction (a novel, say) is really about the same thing that this philosophical text is about. Turning the point around: when philosophers - like Plato or Nietzsche - employ literary techniques more characteristic of fiction, what philosophical work is hereby done?",
