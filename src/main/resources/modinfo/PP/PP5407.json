    "description": "Policy evaluation is critical in helping to decide whether to expand, modify, or terminate a program or policy. The objective of this module is to provide students with the knowledge and skills required to understand and conduct policy evaluation. The module will build on the foundational analytical skills taught in PP5406. The focus is on rigorous quantitative evaluation tools. These will be taught using case studies and datasets that will allow students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these methods and learn how to apply them to a policy problem of their choice.",
