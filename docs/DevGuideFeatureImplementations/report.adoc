=== [Proposed] Report feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The Report feature is implemented through a `ReportCommand` that extends from the abstract `Command` class.
It returns `CommandResult` object that has the boolean "isReport" set to True.
The `MainApp` Ui component will check the `CommandResult` for the "isReport" boolean and create a new `ReportWindow` through the `MainApp#handleReport()` method.
The `ReportWindow` object takes in a `Statistics` object that is created by calling `Logic#getStatistics()` which subsequently calls `Model#getStatistics()`.
Additionally, the following operation is also implemented:

* `Model#getStatistics()` -- gets the statistics of the current object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Report feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user starts up CaloFit for the first time. The `ModelManager` will contain a `MealLog` that has an empty list

[NOTE]
If the user enters "report" in the Command Line Input with a `MealLog` that has no `Meal` entered this month, a `CommandException` will be thrown since there are no `Meal` to gather statistics pertaining to this month.

Step 2. The user has added a `Meal` into the `MealLog` through the `add` feature.

Step 3. The user enters "report" in the Command Line Input to generate the report of CaloFit. The `ReportCommand` created will return a `CommandResult` object with "isReport" set to True. When the `MainWindow` checks this boolean, it calls `MainWindow#handleReport()` that creates the `ReportWindow`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the "report" command works.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: When the `Statistics` object is saved.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only when a "report" command is entered.
** Pros: Less processes carried out for each type of command.
** Cons: At any point in using CaloFit, the statistics are likely not updated to the most recent command.
* **Alternative 2:** Every command saves a new updated `Statistics` object.
** Pros: Logging of statistics can be accurate, and statistics are always updated.
** Cons: Unnecessary as user does not need to see the statistics other than through a "report" command and results in every command having to do more work and interact with the `Model` more, possibly creating more bugs.
* **Explanation of Choice:** Since the user only needs to see the updated statistics when a "report" command is executed, we only need to generate a new `Statistics` object with the updated values for that command, hence **Alternative 1** is chosen to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to each command.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store the statistics in CaloFit.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Wrap the values in a `Statistics` object.
** Pros: Neater code and easier to understand, since all statistic-related values are stored in the `Statistics` object and are not implemented in the `Model`.
** Cons: Additional class to maintain and test for dependencies.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the values as a list in the `Model`.
** Pros: The statistics can be updated easily through the `Model` itself by updating the elements in the list. Accessing the statistics to display is easier as well.
** Cons: Burdens the `Model` with a responsibility that is largely irrelevant to its current ones, which is to keep track of the Objects that make up the CaloFit model.
* **Explanation of Choice:** To try and enforce Single Responsibility Principle as much as possible and avoid adding irrelavant functionality to `Model`.
