    "description": "Sign processes permeate the lives of all creatures in the natural world. Sign use makes possible not only such higher-order human abilities as spoken language and written texts, but also underlies such communicative animal behaviour as the calls and songs of birds and cetaceans; the pheromone trails of insect colony organisation and interaction; the mating, territorial, and hierarchical display behaviour in mammals; as well as the deceptive scents, textures, movements and coloration of a wide variety of symbiotically interacting insects, animals and plants. This course will introduce you to the recently developed field of biosemiotics the interdisciplinary study of sign processes as they occur variously across the biological spectrum. Looking at the close relation between living systems and their sign systems (hence the term: bio-semiotics), this still-emerging discipline seeks to traces the evolutionary development of sign-mediated ways of being in the world from its beginnings in the transmission of information across single cells to its most complicated realisation in the abstract forms of human thought.",
