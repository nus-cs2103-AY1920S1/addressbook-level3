    "description": "Forgery is a perennial problem and exists everywhere \u2013 in fake jewellery, counterfeit medications, fake death to scam insurance, fake signatures. The question this module seeks is how do we use forensic science to expose forgery for justice to be meted out. Students will learn fundamental scientific concepts and will apply them in case studies, such as establishing anachronism in cheques and wills; determining whether the person is dead or alive when an insurance payout for his death was made and if the gold bars which were stolen were indeed gold.",
