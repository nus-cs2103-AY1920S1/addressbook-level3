    "description": "Objectives: This module will introduce how digital media can be used to explore design possibilities. The module will question how these techniques can shape the design process and change the language of design.\n\n\n\nTopics: The module will be broken down into five parts: \n\n\u2022    tools will give a broad overview of the different types of tools and their role in design; \n\n\u2022    modelling will focus on the digital representation and manipulation of 3D form, \n\n\u2022    mapping will focus on mapping between 2D and 3D representations; \n\n\u2022    visualizing will focus on the use of image generation techniques to evaluate designs; and \n\n\u2022    prototyping will focus on the use of prototyping technology to explore issues of constructability.",
