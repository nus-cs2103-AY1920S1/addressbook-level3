    "description": "The module covers topics on: Linear elasticity in which the general equations of equilibrium and compatibility are derived and its applications are illustrated for complex problems; Unsymmetrical bending of beams; Stresses in pressurized thick-walled cylinders in elastic and elasto-plastic regions; Stresses in rotating members; Introduction to mechanics of composite materials; and Experimental stress analysis with particular emphasis on optical methods. This is an elective module and is intended for students in Stage 3 and 4 who have an interest in the stress analysis of isotropic and composite materials. The materials in this module are applicable to chemical, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering.",
