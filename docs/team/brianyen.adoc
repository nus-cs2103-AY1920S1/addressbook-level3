== PROJECT: Alfred - The Hackathon Butler

---

== Overview
As part of a Software Engineering project, my team and I were tasked with transforming an existing AddressBook desktop application
into any application of our choice, so long as it maintained a Command Line Interface and had a Graphical Display. We chose to
transform the existing application into a Hackathon manager that is capable of managing the different workflows required for any
Human Resource/Administrative Manager to organise a Hackathon. Named after Batman's trusty butler, Alfred allows Hackathon
organisers to keep track of the individuals taking part in the Hackathon, assign participants to teams, visualise statistics
and even import data from .csv files.

After several rounds of iterations and improvements, we are proud to present Alfred:

My main contribution to the team was to adapt the existing Storage implementation to fit the new application's purpose, and
to implement the `undo`, `redo` and `history` features. In addition to this, I also implemented the Command History Navigation
feature, which allows users to navigate to previously executed commands using keyboard shortcuts - a near-universal convenience
feature provided in several Command Line prompts.

== Summary of contributions
=== Features Contributions
* *Major Enhancement* Adapted Storage to fit the needs of Alfred.
** Purpose: My contribution was to allow Alfred's data types to be stored to and read from disc.
I also ensured that Alfred's various EntityLists could be serialized
to JSON and saved to disc in a convenient manner, while guaranteeing that all data read from disc is first validated before
being sent to Alfred so that corrupted data will not cause further problems upstream.
** Justification: Storage is a key component in Alfred and ensures that all data changes can be automatically saved and
persisted. This is critical for Alfred. Hackathon-organising is a long-term, large-scale effort, so being able to save your
data reliably is key to the application's success.
** Highlights: There is no need for users to save their data as Alfred always automatically saves the data to Storage.
* *Major Enhancement* Created an undo/redo feature.
** Purpose: Allows users to undo/redo previously executed commands. This allows users to easily correct mistakes while using Alfred.
** Justification: Should users make a mistake or have a need to reverse previously executed commands, this feature allows them
to quickly revert changes by invoking the `redo` command, improving their overall productivity and streamlining workflows with the application. Should they
change their mind and actually wish to execute the command again, there is no need for them to re-type and execute the command,
as they can simply invoke the `redo` command.
** Highlights: You can undo/redo multiple commands at once, by invoking `undo N`/`redo N`, where N is an integer.
* *Minor Enhancement* Allow users to view the history of previously executed commands
** Purpose: Allows users to keep track of the changes they make
** Justification: Especially after invoking several commands, it can be difficult for users to remember the order of commands they
had previously executed. Hence, the `history` command provides a convenient visualisation of previously executed commands to
better inform users on which commands they would like to `undo`/`redo`.
* *Minor Enhancement* Allow users to navigate to previously executed commands using the ALT + UP/DOWN Arrow Keys
* Purpose: Allow quick access to previously executed commands, as opposed to re-typing everything.
* Justification: This is a convenience feature that most Command Line prompts have, so it is a nice feature for Alfred to
include, given that Alfred is ultimately a Command Line Interface.
** Highlights: Users can navigate up to 50 previous commands.

=== Other Contributions
These are some of the other ways I have helped my team along the way to develop Alfred.

* Project management:
** Helped manage releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` on GitHub
* Tests
** Helped write tests to ensure that test code coverage is maintained at a healthy level
** These tests helped ensure that the implementation of new features by my teammates can be verified to not break existing features.
* Documentation:
** In charge of team's Documentation.
** Helped standardise the format for both User Guide and Developer Guide
** Helped proof-read the User Guide and Developer Guide and inform teammates of any areas that require changes, with the readability
of the documentation being a top priority.
* Community:
** reviewed PRs (with non-trivial review comments)
** participated actively in discussions with my teammates for their features
