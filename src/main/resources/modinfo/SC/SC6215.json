    "description": "This course investigates the importance of religion in the contemporary world, cross-culturally, relying on the most recent conceptual and methodological frameworks. Despite a focus on the present, a historical perspective is nonetheless necessary to ground analyses of religious phenomena in the contemporary world. The course explores the variety of socio-cultural, political, economic and technological forces and processes that impact the manifold expressions and manifestations of religion and vice-versa. This is facilitated by scrutinizing the `secularisation-sacralisation-resecularisation? debates in the theoretical literature. The emphasis is not only empirical, but also theoretical in drawing together contributions on the subject from a variety of sociological and anthropological perspectives.",
