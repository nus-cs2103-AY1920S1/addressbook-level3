    "description": "Pompeii provides us with a vivid glimpse into the economic, political, and\ncultural life of an ancient Mediterranean city and into that of the Roman\nEmpire at large. The long history of Pompeii closely maps onto the evolution\nof Rome from an Italian city\u2010state into a cosmopolitan world\u2010empire. In this\ncourse, we will discuss the use \u2010 and misuse \u2010 of literary, documentary,\nepigraphic, and archaeological evidence in the practice of pre\u2010modern history. We will cover the high and the low, from taverns, brothels and workshops to\nthe business of wealthy merchants, local politicians and members of the\nimperial family.",
