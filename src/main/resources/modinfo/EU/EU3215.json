    "description": "This course critically examines the key modalities in the evolution of European Economic and Social Institutions from the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire all the way through the rise of Capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. The development of novel property rights, new technologies, altered social relations, demographic change, and transformed political structures, are the principal areas to be studied. A special feature to this evaluation is to contextualise the European achievement in the context of related world history, in particular, its close linkage to non-European societies via the modus of Colonialism.",
