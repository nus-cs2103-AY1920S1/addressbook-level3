    "description": "The module introduces, discusses and evaluates various techniques of design thinking and exploration related to emergent technologies and near future scenarios. Critical and speculative design practices, such as design fiction, action research and various community\u2010based technology and citizen science initiatives reflect upon new technologies through prototyping, storytelling, employing scenarios. They bring a convergence between the philosophical modes of inquiry and design practices serving several functions: from opening a public debate about the social, cultural and ethical impact of emerging and future technologies to exploring alternative futures and involving various actors and stakeholders in the decision making related to various technologies.",
