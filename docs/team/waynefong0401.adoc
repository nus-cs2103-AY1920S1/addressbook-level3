== PROJECT: Billboard

---

== Introduction
This portfolio is meant to document my overall contributions to the CS2103T Software Engineering Project, _Billboard_.

== Overview

In this project, we form a team of five to develop a cross platform financial tracking application _Billboard_.
_Billboard_ is for those who prefer to use desktop applications to manage and keep track of their expenses.
_Billboard_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still enjoying all the benefits of having a fully fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

The following is the UI of Billboard: +

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the feature to undo/redo commands*
** What it does: allows you to undo all previous commands one at a time. The counter command redo can reverse the undone commands.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides a convenient way for to user to
rectify the mistakes made in previous commands.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing and future commands.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required deep copy of existing Billboard.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** added a history command that allows the user to view all the previous commands.
** added a feature that allows the user to to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=waynefong0401[Functional code]]

such as undo/redo, history and up/down navigation, but due to the page limitation, I am only able to show the undo/redo user guide to you.
It showcase my ability to write good documentation for target users.
