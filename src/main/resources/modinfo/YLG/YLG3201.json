    "description": "This course is designed to give students a familiarity with a fuller range of the more complex grammar of ancient Greek, and to give them an opportunity to read in a more focused manner specific examples of non-adapted ancient Greek texts in the original. This course will focus on Greek prose; possible authors may include selections from Herodotus, Lysias, Thucydides, or Plato with appropriate commentaries and secondary literature. As well as gaining a deeper understanding of the syntax, grammar, and the different dialects of ancient Greek, students will develop an increased cultural knowledge in ancient Greek society and historical and philosophical concerns of the period.",
