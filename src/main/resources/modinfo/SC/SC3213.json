    "description": "Explore how anthropologists and sociologists have used visual media such as photography, film and video to conduct ethnographic research and to produce and communicate knowledge about the lives and cultures of the other. We will study their works, both classic and contemporary, to see how they have experimented with the possibilities of visual media while trying to remain consistent with the intellectual demands of their disciplines. Armed with an understanding of the epistemological, methodological, ethical and practical issues involved, students are expected to try their hands at producing visual ethnographies.",
