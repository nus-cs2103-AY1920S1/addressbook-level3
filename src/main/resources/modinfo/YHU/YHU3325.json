    "description": "This course offers an opportunity to explore the mercurial figure of Catiline, the Roman aristocrat infamously implicated into conspiracies to overthrow the Republic between 65-63BC. This exploration is conducted via detailed analysis of a series of literary texts in the original Latin across a 40-year period, with particular attention paid to Cicero\u2019s first speech against Catiline (In Catilinam 1), Sallust\u2019s historiographical narrative in the Bellum Catilinae, and the image of Catiline on Aeneas\u2019 shield in Virgil\u2019s epic Aeneid. Students will be exposed to different literary genres that allow them to chart the development of \u2018Catiline\u2019 in the Roman elite imagination.",
