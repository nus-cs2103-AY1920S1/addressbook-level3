== PROJECT: T.A.rence

I'm Kai Zhe, a student currently pursuing a major in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore(NUS).

== Overview

T.A.rence is a class management system for teaching assistants in NUS. It tracks all classes taught by the TA and all relevant information pertaining to each class,
 such as upcoming events, student participation, assignment scores and the number of hours taught for each module.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major Enhancement*: added *Model skeleton*

==== Created models used in T.A.rence

* Summary of the features:
** Created most of the model classes used in the T.A.rence application (Modules, Tutorials, Students, Assignments, Attendance)

* Justification:
** The models form the backbone of the Application and defines the operations it can perform.

* Highlights:
** Many of the models are interdependent on each other, eg. deleting a Tutorial will also delete all the Students contained within it.
** The interdependence, while useful feature-wise, also leads to high coupling and it was challenging to maintain consistency within
the different models/data structures.

=== *Major Enhancement*: Added ImportTutorialsCommand, Attendance/Assignment/Event-related logic commands

==== Added the ability for the user to import tutorials via an NUSMods shared url, mark/export attendance of students in a tutorial and CRUD features for Assignments and Events.

* Summary of the features:
** Enables the user to record and export students' attendance (Refer to the user guide below)
** Enables the user to track tutorial assignments and students' performance
** Enables the user to keep track of events(both past and upcoming) such as tutorials, exam dates, submission deadlines as well as hours logged for easier payment claims.
** ImportTutorialsCommand makes use of NUSMods data to automatically import modules based on the NUSMods url. It does not require an internet connection.

* Justification:
** Tracking participation, tutorial assignments, upcoming events as well as compatibility with NUSMods
are essential features that cater to any TA in NUS.

* Highlights:
** The user need only define the semester start date for the hours logged in a tutorial to be updated automatically.
The application will determine the dates of completed tutorials from the current date, the semester start date to then calculate the hours logged by the TA.
** The application relies on precached NUSMods data of all existing tutorials in AY 2019-2020, hence it does not rely on a internet connection.
Even then, the loading of the all the data into T.A.rence at initialization is not too computationally/memory intensive, without significant lag.
This is partly because extraneous elements (Lectures, Venues) have been filtered out in the cached data to reduce file size.
** Retrieval of NUSMods tutorials after the initialization is also efficient since the cached data is loaded into a data structure of nested HashMaps that has keys in the following order:
Module code, Semester, Lesson Type(Sectionals, Tutorials, Labs) and finally a unique ClassNo.
** The primary challenge in implementing the importing of tutorials was ensuring the compatibility between the cached data and the Tutorial Class already defined in Application.
This required delving into NUSMods data to understand the general structure of the JSON, as well as reading existing API documentation.

* Credits:
** NUS modules and tutorials data was retrieved from NUSMods database [link:https://api.nusmods.com/v2/2019-2020/[NUSMods]]

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added ability for the user to enter multiple commands separated by the "+" delimiter in a single input (eg. command1 + command2 + command3)
