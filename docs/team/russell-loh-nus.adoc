== Project Title: Njoy Teaching Assistant

---

=== Overview

*Njoy Teaching Assistant* is a command line interface(CLI) desktop application built by a team for 5 computing students for our Software Engineering project.
It enables teachers of various disciplines to create a more interactive classroom through the use of slideshow and polling. Outside the classroom, it
allows them to manage their classes, timetables, notes, questions and quizzes.

Below is an example image of the application:

I was tasked to brainstorm a solution that could enhance classroom learning and implement it. Eventually, I came up with the solution of using question prompts through
a slideshow that is able to facilitate discussions in the classroom and at the same time, allow teachers to manage these questions more efficiently.
The following sections includes my contribution to the project and selected key snippets of documentation that I wrote pertaining to my features for both the user and developer guides.

Certain special formatting are used in this document and their description is as follows:

|==============================
| Format | Description

| `command` | Indicates a command, keyword or control for the user guide. For the developer guide, it indicates that it is a class, method or variable name.
| `https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-2/main[command]` | Indicates a link to a section in the document or to a web page.

=== Summary of contributions

This section describes the various enhancements that I have contributed to the project which includes coding, documentation, project management and design.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability for teachers to manage their questions.
** *What it does:* Allows teachers to manage their questions more efficiently by providing a simple interface to create, edit, delete and find questions.
** *Justification:* With teachers having to constantly prepare their questions before lessons and organise their questions for quizzes or homework, this feature will help to cut down
the preparation time needed for such tasks.
** *Highlights:* This enhancement is the basis for both the slideshow and quiz features and required an in-depth analysis on how teachers will use this feature, and how the questions can be presented in a simple yet intuitive manner.
Moreover, it was challenging to adjust this feature such that it can be easily reused by both the slideshow and quiz features as they rely heavily on these questions.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability for teachers to start a slideshow
** *What it does:* Allows teachers to start an in-class activity with their students through a slideshow of questions that has an additional polling feature to garner responses from students.
** *Justification:* Slideshow reduces the need for teachers to constantly write questions on the whiteboard and at the same time, interact with students through the use of polling to
question their understanding about a topic before revealing the answer.
** *Highlights:* This enhancement adds additional purpose to existing questions and required an in-depth analysis on how typical presentation software works so that using the slideshow feature will not feel foreign to the teachers.
It was challenging to ensure that the controls are familiar to the teachers and the layout is simple enough for the students to view.

* *Minor enhancement 1*: Restyled the general application interface.
* *Minor enhancement 2*: Designed the *Njoy* logo and banner.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Russell-Loh-NUS&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-2%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Functional and test code]]
