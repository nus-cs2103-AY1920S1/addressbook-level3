    "description": "From the earliest films in the late 19th century to contemporary Hollywood blockbusters, science and technology have long played a role in how the future has been envisioned. In this seminar students will study a range of popular science fiction films and examine how the futures portrayed in these films are a creative, ociocultural response to the techno\u2010scientific milieu of their production. Students will consider how film challenges us to re\u2010examine concepts of scientific progress and technological advancement by asking questions such as: what is monstrous about sci\u2010fi monsters, and what is biology in the age of the machine?",
