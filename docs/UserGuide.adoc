== Introduction

This CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for storing test banks*.
More importantly, RT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, RT can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional
GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that you have the latest version of JavaFX installed in your Computer. (Previous versions of JavaFX may cause
bugs related to displaying pop ups. more info about this bug can be found at this link:{javaFxBugURL}/link[link])
.  Download the latest RT link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `*test bank*`.
