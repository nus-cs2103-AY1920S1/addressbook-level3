    "description": "This module introduces the elements of computational thinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the environment and food science. These elements include problem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition, decomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct application of these elements will occur through programming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi computer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make real-time observations of phenomena relevant to the environment and/or food science.",
