    "description": "The formation, distribution and preservation or destruction of oil and natural gas resources are governed by geologic histories of basins. Good understanding of geological principles and aspects of petroleum geoscience, therefore founds the basis for successful exploration, development and production in the petroleum industry. This course aims to provide students with a knowledgebase to understand the (1) fundamental principles of geology and its use for sedimentary basins studies. (2) nature and origin of petroleum and the methods for characterizing and evaluating hydrocarbon basins and prospects (3) direct experience of studying sedimentary rocks in an oilfield. This module also serves as an introduction to oil & gas drilling and completion process. Starting from a typical Drill Rig and its major systems, to the process of drilling onshore and offshore, to casing & cementing, through to well completion.",
