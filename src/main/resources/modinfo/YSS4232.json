    "description": "This module will challenge advanced students to connect the three\nmain threads of the PPE major: politics, philosophy, and economics. To\ndo so, we will analyse the historical development and the legitimacy of\nthe Welfare State, which rose to predominance in the twentieth\ncentury. To understand its future, we will examine the myriad of\nchallenges facing it today, including economic crises and interstate\norganizations. We will also consider how questions arising from the\nWelfare State bear on other values, especially democracy and the rule\nof law.",
