== Overview

CS ModBuddy is an module-planning application designed for primarily first-year computer science undergraduates in NUS.
Users may create study plans where they can add and remove modules from various semesters, tag these modules to
personalize their study plan, and check if they meet graduation requirements.

This application is written in Java, and morphed from AddressBook-3.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *description of modules*

** What it does: given a module code, users can retrieve a description of the entire module, including
its focus areas, S/U-ability, prerequisites, and more. Users may also list all core or focus area modules that
can be taken.

** Justification: this feature allows users to easily refer to information on various modules, which facilitates
module planning and helps them decide whether or not to include them in their study plans.

** Highlights: it required the creation of a comprehensive JSON file detailing module requirements, prerequisites, and all other
module-related information, which forms the backbone of all modules created in our application.

** Credits: The information for computer science modules was sourced from https://nusmods.com[NUSMods].

* *Major enhancement*: added the *checking of module prerequisites and study plan requirements*

** What it does: searches for and highlights modules whose prerequisites are not satisfied in the user's study plan.
It also checks the study plan for overall graduation requirements, such as focus area requirements,
core module requirements, and total MC count.

** Justification: this feature allows the user to create a legitimate study plan that satisfies the given requirements,
so that the resulting study plan allows the student to graduate.

** Highlights: to check for a module's prerequisites, they need to be parsed into trees (involving AND or OR structures)
that are checked against every time the user makes adjustments to their study plan.

** Credits: The information on overall graduation requirements was sourced from the https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[NUS Computing website].

* *Minor enhancements*:

*** Added a command to clear all invalid modules in a study plan, whose prerequisites have not been met.
*** Added a command to view all valid modules that can be taken in a given semester. This helps the user to
decide what modules he or she may take next.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=halfwhole&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Functional and Test Code]]
