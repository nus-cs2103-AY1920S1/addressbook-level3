The science of drug action (pharmacology) will include two major areas of pharmacology, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, which provide the scientific foundation for the study of drug actions. In dealing with the therapeutic applications of drug actions, examples of commonly used drugs for specific disease states will be discussed, and their possible side-effects highlighted. The examples will illustrate the use of over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs.",
