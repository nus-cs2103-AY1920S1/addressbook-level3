    "description": "Game theory has been at the core of much of the contemporary research in economics. The importance of the subject arises from the pervasiveness of the assumption of rational behavior in many human sciences. Applications of game theory have arisen in many fields of economics, such as industrial organization, international economics, labor, finance, and political science. This module is designed to present the main ideas and methods of game theory at graduate level, emphasizing on its theoretical foundations and practical implications.",
