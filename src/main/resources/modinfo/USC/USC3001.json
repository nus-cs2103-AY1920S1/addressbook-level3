    "description": "To enable the student in obtaining a global perspective of diverse interesting complex systems in the biological, physical and social sciences by introducing some of the common concepts (e.g. emergent laws, entropy, dissipative structures, fractals), principles (e.g. universality, criticality) and tools (e.g. statistical mechanics, simple models and computer simulations) used for their study. That is, the emphasis will be more on studying and characterizing generic features of different systems rather than a detailed study and solution of any particular system. In this regard, the importance and value of simple models, the robustness of the theoretical modeling data and its comparison with controlled experiments will be emphasized. However, it is equally important to distinguish those modeling efforts and controlled experiments from the fundamental underlying theory and data from natural systems. In other words, one must be made aware of the difference between qualitative and quantitative understanding, and between plausible arguments and rigorous proof.
