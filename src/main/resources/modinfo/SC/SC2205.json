    "description": "This course focuses on theories of family and social change, by examining perspectives on families, drawing on literature from history, anthropology, sociology, and demography. Questions addressed include: What is a family? What is the relationship between family and household structure and economic, political, and cultural change both historically and in contemporary time? How do couples allocate their time and money in relationships? How do families vary by social class and race/ethnicity? How have attitudes, expectations, and behaviors surrounding childbearing and childrearing changed? Theoretical perspectives on the family are supplemented with case studies of change and variation in families and households.",
