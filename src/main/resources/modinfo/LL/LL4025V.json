    "description": "An advanced course in analytic jurisprudence, investigating the nature of rights. It begins with exposition of Wesley Hohfeld\u2019s analysis of the different legal positions often designated as 'rights'; then uses Hohfeld\u2019s framework to understand the debate between interest and will theorists of rights. It moves on to explicit consideration of moral rights. Finally, applications are considered - including human rights, and Asian perspectives on 'rights' discourse.",
