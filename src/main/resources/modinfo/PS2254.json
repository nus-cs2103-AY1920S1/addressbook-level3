    "description": "The American system has been viewed as a model for\n\ncountries around the world and, more recently, a lesson\n\nin the dangers of extreme individualism and\n\nirresponsible government. This module examines\n\npolitical institutions and practices in the United States,\n\nincluding the Constitution, the Presidency, Congress,\n\nand Judiciary, the federal system, the party system, and\n\npresidential and congressional elections. Because it has\n\nbeen intensively studied, the American political system\n\nprovides a good introduction to the study of political\n\nscience.",
