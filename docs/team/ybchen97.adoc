== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *Bin Feature*
** What it does: Added a bin to store all deleted items. When deleting either persons or policies, instead of being
removed permanently, deleted items are shifted to the bin instead. Just like a recycling bin on a typical computer, items
inside the bin can be restored as long as they have not exceeded their expiry date.
** Justification: This allows for the user to restore persons or policies that could have been wrongly deleted in
previous sessions. Additionally, this is also useful in the case when the user wants to restore an item that was
deleted at the start of the session, where it is too troublesome to undo cleanly.
** Highlights:
*** The bin is persistent across different sessions. Its items are saved into a json file, as with persons and policies.
*** Once the deleted items have exceeded their expiry date, they will be automatically deleted on restart of the
application.
*** The amount of time an item stays in the bin before it is deleted can be set by the user as a user setting,
through the command `binitemexpiry`. This is a global setting and applies for all items in the bin.

* *Minor enhancement*:
*** Redesigned User Interface to give a cleaner, sleek look. [Pull Request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-4/main/pull/209[#209]]
