== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event more efficiently
and in an organized fashion. Currently, organising a Hackathon is no mean feat, as it requires coordinating
across different stakeholders and managing different sources of data (such as participant and mentor information).
Instead of managing this process across different media such as Excel spreadsheets and emails, Alfred allows
you to coordinate everything in a single, convenient-to-use platform.

In particular, Alfred is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This means that users are expected
to interact with Alfred mainly through the Command Line, but each command executed will invoke a visual response
in Alfred.

Any help on the development of Alfred would be greatly appreciated,
and there are a couple of ways for you to do so
- Contribute to Alfred's codebase by expanding its features
- Improve test coverage
- Propose and implement improvements to current features.

This guide seeks to not only kick-start your journey as a contributor to Alfred by quickly getting you
up to speed with how Alfred's codebase and inner workings function, but also hopes to serve as
a useful reference to current contributors in times or confusion or when faced with difficulties.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
Alfred was designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in mind, with a focus on respecting
the SOLID principles. This section serves to give a description of the major components in the architecture
of Alfred. Subsequent sections will provide a lot more information on the inner workings of individual components
and how different components interact with each other for Alfred's various features.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

`LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component

[NOTE]
UI image and description to be updated with the later milestones.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]
The UI consist of a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] that is made up of different parts like link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter.`] , link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] and more. All these including link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindo`] , inherit from the abstract link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UiPart.java[`UiPart`] class.

The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntityListPanel.java[`EntityListPanel`] consist of any number link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntityCard.java[`EntityCard`] (which also inherits from the abstract UiPart class). The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntityCard.java[`EntityCard`]  will dynamically generate cards of different entity type according to the data provided by Model, hence it will have a soft dependency on Model.
The UI component uses JavaFX UI framework, with the support of third party libraries JFeonix and FontAwesomeFX. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching .fxml files that are in the src/main/resources/view folder. For example, the layout of the MainWindow is specified in MainWindow.fxml.
The UI component,
•  Executes user commands using the Logic component.
•  Listens for changes to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic`] component.
* Looks at the prefix commandType given in the CommandResult(returned after every Command is executed), as displays the specific link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntityListPanel.java[`EntityListPanel`] respectively.

==== Design Considerations
These are some design considerations for the UI component.

===== Aspect: Ways to update different entity list
* Alternative 1: The system collects information form Model after each command, to display the entity list as the command result.
** Pros: Easy to implement with existing Model interface
** Cons: High degree of dependency between UI components and Model components(high coupling).
** Cons: Updating of the data is not automatic.
* Alternative 2: The system uses and Observable interface that observes for changes in the three types of list, namely ParticipantList, TeamList and MentorList.
** Pros: Low degree of dependency between UI and Model components(low coupling).
** Pros: The data in GUI is automatically updated.
** Cons: Harder to implement

Decision: We have decided to go with alternative  2 because low dependency will ensure testability and maintainability of the system.

===== Aspect: How to generate EntityCard and ListPanel to display different entities
* Alternative 1: Implement different classes that inherits EntityCard, like TeamCard, ParticipantCard and MentorCard respectively. Additionaly, implement different classes that extents ListPanel, like TeamListPanel and more.
** Pros: Easy to implement and style respective cards and list panels.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated many times, one for each type of entity. For example, ParticipantCard and Mentorcard are similar for most fields, except the extra field of Organisation and Specialisation.
** Cons:  Clutters the system with extra classes.

* Alternative 2: Implement a EntityCard class with a barebone structure. Then dynamically add and morph the fields in Entity card according to the entity type.
**	Pros: No duplication of the same logic and implementation, as abstraction was used.
** Pros: Lesser class files required.
**	Cons: Harder to implement.

Decision: We have decided to proceed with alternative 2 because this alternative employs that theory of abstraction in programming, and it there is less redundant code in this implementation.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component of Alfred handles the various commands within Alfred and
the parsing of the user input to convert them into such commands.
It's primary purpose is to execute these commands which leads to an update in `Model`
(depending on the command) and return an appropriate feedback message to the UI component to
display to the user. It does this through a set of allocators, parsers and commands.

Allocators are relevant for commands which involve a specific entity, such as `find participant`. The
allocator will allocate the appropriate `FindParticipantCommandParser` to parse the input. If the input
is valid, parsers will then generate a command object to be returned. This command object is then
executed in `LogicManager`. However, `Logic` does not concern itself with the details of the execution.
That is abstracted away via polymorphism and delegated to `Model`. Executing a command then returns
a `CommandResult` object, which will then be processed to conclude the command execution flow.

If any errors are encountered along the way, an error is thrown and the flow terminates.

The `Logic` component's primary structure is unchanged from the AB3 codebase,
though it has been heavily modified to accommodate the new commands implemented with regards to
Alfred, as can be seen from the class diagram below which highlights the high level structure
of the logic component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AlfredParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This can result in one of two possibilities:
* a new `CommandAllocator` object is created to allocate the user input to appropriate entity-specific `Parser`. The `CommandAllocator` 's `allocate` method then returns a new Command object which is executed by the LogicManager, or
* the appropriate `Parser` is directly called if no specifying is required and returns a new  `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a participant or deleting a team).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete participant P-1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteParticipantCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandAllocator` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

==== High Level Design Overview

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores other things like `Storage`, `CommandHistory` that also depend on `Model`
* stores the lists of our various entities.
* `Model` is the bridge between `Logic` and `Storage` and provides an abstraction of how the data is stored in memory.
* It exposes multiple `ReadableEntityList` which only has the list method to remind `Logic` that the data given should not be modified.
* The UI can be bound to these lists so that it automatically updates when the contents of the list change.
* At the heart of the `Model` are observable lists which allow for the dynamic updating of the UI.
* The `Model` interface also serves as an API through which controller can edit the data stored in memory.

`ModelManager`

* `ModelManager` implements all the methods exposed by the `Model` interface. The 3 most important aspects for its in-memory
storage and UI are the `FilteredList`, `EntityList` and `UserPrefs` objects. As mentioned above, `ModelManager` also
consists of other components, but these are not reflected in the diagrams for brevity and clarity.

.Simple Illustration of ModelManager
image::ModelManagerClassDiagram.png[]

.EntityList simplified structure
image::EntityListClassDiagram.png[]

Each `EntityList` is also further subclassed into `ParticipantList`, `MentorList`, `TeamList`. Each of
these lists can be seen as an individual address book from the original AB3 project. The following diagrams show
the structure of these `Entity` objects within each list. These `Entity` objects are the building blocks of Alfred.

.Participant
image::ParticipantClassDiagram.png[]

.Team
image::TeamClassDiagram.png[]

.Mentor
image::MentorClassDiagram.png[]

==== Usage

When the ModelManager object is first created upon starting the application, the existing data is loaded from
the disc via methods on the `Storage` object. However, if there are any bugs in the process, perhaps due
to corrupted data, a new `EntityList` is instantiated rather than run the risk of working with outdated data.

Due to its role as the API of the application, all calls which require access to the `Entity` objects will be done
through `Model` and not via the lists directly. These operations are listed as public methods on the `Model` interface.

For operations which would entail mutating the data within the
`EntityList` objects in any form, `Model` automatically communicates with the `Storage` object to save the data.
The saving logic can be found within the `Storage` object and thus `Model` only needs to pass it `EntityList` objects
on its end. The same applies for the other attributes in `Model`, such as `CommandHistory`; `ModelManager` will
automatically communicate with it for you.

If there are any errors along the way, it will be logged but the error would be handled within `Model` itself.
Moreover, if there is an error during a `Model` operation, the data will not be saved to disc.

==== Design Considerations

These are some design considerations for Model.

===== Aspect: Synchronization of data
    * The role of `ModelManager` is to ensure that the data is in sync with each other across all 3 `EntityList`
objects. The reason behind this is because for example, the `Participant` object in `ParticipantList` is a separate
object from the one inside `Team`. It was not possible due to make the `Participant` object hold a reference
to `Team` due to serialization issues on `Storage`.
    * As such, for each CRUD operation, `ModelManager` has to perform validation to ensure that the data modified/added
is sync across all 3 `EntityList` objects.
    * This was also the reason why `Storage` was moved into the `Model` object, as in the current implementation of
Alfred, only `ModelManager` needs to communicate with `Storage`. This would
hence help to better ensure data integrity.

===== Aspect: Single Responsibility Principle and Inheritance
    * Each class in `Model` is only responsible for a single task. For example, `TeamList` is only concerned
with managing the `Team` entities stored in it. This would help to improve testability and code quality, especially
since the size of the `Model` codebase is substantial.
    * Inheritance was used to show links between related objects. For `Model`, the two objects whose subclasses are related
are
`EntityList` and `Entity`. Inheritance was used to show this relationship and to reduce the need for code
duplication.

===== Aspect: Open Closed Principle
    * `Model` exposes many functions. However, in line with the Open Closed Principle, modifications to `Model`
come in the form of exposing new methods on it and creating new attributes on the `ModelManager` object. The methods
on `ModelManager` were also implemented as simply as possible so that future methods can build on them. This way,
future modifications do not need to edit existing code, reducing the likelihood of regression bugs.

===== Aspect: Design of the `Entity` objects
* *Alternative 1*: Make the `Team` object the single source of truth (only `Team` has references to `Participant`
and `Mentor`)
    - Pros: This would facilitate the serialization on `Storage`
    - Cons: As `Participant` and `Mentor` objects no longer hold a reference to the `Team` object,
it is now possible for their fields to be different from their counterparts stored in `Team`, requiring
Alfred to do significant validation
* *Alternative 2*: Make `Participant`, `Mentor` and `Team` objects store a bidirectional reference to each other
    - Pros: The `Participant` objects in the `Team` 's participants field are exactly the same objects stored in the
`ParticipantList`, reducing the need for validation code as they will never be out of sync
    - Cons: `Storage` serialization cannot handle bidirectional associations

We decided to opt for Alternative 1 as there was no easy solution to solve the issues `Storage` had with
bidirectional associations. Also, the validation code for Alternative 1 was implemented early and employed
many defensive programming practices, reducing the likelihood of bugs affecting data integrity.

==== Future Extensions
1. As the single source of truth for the application in runtime, there are many small functions on `ModelManager` now.
These functions are implemented directly in the file itself. In the future, it may be better to abstract these
functions out into smaller modules as per the Dependency Inversion Principle. It was not done for v1 of Alfred
as refactoring these methods would block developers and slow down feature development velocity. However,
as Alfred scales, it is recommended that this refactoring be done.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The Storage component handles the complexities of storing to and reading from disc the Alfred's data.
The Storage component transforms the AB3 implementation to support the storage of Alfred's 3
main EntityLists (ParticipantList, MentorList and TeamList) as well as User Preferences. The 3 EntityLists are the main data objects
in Alfred, and Storage's purpose is to transform each of the EntityLists into a format that is JSON-Serializable
and store the data for each EntityList in separate JSON files. Storage also saves the User Preferences in a JSON file.

[NOTE]
The Food- and Swag-related features scheduled for release in v2.0, will require some changes in Storage to be made.
To be more specific, Storage would need to be updated to support the storage of these other essential data, above and beyond the
current support for the storage of the EntityLists.

//tag::storageDG[]
==== Purpose and Usage of Storage Component
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::AlfredStorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AlfredStorage.java[`AlfredStorage.java`]

The `Storage` component saves and reads 4 different *_data types_*:

1. `UserPrefs`: User Preferences for Alfred (such as the last used Window Size of the application)
2. `ParticipantList`: Information of all the Participants in Alfred
3. `MentorList`: Information of all the Mentors in Alfred
4. `TeamList`: Information of all the Teams in Alfred

All 4 data types are stored to disc in JSON files. The data is read from the JSON files when Alfred is first
start up. It is also important to note that saving is automatic in Alfred. This means that after the execution of each
command, the data in Alfred will automatically be saved to disk. This frees the user from the hassle of constantly calling
some form of saving functionality, and ensures that the information in storage is as up-to-date as possible.

[NOTE]
When reading the JSON files from memory at application start-up, any kind of data corruption in the JSON files
will cause Alfred to completely discard the file and re-initialise the data type. If there are missing fields
in the JSON file, invalid values in the individual fields or any kind of error while reading the data from the JSON
file, Alfred will re-initialise the data type with an empty data type, persisting this newly initialised data type object
to disc.

==== Interacting with the Storage Component

The Storage Component uses the Facade Design Pattern, and exposes the functionality of all the Storage classes
to the Model Component solely through the AlfredStorage interface. The exposed functionality was deliberately kept
simple, allowing the following methods for each of the 4 data types:

    1. `getFilePath()`: Retrieves the location of the JSON file
    2. `save()`: saves the data to the JSON file
    3. `read()`: reads the data from the JSON file

The Storage component handles the complexities of actually storing to and reading from disc the 4 different data types.
As can be seen in the figure at the start of this section, underlying AlfredStorage's simple interface are several classes
that ensure the accurate storing and retrieval of Alfred's data from disc. The following are some details of the Storage
Component:

* Each EntityList has a designated Storage class (i.e. for Participant, you have `ParticipantListStorage`, `JsonParticipantListStorage` etc.). Hence, for the rest of this explanation, Entity will be used as a generic term for Participants/Mentors/Teams.
* The class implementing the `EntityListStorage` interface is `JsonEntityListStorage`. This class is responsible for providing the read/save functionality for the entire EntityList to `AlfredStorageManager`.
* In order to save the entire `EntityList` in JSON, the class `JsonSerializableEntityList` implements the logic for serialization for the collection of Entities (i.e. EntityList). This is achieved by converting the `EntityList` to a `List<JsonAdaptedEntity>`.
* In order to save each individual Entity, the Entity is in turn converted to a `JsonAdaptedEntity` object. The `JsonAdaptedEntity` class contains the fields of each Entity that are relevant for saving to disc. Hence, this class is directly serialized into JSON, and also has methods for converting the serialized object back into an Entity object for `AlfredStorage` to return to `ModelManager`.
* The conversion of the `JsonAdaptedEntity` object to fields in a JSON file is done by Java's Jackson library.

The following is a concrete example of the storage of a ParticipantList in JSON:

.Structure of the JSON File for ParticipantList
image::ParticipantListJson.png[]

The figure above shows the contents of the JSON file storing a ParticipantList containing 2 participants. The data in the red box
corresponds to the fields in a single Participant object. These fields are generated by the Jackson library from the serializable `JsonAdaptedParticipant`
object, and the entire list of participants in the JSON file is in turn generated because the `JsonSerializableParticipantList` class converts
the ParticipantList to a List of `JsonAdaptedParticipant`.

==== Design Considerations
The following are some design considerations for the Storage component.

===== Aspect: Data Integrity

* The individual `JsonAdaptedEntity` classes perform validation on every field in the JSON file for each Entity as
it attempts to convert the JSON data into an Entity in Alfred. Should the data prove to be invalid, an error is thrown
upwards to ModelManager and a new EntityList is initialised in memory, effectively discarding the old EntityList.
* This design was to ensure that any form of tampering of the code, malicious or inadvertent, will not result in data
inconsistencies in Alfred.
* In future implementations, it would be best to ensure that the JSON file is encrypted and secured to minimise
opportunities for tampering with the data.

===== Aspect: Single Responsibility Principle

* Each class exists for a very specific purpose. A class is provided for each Entity.
* Purpose (From Top-Down):
** Exposing read/save functionality for EntityList: `JsonEntityListStorage`
** Serializing EntityList: `JsonSerializableEntityList`
** Serializing one Entity: `JsonAdaptedEntity`

===== Aspect: Interface Segregation

* Each interface is kept as minimal as possible and targets a specific Entity type.
* AlfredStorage is an interface that extends multiple interfaces to expose the read/save functionality
required by Model.

===== Aspect: Dependency Inversion

* Alfred's Model is dependent on the interface AlfredStorage, and the implementation is provided through AlfredStorageManager.
Hence, all functionality provided are first stipulated in the AlfredStorage interface.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation


To best address the numerous and varying needs of Hackathon organizers, we have packed Alfred with a multitude of different features, each of which seeks to provide the user with the optimal means of tending to their hackathon organising needs. However, with a host of features comes a sizable codebase which can make it daunting for new programmers, and often even veteran Alfred programmers, to understand how certain features have been implemented. This section aims to empower you by introducing you to some of the noteworthy features currently present within Alfred, along with few that hope to add in the future, so that you may better grasp the implementation of these features in a bid to contribute new features and improvements to existing features within Alfred. Despite our best efforts to make the explanations of Alfred's features' as comprehensive as possible, we do advice not to solely rely on this guide for understanding and encourage you to experiment with each feature's code in order to truly grasp it.

// tag::ImportExportA[]
[[BulkRegistration]]
=== Bulk Registration

The Bulk Registration feature, referred as the import command, allows you to add multiple entities into Alfred at once through a CSV file. The file must be stored locally as Alfred will attempt to retrieve it through the file path provided by the user. In order for the import command to successfully execute, it is required that the CSV file is formatted according to Alfred's requirements, which you can read more about in our <<UserGuide#ParameterConstraints, user guide>>.

This feature will be explained further in the following subsections.

==== Implementation Overview

Since this feature manages data from a CSV file, import command relies on the `CsvUtil` class. The `CsvUtil` class handles reading from and writing data to a CSV file. Below shows the relationships between different classes in Alfred.

[[ImportCommandClassDiagram]]
.Import Command Class Diagram
image::ImportCommandClassDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70%, align="center"]

In the above class diagram, you can see that

[none]
* 1. The `ImportCommand` uses the `FileUtil` class, and this is so for a number of reasons. First is to validate whether user inputted file path is, in fact, a valid file path. Once it is verified, another check is done to see if the file exists at the given file path. If the file is not able to be located, the `ImportCommand` will not complete its execution.

* 2. In addition to the `CsvUtil` class, the `ImportCommand` also utilizes an `ErrorTracker` class. This class will store any lines in the CSV file that is invalid along with the reason why it is so. Each `Error` object referenced by the `ErrorTracker` will correspond to one line in the CSV file and the cause of the error.

The activity diagram below will explain the overall flow of `ImportCommand`.

[[ImportCommandActivityDiagram]]
.Import Command Activity Diagram
image::ImportCommandActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70%, align="center"]

In the above diagram, you can see that teams are buffered for later use, which the reason is explained <<Implementation: `ImportCommand`, below>>. Also, *node A*, located right before the end, will be discussed in <<Implementation: Outputting Error File, this section>>. Now, the sections below will give a detailed explanation of different portions of this feature.

==== Implementation: `ImportCommand`

Once a valid user input is parsed and passed into the `ImportCommand`, the command will open the file and read its content line by line. Each line is then parsed into the corresponding entity by the `CsvUtil` class. This will be explained further <<Implementation: Parsing of Entities by `CsvUtil`, below>>. The following sequence diagram shows the steps involved in mass importing data into Alfred.

.Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[pdfwidth=80%, align="center"]

`FileUtil` shown in the <<ImportCommandClassDiagram, class diagram>> was omitted from the above sequence diagram for simplicity as it adds little to the overall flow of execution.

As the above figure shows, the file path from the user input is extracted and passed as a field for `ImportCommand`. Then, Alfred proceeds to convert file content into relevant entities.

When `ImportCommand` parses and adds entities to `Model`, it is crucial that teams are the last entities to be added. In the above sequence diagram, this process of buffering teams was also omitted for simplicity. Basically, in the `#parseLineToEntity()` method, if a line in CSV file corresponds to a team, the line will be buffered to be parsed after all the other lines have been parsed. The reason for this is because teams may have dependencies on other participants and mentors. It is required that all of the participants and mentors associated with a team, say Team A, exist inside the `Model` before Team A can be added.

So as `ImportCommand` accesses the CSV file line by line, the line representing a team will be stored in a `Queue<String>` for later use. When the end of file is reached and all other participants and mentors are parsed and added to `Model`, the `ImportCommand` will poll from the `Queue`, parse into a relevant team, and add it to the `Model` until the `Queue` is empty.

// end::ImportExportA[]

==== Implementation: Parsing of Entities by `CsvUtil`

As mentioned before, the `CsvUtil` class is used to aid in parsing of CSV lines into entities. The process in which `CsvUtil` parses each entity is heavily dependent on the different fields each entity has. If you are not familiar with this yet, please check out our <<UserGuide.adoc#ParameterConstraints, user guide>>.

The process of parsing a line into a mentor or a participant is very similar, so two entities - participant and team - will be explained.

First, the following is a sequence diagram for parsing a CSV line into a participant. The line to be parsed is `"P,ID,Bruce Wayne,12345678,\wbruce@wayne.ent"`.

.`CsvUtil`: Parsing to Participant Sequence Diagram
image::CsvUtilParseParticipantSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given CSV line is first split by commas (also allows commas surrounded by arbitrary number of spaces). Then, each `String` in the array is (attempted to be) converted into corresponding fields of a Participant. As the diagram shows, each field class has its own method for checking if the given `String` argument is valid - in the form of `#isValidField()` method, where `Field` is replaced by its respective class name. Once each field is successfully converted, a Participant is created with the parsed fields. The process of parsing into a Mentor is practically equivalent of that of a Participant. The only change is in the fields being parsed.

Next is a sequence diagram for parsing a CSV line into a team. The line to be parsed is `"T,,Justice League,[P-1|P-2],M-1,Social,100,Save the Earth,1"`.

.`CsvUtil`: Parsing to Team Sequence Diagram
image::CsvUtilParseTeamSequenceDiagram.png[]

Also for teams, each corresponding `String` is converted to its field counterpart just like participants and mentors. Hence, `#isValidField()` method was omitted from the diagram. The difference lies in the fact that for teams, Alfred must check if any participants or mentors it makes a reference to actually exists in `Model`. Thus, `CsvUtil` calls `Model#getParticipant()` and `Model#getMentor()` methods exposed by the `Model` class. If there are any exceptions raised while retrieving the participants and mentors, that line in CSV will not be loaded onto Alfred.

==== Implementation: Outputting Error File

Other than the CSV file path, if the user specifies an additional file path, Alfred will create a new CSV file path at that location containing every line in the user-given CSV file that had an error. For example, if lines 4, 6, and 7 were invalid in the imported CSV file, the error CSV file will contain only three lines, namely lines 4, 6, and 7 of the user-given CSV file.

The activity diagram below will illustrate what would happen if two file paths were provided. The following diagram starts at *node A* shown in <<ImportCommandActivityDiagram>>.

.Import Command Error File Path Provided
image::ImportCommandErrorFileActivityDiagram.png[]

[[ImportCommandDesignConsiderations]]
// tag::ImportExportB[]
==== Design Considerations

When designing this feature, different aspects - list below - were considered.

===== Aspect: Storing of File Path

* *Alternative 1:* Store as a `String`

** Cons: May have cross-platform issues.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Store as a `Path`

** Pros: Fixes cross-platform issues (by handling all possible separator characters used by different OS's)

Alternative 2 was chosen because of the additional benefits `Path` class provides. Additional overhead of `Path` class (`File` class could also have been used) proved more effective than storing as `Strings`.

===== Aspect: Representation of an Invalid Line in CSV File

* *Alternative 1:* Represent as a `String` and print to user

** Pros: Gets the message across. The user will know the content of the line that is causing the problem.
** Pros: Simple to manage.
** Cons: The user will have to locate where the line is in the CSV file.
** Cons: The user will not know why the line causes a problem.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Create an `Error` wrapper class

** Pros: Able to store line number, content of line, and cause of error in one object.
** Pros: Makes sorting of multiple `Error` objects easier through a `#compareTo()` method. This proves useful when a buffered line (representing a team) contains error.
** Pros: Able to display multiple information to user in a neat fashion.

We chose Alternative 2 because `Error` class will be able to provide a more detailed explanation more simply than using a `String`. By displaying to the user the line number and the reason why the line was not able to be imported into Alfred would save user tons of time trying to locate where the line is in the CSV file and why it caused a problem. However, we figured that knowing the line number would not help much in locating the line in the CSV file if the file is huge, hence the next aspect.

===== Aspect: Display of Errors

* *Alternative 1:* Display to user through `CommandResult` box of the GUI

** Pros: Gets its job done.
** Cons: May overcrowd the `CommandResult` box for a big CSV file with lots of errors.

* *Alternative 2:* Creates a new CSV file containing all the errors.

** Pros: Provides a 'clean slate' for the user to correct their errors.
** Pros: The user does not have to locate the lines in their original CSV file.
** Cons: The user will not know the reason why certain line caused an error.
** Cons: May be a bit overkill, especially if only one or two lines were invalid.

This aspect has no *(Current Choice)* attached to any alternative because Alfred utilizes both. As mentioned before, Alternative 2 will be carried out if the user specifies an error file path. Then, whether or not the user has provided the error file path, Alfred will still include an error message in the `CommandResult` box if there are any.

===== Aspect: Assigning of Participants and/or Mentor to Teams through `ImportCommand`

* *Alternative 1:* Do not allow assigning to Teams through `ImportCommand`

** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Pros: Placement of lines in CSV file will not cause problems while adding to Alfred.
** Cons: Defeats the purpose of "bulk registration" if the user has to go through a 2-step process just to add one team.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Allow assigning

** Pros: The user does not have to go through an n-step process to add multiple teams.
** Cons: Relatively difficult to implement. Have to take care of dependency issues between participants/mentors and teams.

Initially, our plan was to disallow users from assigning other entities to Teams through `ImportCommand`. However, we soon realized that a huge purpose of Alfred and this feature was to facilitate managing of relationships between Teams and other entities. So, we decided to allow assignment by buffering parsing of Teams to a later stage - after all the other participants and mentors have been parsed and added into Alfred.

// end::ImportExportB[]

=== Export Feature

The export feature will be used to unload the data in Alfred to an external CSV file. This functionality will prove useful when the user wishes to share the aggregate data of a particular hackathon event with other people/organizations or wishes to keep a record of past hackathons for future references.

The user can choose to either export all the data regarding a specific entity or all entities by specifying the entity when typing the command. Through the following sections, implementation of the `ExportCommand` will be explained in detail.

==== Implementation Overview

This feature, like `ImportCommand`, utilizes the `CsvUtil` class because it also handles CSV files. As mentioned before, on top of parsing of data, `CsvUtil` also supports writing of different entities into a provided CSV file by converting them to their corresponding CSV Strings. Below shows the relationships between different classes involved in `ExportCommand`.

.Export Command Class Diagram
image::ExportCommandClassDiagram.png[]

The diagram shows that much like `ImportCommand`, `ExportCommand` also utilizes utility classes, such as `CsvUtil` and `FileUtil`. However, unlike `ImportCommand`, since Alfred is the one creating the file this time, if the file path given by the user is not a valid path, Alfred will create and export all data to a file located at default file path, which is `./AlfredData/Alfred_Data.csv`.

The activity diagram below will show in more detail how the `ExportCommand` is executed.

[[ExportCommandActivityDiagram]]
.Export Command Activity Diagram
image::ExportCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation: `ExportCommand`

The <<ExportCommandActivityDiagram, above>> diagram illustrated the general flow of how `ExportCommand` is executed. You can see that majority of the work is being passed onto the `CsvUtil`. The sequence diagram below will show how `CsvUtil` manages to write all the data into a CSV file.

.Export Command Sequence Diagram
image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

You can see that `CsvUtil` receives the `EntityList` of each entity type from `Model`. `CsvUtil` will then iterate through one entity at a time, convert to corresponding CSV String, and write to the CSV file. As such, you can see that the actual writing to a CSV file is handled by `CsvUtil` instead of the `ExportCommand` class.

==== Implementation: Subclasses of `ExportCommand`

Exporting all the data from Alfred to a CSV file is nice, but sometimes, the user may only want the data of a specific entity. This would be handled by the subclasses of `ExportCommand`, which consists of `ExportMentorCommand`, `ExportParticipantCommand`, and `ExportTeamCommand`. Similar to their superclass, the subclasses also depend on `FileUtil` and `CsvUtil` classes to create and write data to CSV files.

The overall flow is the same so you can refer to the aforementioned <<ExportCommandActivityDiagram, activity diagram>> and <<ExportCommandSequenceDiagram, sequence diagram>> for more information. The only difference is when the subclasses call `CsvUtil`. If you recall, `ExportCommand` passes `Model` to `CsvUtil`. For each subclass, they will retrieve the respective `ReadOnlyEntityList` and pass to `CsvUtil`. The above activity diagram shows that in `CsvUtil`, it makes three method calls to itself: `#writeToCsv(File, MentorList)`, `#writeToCsv(File, ParticipantList)`, and `#writeToCsv(File, TeamList)`. These three methods are the methods that each subclass will call.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Selective Exporting of Data

* *Alternative 1:* Do not allow selective exporting

** Pros: Simple to implement
** Cons: User may want to export a portion of data in Alfred

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Allow user to export data of specific entity type

** Pros: Allows user to narrow the scope down to what is necessary for the user
** Pros: Relatively simpler to implement than Alternative 3
** Cons: User may want to export some data each across different entity types

* *Alternative 3:* Allow user to specify a range of entity IDs to export

** Pros: Gives user complete freedom in which data is exported
** Cons: May be too much work for little value (if user does not find this useful)

For now, we have chosen *Alternative 2*. We thought allowing the user to choose a specific entity type would be sufficient. But implementing *Alternative 3* can be done in the future to make Alfred even more customizable for the user. It would not replace *Alternative 2* but the two will exist side by side. Depending on the additional parameters inputted by the user, commands will execute differently.

===== Aspect: Type of Files to Support

* *Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Support CSV file only

** Pros: Simple to implement
** Pros: Standard of file formatting is simple
** Cons: Little freedom for the user
** Cons: User may not be familiar with a CSV file
** Cons: One can argue that Excel is easier to edit than CSV

* *Alternative 2:* Support a variety of file extensions

** Pros: Gives user a lot of freedom
** Cons: Parsing rules for different files may be cumbersome to implement
** Cons: Having a unified standard for file formatting may not be optimal

For now, data can only be exported to CSV files. This aspect can also be under the <<ImportCommandDesignConsiderations, design considerations>> of `ImportCommand`. In the future, we can increase the number of file extensions supported.

// tag::undoredoDG1[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

The Undo/Redo feature, as the name suggests, allows you to undo and redo commands. Only commands that alter the state of the data
in Alfred can be undone/redone. The state of the 3 EntityLists (ParticipantList, MentorList and TeamList) is tracked across the execution
of different commands, and the state can be recovered through the use of the undo/redo feature. The last used IDs for each of the 3 EntityLists
are also saved.

The feature has been updated in v1.4 to support multiple undos/redos. This means that invoking `undo N`/`redo N` on Alfred, where `N`
is an integer, allows you to undo/redo `N` commands at one go.

To undo/redo to next immediate command, simply invoking `undo`/`redo` on Alfred would suffice, as it implicitly calls `undo 1`/`redo 1`
in the code.

This feature is a convenience feature as it allows users of Alfred to quickly correct and recover
from mistakes, greatly increasing the utility of the application.

[NOTE]
Only a maximum of 50 data states is stored in `ModelHistoryManager` at any one point in time. The addition of any more data states will
result in the discarding of the oldest data state.

==== Implementation

The general idea is as follows: The undo/redo mechanism is mainly facilitated by the interface `ModelHistory` and its implementation `ModelHistoryManager`.
Alfred's data is held in memory within the `ModelManager` object. After the execution of commands that mutate the data in Alfred, a deep copy
of all 3 EntityLists is made and saved as a `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager`. A deep copy is necessary to ensure that
any subsequent changes to data will not alter the data in the `ModelHistoryRecord`, allowing each `ModelHistoryRecord` to serve as
a pristine record of the state of the data in Alfred at the end of the execution of each command.

Whenever the `undo` command is invoked, `ModelHistoryManager` returns a `ModelHistoryRecord`.
A deep copy of the EntityLists contained within `ModelHistoryRecord` are then used to replace the EntityLists in the `ModelManager` for its operations, effectively
reverting the data in Alfred to a previous state.

[NOTE]
The data in each `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager` is stored in memory, and is not stored on disc, so it will
persist only while the Alfred application is running.

==== Implementation: How `ModelHistoryManager` Keeps Track of the State of the Data in Alfred
The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of method calls used to store the state of the data in
Alfred in `ModelHistory` (`ModelHistoryManager` is an implementation of the `ModelHistory` interface) after
the execution of a DeleteParticipantCommand:

.Sequence Diagram for the Updating of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoSequenceDiagramUpdateHistory.png[]

The top half of the diagram covers the creation of the DeleteParticipantCommand object, and the bottom half covers
what happens when the `execute()` method of the DeleteParticipantCommand object is called. The important thing to note is the fact
that a deep copy of the 3 EntityLists is created and stored as a `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager`.

An important issue to take note of is that only commands that implement the TrackableState interface will cause a new `ModelHistoryRecord`
to be created and stored in `ModelHistoryManager`. The TrackableState interface is a marker interface, and is used to mark
the commands that mutate data in Alfred. All command types except the following implement the TrackableState interface (and
will therefore have the state of the data recorded in `ModelHistoryManager` after command execution):
`help`, `list`, `find`, `history`, `leaderboard`, `getTop`, `export`, `help`, `home`, `undo`, `redo`.

// end::undoredoDG1[]

==== Implementation: How `ModelManager` is Updated When the Undo Command is Executed
The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the UndoCommand is executed.

.Sequence Diagram for the Execution of the Undo Command
image::UndoSequenceDiagramExecutionofUndo.png[]

The important issue to take note of here is that the code first checks whether it is valid to undo to a certain state by
calling the `canUndo()` method in `ModelHistory`. The implementation of `ModelHistory` in `ModelHistoryManager` does so by checking
if there are sufficient states to undo to, otherwise an exception is thrown.

[NOTE]
A analogous process is executed for the Redo Command.

// tag::undoredoDG2[]
==== Behaviour of Undo/Redo Mechanism
`ModelHistoryMangager` contains a List of `ModelHistoryRecord`, and a pointer pointing to the `ModelHistoryRecord` that
reflects the current state of the data in Alfred.

In order to better illustrate how the state of the data is tracked and stored in `ModelHistoryManager`, consider the following example.
The following commands are executed:

1. AddParticipantCommand: `add participant n/Clark Kent p/+6598321212 e/clark.kent@supermail.com`

2. AddMentorCommand: `add mentor n/Lex Luthor o/LexCorp p/+6598321010 e/lex.not.evil@gmail.com s/Social`

3. ListParticipantCommand: `list participants`

4. UndoCommand: `undo 2`

5. AddTeamCommand: `add team n/Justice League s/Social pn/BetterThanAvengers l/12`

This is the state of `ModelHistoryManager` when Alfred is first started.

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::UndoRedoState0.png[]


This is what happens after each step:

__ Step 1. AddParticipantCommand: `add participant n/Clark Kent p/+6598321212 e/clark.kent@supermail.com` __

.State of `ModelHistoryManager` after Step 1
image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

A new `ModelHistoryRecord` is created to reflect the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of the AddParticipantCommand.

__ Step 2. AddMentorCommand: `add mentor n/Lex Luthor o/LexCorp p/+6598321010 e/lex.not.evil@gmail.com s/Social` __

.State of `ModelHistoryManager` after Step 2
image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

A new `ModelHistoryRecord` is created to reflect the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of the AddMentorCommand.

__ Step 3. ListParticipantCommand: `list participants` __

.State of `ModelHistoryManager` after Step 3
image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

Note that no new `ModelHistoryRecord` is created because the ListParticipantCommand does not alter the state of the data in Alfred.
Hence, it does not implement the TrackableState interface.

__ Step 4. UndoCommand: `undo 2` __

.State of `ModelHistoryManager` after Step 4
image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

After executing the `undo 2` command, the pointer in `ModelHistoryManager` shifts backwards by 2 to point to the `ModelHistoryRecord`
at the zero-th index.

Note that this means that `undo 3` would throw an error, as you cannot move beyond the very first `ModelHistoryRecord` in `ModelHistoryManager`.

__ Step 5. AddTeamCommand: `add team n/Justice League s/Social pn/BetterThanAvengers l/12` __

.State of `ModelHistoryManager` after Step 5
image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

Note that the execution of a new command will invalidate the `ModelHistoryRecord` after the pointer. This is because all subsequent
data states are the result of transformations that have already been undone, so it is not valid to be able to `redo` to them.

==== Design Considerations
When designing the undo/redo feature, there were some design considerations to take note of.

===== Aspect: How Undo/Redo Executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire data state of Alfred in memory.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct, which is not trivial for
certain commands, such as `import`, which provides a best-effort implementation and tries to import as many valid data entries
as possible. In order to implement an `undo` method for this, we would have to keep track of the new Entities that got created
due to the command execution and then invoke deletion of these Entities.

Given the large number of commands that are available in Alfred, it is not very scalable to implement
an undo/redo method for each of the commands. It is also more extensible to use Alternative 1 as it allows
future commands to be added without the need for further changes for the undo/redo feature - simply get the new
command's class to implement the TrackableState interface if it alters the state of the data in Alfred.

===== Aspect: Use of Marker Interface
Allows for an easy way to determine if the state of the data should be saved after the execution of the command.
It is also very easy to change in the codebase. This means that should a feature in the future alter the state of the
data in Alfred after execution, it is trivial to allow `ModelHistoryManager` to track the state.

===== Aspect: Limitation of Number of Data States Stored
Given that the Undo/Redo feature saves the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of TrackableState commands,
it is important to ensure that memory usage by `ModelHistoryManager` is limited, otherwise Alfred will run very slowly and
potentially crash once a substantial number of commands have been executed.

In order to accommodate this design for the Undo/Redo feature, we decided to limit the number of `ModelHistoryRecord` stored in
`ModelHistoryManager` to 50. It is unlikely that a user would want to undo more than 50 commands at a go, as that would indicate
a very significant error in the workflow, and recovering from that should not have a reliance on the Undo/Redo feature.

// end::undoredoDG2[]

=== History feature

Closely related to the undo/redo feature, the `history` feature allows you to examine up to 50 previously executed commands
in order to provide you with a visual understanding of the history of commands executed. Specifically, it provides you information
on how many commands are undo-able/redo-able, and which commands are undo-able/redo-able. Otherwise, it can be difficult to
know which commands you are undo/redo-ing, especially when many commands have been executed.

Simply execute `history` in Alfred to navigate to the "History" section of the Graphical User Interface and examine what commands
are undo-able/redo-able.

."History" section of the Graphical User Interface after invoking the `history` command
image::UndoRedoExplanation.png[]

Note that there are 3 types of delimiters:

1. Redo Delimiter: No redos are possible beyond this point
2. Current Delimiter: This is the current state of the data relative to all the commands previously executed.
3. Undo Delimiter: No undos are possible beyond this point

==== Implementation
Most of the functionality required for the `history` feature is similar to that of the `undo`/`redo` feature. Specifically,
there is a similar reliance on the `ModelHistory` interface and its implementation `ModelHistoryManager` to provide the information
on which commands are undo-able and redo-able, along with their respective command input strings. See the sequence diagram below
for more information.

.Sequence diagram for the execution of the History command
image::HistoryCommandRendering.png[]

Since `ModelHistoryManager` keeps a linear history of Alfred's data state after commands are executed, and it has a pointer
to the current data state, the redo-able commands are simply the ones after the pointer, and the undo-able commands are the one before
the pointer. The panels displayed in the "History" section of the Graphical User Interface is simply a visual representation of
this sequential ordering of datas states. The call to `getCommandHistory()` in Model will return an ArrayList of CommandRecords, where each CommandRecord
specifies the command input string as well as whether the CommandRecord is a delimiter. This ArrayList is then provided back to
the UI for rendering in the "History" section of the Graphical User Interface.

==== Design Considerations
Given the close relationship between this feature and the `undo`/`redo` feature, the design considerations are very similar as well.
See <<Undo/Redo feature>> for more information.

=== Command History Navigation
Since Alfred is ultimately a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application, it would be good to integrate some of the more useful features
of CLI applications into Alfred. This feature allows users to go through previously executed commands by pressing the ALT+UP/DOWN
arrow keys. Although it would be more convenient to use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to navigate the command history, the UP/DOWN arrow
keys have been mapped to the Command Suggestions feature in Alfred.

This feature allows users to quickly re-use previously exeuted commands without having to go through the hassle of re-typing
everything. This is particularly useful when the commands are long, and only small modifications are necessary to the command.

[NOTE]
Only successfully executed commands can be navigated to using the ALT+UP/DOWN keys. Invalid comands will not be stored, and hence
cannot be accessed using this feature. The only exception to this is the `import` command, as it is a 'best-effort' command that raises exceptions for certain entries
in the csv file, but seeks to import as many valid data entries as possible. Hence, the `import` command can be navigated to using
the ALT+UP/DOWN arrow keys even when it does not completely succeed during execution.

==== Implementation
Every time a valid new command is executed, the string used to generate the command (i.e. the text that the user types into
Alfred's Command Input Box) is stored in the `Command` object.

The main class responsible for remembering and providing the previously used command input strings is the `CommandHistoryManager` class,
which implements the `CommandHistory` interface. The `CommandHistory` interface only exposes 3 methods: `saveCommandExecutionString`,
`getPrevCommandString` and `getNextCommandString`. The latter 2 methods directly map to the 2 situations of pressing the ALT+UP and
pressing the ALT+DOWN keys respectively.

When the `Command` object is executed, that string is then stored in the `CommandHistoryManager`. A linear list of successfully
executed commands' input strings is stored in `CommandHistoryManager`, and a pointer to the current string being displayed in the textbox
is used to indicate which is the currently active string.

[NOTE]
Only the last 50 commands are stored in `CommandHistoryManager`. Anything beyond that is discarded.

==== Implementation: Setting and Storing of Command Input String
The following sequence diagram describes the sequence of method calls used to set and store the command input string in
`CommandHistoryManager`

.Initial State of `ModelHistoryManager`
image::CommandHistoryNavigationSettingofCommandString.png[]

==== Implementation: Arrow Key Invocation
The following sequence diagram describes the sequence of method calls used to set the text in Alfred's Command Input Box
whenever the ALT + UP/DOWN arrow keys are pressed.

.Sequence Diagram for when ALT+UP arrow keys are pressed
image::CommandHistoryNavigationArrowKeyInvocation.png[]

An analogous process is executed when the ALT+DOWN arrow keys are pressed.

==== Design Considerations
The following are some design considerations for the Command History Navigation feature.

===== Aspect: Use of CommandHistoryManager
A separate class was created for managing the command history. Although this meant that Model would have a further
dependency on another class and hence cause an increase in the coupling between objects, this implementation adheres
to the Single Responsibility Principle and abstracts away the details of handling the command history to a purpose-built class.
This adheres better to the OOP-style of programming and results in conceptually cleaner code.

===== Aspect: Limitation of Command History Size
In order to ensure that `CommandHistoryManager` does not occupy an increasingly large portion of memory as more and more
commands are executed, it is necessary to limit the number of commands that are stored. Otherwise, Alfred's performance
will suffer as more commands are executed.

Furthermore, it is very unlikely for user to want to navigate more than 50 commands into history, as it would likely be
more convenient to re-type the command if that is the case.

===== Aspect: Usage of Arrow Keys
Most CLI applications with such a Command History Navigation feature would use the UP/DOWN arrow keys directly, but the UP/DOWN
arrow keys have been mapped for a different use (Command Suggestion Feature) in Alfred. Hence, we decided to use the ALT modifier key for the feature. It is
an inconvenience, but likely a minor one.

===== Aspect: Navigation to Successfully-Executed Commands
As mentioned above, only successfully executed commands can be navigated to using this feature. This is because unsuccessful
commands will still remain within the Command Input Box in Alfred, which the user can readily edit. Only upon successful command
execution will the text in the Command input Box disappear, so this feature is necessary to retrieve the Command's input text.

//tag::home[]
=== Home feature

Entering the `home` command will prompt the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic`]to generate a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Statistics.java[`Statistics`] object. The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Statistics.java[`Statistics`]  object is generated by obtaining entity lists of different types(ParticipantList, TeamList, MentorList) from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`]. The respective lists are then converted to the Stream data structure and filtered through to obtain the distribution of each entity type by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Subject.java[`Subject`], as well as the total number of each entity. These information is stored in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Statistics.java[`Statistics`]  object. The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Statistics.java[`Statistics`] object is then used to construct a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatisticsListPanel.java[`StatisticsListPanel`], where the information is parse to be displayed as a distribution bar graph.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `home` operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for `home` command
image::HomeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[][width=790,height=480]

==== Design Considerations
The following are some design considerations for the `home` command.

===== Aspect: Finding the distribution of Teams and Mentors by subjects

* Alternative 1: Implementing methods to keep track of number of mentors or participant under the respective TeamList or ParticipantList class.
**	Pros: Each of TeamList or  Participant list will have their individual responsibilities in keeping track of the distribution of its teams or mentors.
** Cons: Clutters up the Model and ModelManger interface.
**	Cons: Does not make use of existing methods under Model.

* Alternative 2: Getting TeamList or ParticipantList from Model and implementing operation to find the distribution separately.
** Pros: Makes use of existing Model methods of getting TeamList and ParticipantList.
**	Pros: Does not clutter up Model and ModelManager with different methods
**	Pros: Greater flexibility in implementing methods to find the distribution of teams or mentors.
**	Cons: Clutters up the Model and ModelManger interface.
**	Cons: Does not make use of existing methods under Model.

Decision: We decided to proceed with this alternative 2 because it makes use of existing methods under Model and provides greater flexibility on how I can find the distribution number by subject from the TeamList or ParticipantList.
//end::home[]

//tag::command-suggestion[]
=== Command suggestion feature
This feature provides suggestions by predicting the commands that a user intends to enter.

[NOTE]
Only suggestions that start with the same alphabets or spaces as those entered by user will be suggested.

==== Implementation
The main class responsible providing suggestions is the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/AutoCompleteCommandBox.java[`AutoCompleteCommandBox`] class.Typing into the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/AutoCompleteCommandBox.java[`AutoCompleteCommandBox`] will prompt the attached link:https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/beans/value/ChangeListener.html[`Listener`] to be activated.
Activation of the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/beans/value/ChangeListener.html[`Listener`] will prompt it to filter through the set of predefined command suggestions.
The commands that start with the same alphabet or alphabets entered by user will be filtered through.
The first four result will then be mapped to their respective link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/text/TextFlow.html[`TextFlow`] object and added to the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/ContextMenu.html[`ContextMenu`].
This link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/ContextMenu.html[`ContextMenu`] will then appear as a pop up box. Pressing up arrow and down arrow keys will enable the user to choose a command suggestion.
Additionally, pressing kbd:[enter] will filter out different https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/text/Text.html[`Text`] from the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/text/TextFlow.html[`TextFlow`] object. The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/AutoCompleteCommandBox.java[`AutoCompleteCommandBoxsetText`] method will then be called to set the link:https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix/blob/master/jfoenix/src/main/java/com/jfoenix/controls/JFXTextField.java[`JFXTextField`] to the said link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/text/Text.html[`Text`] object.
//end::command-suggestion[]

====== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store a set of correct commands and search through it as the user types
 In order to provide suggestions as a user types, there needs to be a way to store the set of correct commands as strings in the system, and search through it to check if it contains some parts of user input. The results will then be provided to the user as suggestions.
* *Alternative 1:* Use an `ArrayList` and go through every element in the array list one by one to look for commands that matches the user input.

* *Pros*: Easy to implement

* *Pros*: When new commands are implemented, they can easily be added into the `ArrayList`

* *Cons*: Allows duplicates, if duplicate commands are added into the `ArrayList`, duplicate suggestions may be provided.

* *Cons*: Searching through the `ArrayList` is inefficient as `Stream` is not used.

* *Alternative 2*: Store the commands in a `Set` and convert it to a `Stream` to search through the commands.

**Pros*: Prevent duplicates, so that duplicate commands will not be entered accidentally.

* *Pros*: More efficient.

* *Pros*: Easier to search through the set of commands when it is stored as `Stream`.

I have decided to proceed with this option as preventing duplicates enables a more defensive style of programming. It is also more efficient.

===== Aspect: How to fill up user input text field when a command suggestion is chosen

upon choosing a command suggestion, it template(the command suggestion excluding blue-colored instructions and grey-colored guides) will be used to occupy the user input text field.

* *Alternative 1* :Map each command suggestion to their respective templates in `String` form

* *Pros*: Easy to implement.

* *Cons*: Tedious to implement(requires many lines of code).

* *Cons*: Duplicate logic will be implemented, as the templates could be extracted from the command suggestion itself.

* *Alternative 2* : Filter out the relevant text template from the command suggestion that is choosen.

* *Pros*: No duplicate logic is implemented as the templates are extracted directly from the choosen command suggestion.

* *Pros*: Lesser code needs to be written in order to extract the template from the choosen command suggestion.

* *Pros*: Use of regular express ion may be harder to implement.

Upon successful removal of Participant or Team, the specified participant or mentor will be removed from the Team object. Additionally, it calls the following operations:

*	link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager#addMentorToTeam`] – adds mentor to a specified team
*	link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager#addParticipantToTeam`] – adds participant to team
*	link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager#removeParticipantFromTeam`] – removes participant from team
* link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager#removeMentorFromTeam`] – removes mentor from team

==== `assign` feature
1. The `assign participant` command will add the new participant under the list of participant in the specified link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Team`] object. This is provided that the number of members in the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Team`] object(size of list of participants) is less than 5.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `assign participant` operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for an example of `assign participant` command
image::AssignParticipantCommandSequenceDiagram.png[][width=790,height=480]

2. The `assign mentor` command will add the new mentor under the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Optional<Mentor>`] field in the specified link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Team`] object. This is provided that there is no existing mentor in the team. The sequence diagram of `assign mentor` is similar to that of `assign participant`.

==== `remove` feature
1. The remove participant will first search through the list of participant under the specified link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Team`] object. This checks whether the specified participant is a member of the team in the first place. If it is not a member, an error will be thrown. Whereas if it is a member, the specified participant will be removed from the list of participant.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `remove participant` operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for an example of `remove participant` command
image::RemoveParticipantCommandSequenceDiagram.png[][width=790,height=480]



2. The `remove mentor` command  will first check whether the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Optional<Mentor>`] field under the specified link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Team`] object is not empty and corresponds to the specified mentor. This checks whether the team have not been assigned a mentor, or they have been assigned to a different mentor. Under any of these cases, and error will be thrown. Whereas if the team is assigned the specific mentor, the specified mentor will be removed from the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entity/Team.java[`Optional<Mentor>`] field.The sequence diagram of `remove mentor` is similar to that of `remove participant`.

=== Scoring

As its name suggests, this feature's intended purpose is to aid users in the process of giving scores to the teams participating the hackathon. The `score` command is a crucial feature of Alfred as judging and scoring are core activities within every hackathon. Alfred provides the following implementations of the `score` command:

1. `score add`: allows users to add a certain number of points to a team's score
2. `score sub`: allows users to subtract a certain number of points from a team's score
3. `score set`: allows users to set a team's score to a certain number of points
4. `score reset`: allows users reset a team's score to 0

==== Implementation Overview

This feature and its varieties have been implemented in a relatively straightforward manner, as the Class Diagram below showing the high level representation of the Object Oriented solution devised to implement this feature highlights.

.Scoring Feature Class Diagram
image::ScoringClassDiagram.png[]

From the above diagram it can be seen that each different implementation of the `score` command inherits from the same `ScoreCommand` abstract class. The `ScoreCommand` abstract class provides a base for the implementation of the current specific `score` commands and in the future any further additions made to the `score` command functionality must also follow this same convention.

Secondly, there is no `ResetScoreCommand` class. This is done intentionally as the `SetScoreCommand` can be reused to reset a particular team's score, thereby making better use of abstraction.

A representation of how the above classes interact to provide execute a user's command is highlighted in the sequence diagram below. This sequence diagram illustrates the object interactions when a user types the command `score add T-1 40`. For context, this command adds 40 points to the team with ID "T-1".

.Add Score Command Sequence Diagram
image::ScoringSequenceDiagram.png[]

As seen from the above diagram, the execution of the `score add` command can be put in simple words as per the following steps:

* Step 1: `LogicManager` starts executing the user's command and calls the `AlfredParser` to parse it.
* Step 2: `AlfredParser` find the appropriate `Parser` to parse the command and creates a new `ScoreCommandParser` to parse the arguments of the score command, essentially "add T-1 40".
* Step 3: The `ScoreCommandParser` then parses the arguments and is responsible for:

    ** Checking which specific implementation of the `score` command is being called (in this case "add") and ensuring it is a valid method.
    ** Parsing the Team ID specified by the user and ensuring it is of a correct format.
    ** Parsing the Score specified by the user and ensuring it is a valid score.

* Step 4: `ScoreCommandParser` then creates a new `AddScoreCommand` object with the above parsed Team ID and Score, which is then returned all the way to `LogicManager`
* Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `AddScoreCommand` object upon which the `AddScoreCommand` object calls `Model` 's `addTeamScore()` method which updates the specific team's score within `Model`. The updating is done by the `updateTeam(teamID, updatedTeam)` method of `Model` which updates the Team object with ID "teamID" within `Model` to match the "updatedTeam" team object.
* Step 6: Upon updating the team's score in `Model`, the `AddScoreCommand` object creates a new `CommandResult` object which is returned to the UI component (not shown in the diagram) to display a feedback message to the user.

Though the above diagram and steps are designed in the context of a `score add` command, the logic applies to every other type of `score` command as well. The only difference is that the `ScoreCommandParser` creates the appropriate command object for the command and each command object calls a different method from `Model`, as per the following:

1. `score subtract`: `ScoreCommandParser` creates a new `SubtractScoreCommand` instead of an `AddScoreCommand` and this `SubtractScoreCommand` object calls the `subtractTeamScore()` method of `Model`.
2. `score set` and `score reset`: `ScoreCommandParser` creates a new `SetScoreCommand` instead of an `AddScoreCommand` and this `SetScoreCommand` object calls the `setTeamScore()` of method `Model`.

==== Design Considerations

To develop the `score` feature a few considerations and decisions had to be made with regards to how to implement the feature at various steps. This section focuses on some of the aspects wherein we faced dilemmas and how we addressed them.

===== Aspect: How to implement the Score Commands

Currently, Alfred's score commands all inherit from a single `ScoreCommand` abstract class rather than each command class inheriting directly from the command class. This was done in order to provide a concrete base for the score commands, but more importantly also to make better use of polymorphism within our codebase. This use of polymorphism allows the Alfred codebase to avoid several code repetitions, for example by facilitating the use of a single parser class to parse the `score` commands as it can then simply return a `ScoreCommand` object regardless of which specific `score` command is called. Thanks to this, we avoid having to make a parser for every single `score` command.

===== Aspect: How to implement `score sub` (Subtract Score Command)

While traditionally a subtract command would be implemented using an add command only with negated values, this is not quite possible in Alfred's case. Within Alfred `Score` objects have a strict restriction that they cannot be created with negative values as a team's score can never be negative. This restriction cannot be relaxed as it ensures that any data being imported into Alfred does not violate this property either. Due to this the `score sub` command could be implemented by reusing the `AddScoreCommand` and hence why it has its own command class `SubtractScoreCommand`.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `score reset` command

* *Alternative 1:* Create a `ResetScoreCommand` class

** Pros: Lowers confusion as all the relevant code is in its own class rather than mixed with other code.
** Cons: Leads to duplication of code as the command is very similar to the `score set` command, making it poor software engineering practice.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Reuse the `SetScoreCommand` class

** Pros: Better use of abstraction and reduces the amount of duplicate code written.
** Cons: Overcrowds a single class as feedback messages and other properties of the `score reset` command also need to be written within it.

Upon close inspection it was observed that the removal of duplicate code would far outweigh the convenience and orderliness of having a separate class for the command, especially considering that a `ResetScoreCommand` would have far more duplicate code than unique code as compared to the `SetScoreCommand`. Bearing this in mind, we ultimately decided to choose "Alternative 2" as it would allow for better reuse of existing code and follow better software engineering practices.


// tag::leaderboardCommand[]

=== Leaderboard and Get Top Teams

The `leaderboard` and `getTop K` commands are two very important features of Alfred as they allow the user to automatically sort the teams by their scores, fetch any number of top teams in the competition and identify and break ties between teams conveniently. The execution of either of these commands displays the resultant teams on the UI in their correct sorted order. The following subsections explore the implementation of each of these commands and provide an insight into the design consideration made when developing them.

==== Implementation Overview

The implementation of these two commands is very similar in nature. They both:

* rely on updating a `SortedList` of teams present within the `ModelManager` class, which will be referred to as `sortedTeamList` in subsequent sections. This list is used to display the command's results on the UI.
* use an ArrayList of `Comparator<Team>` objects to contain additional comparators. These are used to break ties between teams on a basis other than score.
* use a `SubjectName` object to filter the leaderboard or top teams by a certain category, if specified by the user.

The class diagram below provides a high level representation of the Object-Oriented solution devised to implement the `leaderboard` and `getTop K` commands.

.Leaderboard and Get Top Teams Implementation Overview
image::LeaderBoardClassDiagram.png[]

From the above class diagram, there are two important matters to note regarding the implementation of these features:

[none]
* 1. The `LeaderboardCommand` and `GetTopTeamsCommand` are implemented as abstract classes which extend the `Command` abstract class. Any command to do with leaderboards or getting the top teams extends either one of these abstract classes depending on which command it is.
* 2. The `ModelManager` class uses another class `LeaderboardUtil` which provides utility methods for the Leaderboard and Get Top Teams commands, such as fetching an appropriate number of teams for the `getTop K` command and breaking ties between teams for both commands.

With the class structure covered, the following sub-sections explain how the different classes in Alfred interact to produce a result for the user, and finally the design considerations that were made for each command.

==== Leaderboard Command Implementation

The `leaderboard` command fetches a leaderboard consisting of all the teams registered for the hackathon, in descending order of their score. Moreover, if the user specifies a `SubjectName` then the leaderboard will only consist of teams with that particular subject.

Additionally, if tiebreak methods are specified, ties between the teams will be broken in one of two ways (or a combination of both):

* *Comparison-based tiebreakers:* wherein the user picks certain tiebreak methods which rely on comparing certain properties of teams, such as the number of participants they have.
* *Non-Comparison-based tiebreakers:* wherein the user breaks ties on non-comparison based methods (currently only the "random" method) in addition to any Comparison-based tiebreakers.

[[SimpleLeaderboard-Explanation]]

Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command `leaderboard tb/moreParticipants s/Social`. For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to precede a tie-break method, "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants, and "Social" is a `SubjectName` within Alfred. Essentially this demonstrates the flow for a "Comparison-based tiebreak".

.Interactions within Logic Component for SimpleLeaderboardCommand
image::SimpleLeaderboardSequenceDiagram.png[]

The observations of the above diagram can be put into the following steps:

* Step 1: `LogicManager` starts executing the user's command and calls the `AlfredParser` to parse it.
* Step 2: `AlfredParser` find the appropriate `Parser` to parse the command and creates a new `LeaderboardCommandParser` to parse the arguments of the leaderboard command, essentially "tb/moreParticipants s/Social".
* Step 3: The `LeaderboardCommandParser` then parses the arguments and is responsible for:

** Checking whether the user has specified a subject. If so it sets the value of a local variable "subjectName" of type "SubjectName" to the appropriate subject, otherwise it stays as null.
** Checking whether any tiebreak methods are present.
** Parsing the tie-break part of the command, particularly "tb/moreParticipants". Based on this input, it creates a new `ArrayList<Comparator<Team>>` object and appends the appropriate comparators to it based on the specified tiebreak methods.

* Step 4: `LeaderboardCommandParser` then creates a new `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object with the above list of comparators and subject as input parameters. This is then returned all the way to `LogicManager`

* Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object upon which the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object calls `Model` 's `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators, subjectName)` where comparators is the ArrayList of comparators and subjectName is the `SubjectName` used to create the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand`.

* Step 6: `Model` 's `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators, subjectName)` method updates the `sortedTeamList` within `Model` itself, by applying the comparators to it and filtering the list by the subjectName specfied.

* Step 7: Upon doing so, the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object creates a new `CommandResult` object which is returned to the UI component (not shown in the diagram) to display a feedback message to the user and signals the UI to display the teams from the `sortedTeamList`.

This flow of events, albeit a few differences, is the same for every variation of the `leaderboard` and `getTop K` commands explored subsequently.

Do note that if the user's input did not specify any tie-break methods, hence just being `leaderboard s/Social` then the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object would be created with an empty ArrayList of comparators. If the user's input did not specify any subject, hence just being `leaderboard`, then the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object would be created with the `SubjectName` variable "subjectName" being null, in which case no filtering of `sortedTeamList` takes place. The flow of events for this particular scenario would be unchanged from the above illustration.

The `leaderboard` command with the tiebreak method `random` follows a slightly different sequence. Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events when the user types the command "leaderboard tb/moreParticipants random". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants, and "random" is another non-comparison based tie-break method.

.Interactions within Logic Component for LeaderboardCommand with Random Winners
image::RandomLeaderboardSequenceDiagram.png[]

The above sequence follows the exact same logic as that for the Simple Leaderboard as explained above.

However, in this case the `LeaderboardWithRandomCommand` class calls the `setTopK(teamListSize, comparators, subjectName)` method of `Model` which essentially filters out the teams with subject "subjectName", breaks any remaining ties after applying the tie-break methods between teams on a random basis, and fetches a number of teams equal to `teamListSize` which is the size of the `sortedTeamList`, thereby reflecting the total number of teams in the hackathon.

Secondly, `Model` calls its own method `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators, subjectName)` which was used for the `leaderboard` command without random tiebreak. This method abstracts the process of clearing `sortedTeamList` of any sorting, filters it by `SubjectName` if required, and then applies the new comparators to it. It is used to fetch and appropriately sort the appropriate teams in `sortedTeamList` before the algorithm for random winners can be applied to the `sortedTeamList`.


[[Leaderboard-DesignConsideration]]

==== Design Considerations
There were several questions we asked ourselves over the course of developing the leaderboard feature. The following contains certain aspects we had to consider during the development stage and details how and why we decided to use a certain methodologies over others.

===== Aspect: How to store the sorted list of participants

* *Alternative 1:* Use the existing List in `ModelManager` storing the teams.

** Pros: Easier to implement as lesser extra code involved, as most getters and setters have already been coded.
** Cons: Sorting will be more complicated and potentially slower with large number of teams as the other lists are `FilteredList` objects, whose API doesn't allow direct sorting.
** Cons: An existing List is likely to be used by other commands to display data on the UI, so with any sorting will have to undone each time after use; a process which is prone to careless errors.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Use a new `SortedList` object from the JavaFX Library

** Pros: Easy and quick to sort contents with the `SortedList` API.
** Pros: A new list means the sorting will not interfere with any other feature's operations, such as the `list` command which uses the existing `filteredTeamList` holding all the teams.
** Cons: Another List to handle in `ModelManager` which increases the amount of code.

Due to the overwhelming benefits and conveniences that a new `SortedList` of teams would bring in the development of Alfred's `leaderboard` and `getTop K` commands, particularly with the convenience of sorting it allows through its API, we decided to rely on "Alternative 2" with regards to this dilemma.

===== Aspect: Designing Leaderboard's Command Classes

* *Alternative 1:* Use a single `LeaderboardCommand` class

** Pros: Lesser duplicate code as both ("random" and "non-random") tiebreak methods can be handled within a single class.
** Cons: Introduces control coupling as the `LeaderboardCommandParser` will have to send a flag to `LeaderboardCommand` to indicate whether "random" should be applied or not as a means of tie-break.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Use an Abstract `LeaderboardCommand` class inheriting from `Command` which any `leaderboard` related commands will themselves extend.

** Pros: Single Responsibility Principle will be better respected as any change in logic for one type of `leaderboard` command will only affect its respective class. Secondly, no longer a need for a flag as the parser can directly call the appropriate command class.
** Cons: Introduces slight duplication in code as each class will contain a similar segments of code for checking the status of the teams in `Model`.

We decided to follow "Alternative 2". Firstly, if a single class were being used, it would be difficult to distinguish which type of `leaderboard` command should be called - whether a leaderboard with or without "random" as tiebreak should be used. This would require the `LeaderboardCommandParser` to pass a flag signalling whether the "random" version should be called or not, which introduces control coupling. Although with a single distinct method (ie "random") this seems manageable, as the scale of Alfred increases with more non-comparison based methods such as "random" being introduced, passing a flag from `LeaderboardCommandParser` to the `Leaderboard` command class would become less and less manageable. Secondly, we wanted to avoid coupling the `Parser` and `Command` classes in a way which `Parser` influences the behaviour of the `Command` as it introduces leeway for errors.

// end::leaderboardCommand[]

===== Aspect: Where to Write Algorithms used by `leaderboard` (and `getTop K`) Command

* *Alternative 1:* Write the methods as private within `ModelManager` itself
** Pros: Relevant code is in close proximity to where it is being called allowing for easy reference of what is being done and quick rectification if needed.
** Cons: Would harm Single Responsibility Principle as `ModelManager` would need to be changed in case there is change in required to the Leaderboard Algorithms, whereas it should only be changed if there is a change required to `Model`

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Create a new `LeaderboardUtil` class
** Pros: Maintains single responsibility principle and ensures greater abstraction as complicated algorithms are simply handled by another class altogether.
** Cons: Increases the amount of coding and documentation required. Additionally, it brings about the inconvenience of having to shift between classes to view the available methods and their implementations.

"Alternative 2" was eventually selected as it follows better Object-Oriented Programming practices. By abstracting away the methods used to sort and tie-break teams and keeping them in another class, the overall readability of the code is enhanced and would be easier for any future programmers working on this project to understand and work on.

==== Get Top Teams Implementation

The `getTop K` command fetches the top "K" number teams sorted in descending order of their points, where K is a positive integer inputted by the user. The `getTop K` command follows a similar pattern as the `leaderboard` command in the sense that ties between teams are broken in one of two ways (or a combination of both):

* *Comparison-based tiebreakers:* wherein the user picks certain tiebreak methods which rely on comparing certain properties of teams, such as the number of participants they have.
* *Non-Comparison-based tiebreakers:* wherein the user breaks ties on non-comparison based methods (currently only the "random" method) in addition to any Comparison-based tiebreakers.

Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "getTop 3 tb/moreParticipants". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants. This essentially reflects a tie being broken by comparison-based tiebreakers.

.Interactions within Logic Component for getTop K Command
image::SimpleTopKSequenceDiagram.png[]

The above diagram follows a logic very similar to the `leaderboard` command's logic, and can be broken down into the following steps

* Step 1: `LogicManager` starts executing the user's command and calls the `AlfredParser` to parse it.
* Step 2: `AlfredParser` find the appropriate `Parser` to parse the command and creates a new `TopTeamCommandParser` to parse the arguments of the leaderboard command, essentially "tb/moreParticipants".
* Step 3: The `LeaderboardCommandParser` then parses the arguments and is responsible for:

** Checking whether the value of "K" (3 in this case) the user inputted is valid.
** Checking whether the user has specified a subject. If so it sets the value of a local variable "subjectName" of type "SubjectName" to the appropriate subject, otherwise it stays as null.
** Checking whether any tiebreak methods are present.
** Parsing the tie-break part of the command, particularly "tb/moreParticipants". Based on this input, it creates a new `ArrayList<Comparator<Team>>` object and appends the appropriate comparators to it based on the specified tiebreak methods.

* Step 4: `TopTeamCommandParser` then creates a new `SimpleTopTeamsCommand` object with the above value of "K", list of comparators and subject as input parameters. This is then returned all the way to `LogicManager`

* Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `SimpleTopTeamsCommand` object upon which the `SimpleTopTeamsCommand` object calls `Model` 's `setTopK(3, comparators, subjectName)` where comparators is the ArrayList of comparators and subjectName is the `SubjectName` used to create the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` and 3 is the value of "K" the user supplied.

* Step 6: `Model` 's `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators, subjectName)` method updates the `sortedTeamList` within `Model` itself, by applying the comparators to it and filtering the list by the subjectName specfied. Once this is done, the algorithm to get the top teams is applied the `sortedTeamList` contains the final list of teams.

* Step 7: Upon doing so, the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object creates a new `CommandResult` object which is returned to the UI component (not shown in the diagram) to display a feedback message to the user and signals the UI to display the teams from the `sortedTeamList`.

It is noteworthy that `Model` calls its own method `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)` which was associated with the `leaderboard` command. This is however a simple reuse of code to set the reset `Model` 's `sortedTeamList`, filter it by the subject if needed and apply the relevant comparators to it, before the algorithm for fetching the top three (or any number) teams can be applied.

When it comes to the `getTop K` command being used with the "random" method of tiebreak, the flow of events is resembles the above very closely. Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "getTop 3 tb/moreParticipants random". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants whereas "random" represents the "random" method of tiebreak.

.Interactions within Logic Component for getTop K with Random Winners
image::TopKRandomCommand.png[]

From the above diagram it can be inferred that the implementation of random winners does not deviate far from the implementation without random winners.

The first difference is that the `TopTeamsCommandParser` object now returns a `topKRandomCommand` object. Secondly, the `topKRandomCommand` object calls the `setTopKRandom(3, comparators, subjectName)` method of `Model`. It essentially modifies the `sortedTeamList` within `Model` to only show the top three teams (within a certain subject category if specified) as per their scores and the relevant tiebreakers as per the list of comparators `comparators`, and breaks any remaining ties based on the random method.

==== Design Considerations

Since the implementation of the `getTop K` command is almost identical to that of the `leaderboard` command, the design considerations made for the `leaderboard` command apply to the implementation of this feature as well (See <<Leaderboard-DesignConsideration>>). However, there were some unique aspects we had to consider with regards to the `getTop K` command, all of which is detailed below.

===== Aspect: Where to Store the Top K Teams

* *Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Use the `SortedList` in `ModelManager` used for  the `leaderboard` command.

** Pros: Requires lesser code - a new list would involve new getters and setters and additional code in the UI component to display this list on the UI.
** Cons: Can be cause for confusion since `leaderboard` and `getTop K` commands would be using the same list.

* *Alternative 2:* Use a new `SortedList` object.

** Pros: Less confusion as the `leaderboard` and `getTop K` commands use distinct lists for their operations.
** Cons: Additional code and attention required to handle an additional list, which can lead to potential errors.

After careful consideration, "Alternative 1" was chosen as it would make fewer modification to `ModelManager` and the `UI` component, particularly with regards to adding duplicate code to handle the two different lists. Moreover, since the calls to `ModelManager` 's methods reset the `SortedList` storing the sorted teams, there is likely to be lesser confusion and room for error when handling a single list for the two different commands.

===== Aspect: Handling Situation when `K` is greater than the number of teams

* *Alternative 1 (Current Choice):* Show all the teams in the hackathon

** Pros: Avoids frustrating the user if he constantly inputs a value greater than the number of teams, especially if he wants a quick overview.
** Cons: Could be potentially seen as a bug as users and testers may notice a disparity between the number of teams shown and the number requested for.

* *Alternative 2:* Display an error to the user

** Pros: May prevent some confusion in case user notices a disparity between the value he inputted and the number of teams actually shown.
** Cons: Can be frustrating in case user wants a quick overview without having to worry about the total number of teams present.

We decided to prioritise user convenience in this situation and rather than displaying an error every time he inputs a value too large for `K` in the `getTop K` command, we decided to show all the teams. This aspect of the feature has been made abundantly clear in the User Guide and seeks to minimise user frustration especially since we do not want the user to worry too much about remembering how many teams have signed up.

===== Aspect: Implementation of Leaderboard

* *Alternative 1:* Implement `leaderboard` command with `getTop K` command keeping `K` as the size of the teamlist

** Pros: Better and greater re-usage of code present within `ModelManager`.
** Cons: Introduces coupling as changes made to the `getTop K` command will affect the `leaderboard` command.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Have a separate method within `ModelManager` to handle the `leaderboard` command.

** Pros: The two commands' logic are kept separate so neither affects the other in case of changes.
** Cons: May be seen as a duplication of code.

The reason "Alternative 2" was selected was because `ModelManager` 's `setSimpleLeaderboard(ArrayList<Comparator<Team>> comparators)` method resets the `SortedList` of teams within `ModelManager` and applies the relevant comparators to it to sort it as desired. Hence, it is abstracting away this process into a single method so a better re-usage of code can take place in other methods. This method is reused by `ModelManager` 's `setTopK()` method when using the `getTop K` command, whereas the `setSimpleLeaderboard(ArrayList<Comparator<Team>> comparators)` method is sufficient to sort *all* the teams in the desired order. So instead of calling it again within another method, the `setSimpleLeaderboard(ArrayList<Comparator<Team>> comparators)` method which was meant to abstract away some processes is itself used to handle the `leaderboard` command. So indeed in the end, "Alternative 2" does not introduce duplication of code, but rather introduces better use of abstraction.

==== Tiebreaking and Filtering by Subject

In the above sections, the UML diagrams gloss over how tiebreaking and filtering by subjects is parsed and understood by Alfred. This process is better explored in this section as per the explanations below.

The basic of tie-breaking revolves around using `Comparator` s to sort the teams in a particular order. Each tiebreak method available in Alfred has a `Comparator` associated to it and all these can be found in the `Comparators` class.

The basic of filtering by subject revolves around the `SubjectName` input parameter to the `LeaderboardCommand` and `GetTopTeamsCommand` classes. The user's specified subject is parsed and used as an input parameter in the aforementioned classes' constructors, which they then use for filtering the `sortedTeamList` in `Model`.

The activity diagram below illustrates the internal workings within the `LeaderboardCommandParser` and `TopTeamsCommandParser` when parsing tiebreak methods and the subject. Do note that in the below diagram the term `Parser` encapsulates both of these `Parser` s as they operate in almost identical ways.

.Handling of Tiebreak Methods
image::TieBreakActivityDiagram.png[]

From the above there is one important aspect to note: the `ArrayList` of `Comparator<Team>` objects created in the second step. This is the `ArrayList` referred to in the previous sections which is tasked with containing and transferring the comparators which will be used to sort the teams in their appropriate order to form the leaderboard or top teams. This `ArrayList` is used as an input parameter for both `leaderboard` and `getTop K` command related classes, as explored in previous sections.

Additionally, before `comparators` can be passed as an argument to the commands, it is reversed. This is done intentionally so the comparators related to each tiebreak method are applied in an order such that they preserve the oder the user wants the tiebreak methods to be applied.

Secondly, if no subject is specified by the user, then the default value of the `subjectName` variable (of type `SubjectName`) is null. This signals to methods in `Model` (when the command is executed thereby calling `Model` 's methods) that no filtering of the `sortedTeamList` is required.

Note that the diagram above assumes there are no syntax errors made by the user when typing out the command. In case of any errors in the command, a `ParseException` would be thrown warning the user of such a situation. These have been excluded from the above diagram to prevent overcrowding and a deviation from the basic logic.

==== Design Considerations

Though this was a relatively straightforward subset of our `leaderboard` and `getTop K` command, there were still a few, small design considerations made.

===== Aspect: Signaling No Subject Filtering

* *Alternative 1:* Use Java's Optional class with the optional variable being empty.
** Pros: Less prone to misuse which can cause exceptions.
** Cons: Leads to unnecessary wrapping and unwrapping of the variable simply to check whether a value is present.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Use a variable of type `SubjectName` set to null.
** Pros: Easier to implement. No boxing and unboxing required.
** Cons: Can lead to unexpected exceptions if not handled carefully.

* *Alternative 3:* Use overloaded constructors for `LeaderboardCommand` and `GetTopTeamsCommand`.
** Pros: Reduces the potential of mishandling null values which can lead to unwanted exceptions arising in the code.
** Cons: Introduces extra logic in form of "if-else" statements to determine which constructors must be called. This would make the code slightly less readable and more complicated.

In the end "Alternative 2" was favoured over the other two alternatives. Although the misuse of null can lead to unwanted exceptions, it has been carefully used to ensure that at no point is null value used other than to check once whether the variable's value is null or not. This careful implementation ensures that the variable is used selectively at only one place thereby making sure that no possibility `NullPointerException" occurs at any other part of the code. Moreover, it has been reinforced through thorough documentation of the constructors to guide future contributors. Although "Alternative 3" is a standard solution to null input parameters, in this case it would not serve its purpose too well as calling the overloaded constructor would require additional logic to check whether or not the subject is mentioned and then depending on this result which command needs to be created and returned. Java's Optional class provides a good alternative, however it was not selected as it leads to needless wrapping and unwrapping of the variable, adding another layer of packaging and unpacking.

===== Aspect: Where to create comparators

* *Alternative 1:* Create comparators when parsing each tiebreak method
** Pros: Easier to implement as it does not require additional classes.
** Cons: Can overcrowd a single method or class especially as more comparison methods are added. This is also a poor use of abstraction and would not respect Single Responsibility Principle.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Create a separate `Comparators` class where relevant comparators are created beforehand and can be invoke using static methods.
** Pros: Better use of abstraction and maintains Single Responsibility Principle as the parser class can focus on solely parsing the user commands.

In the end, "Alternative 2" was selected as it follows better software engineering practices by making better use of abstraction. Despite requiring slightly more code and classes, it would still be better than "Alternative 1" which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle as the parser class would have to be changed for changes in tiebreak methods in addition to changes in methods of parsing.

===== Aspect: How to separate tiebreak methods

* *Alternative 1:* Each tiebreak method preceded by a new tiebreak prefix ("tb/")

** Pros: Follows the paradigm followed by other commands.
** Cons: Very tedious for the user to type and adds difficulty in parsing.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Each tiebreak method separated by a single whitespace

** Pros: Easier to implement and more convenient for the user to type as well. Code-wise it is easy and quick to customize which character to separate methods on.
** Cons: Introduces a slight variation as other commands don't use whitespaces as separation methods which might confuse the user.

To better consider the user's needs and convenience, "Alternative 2" was selected. So as to not confuse users, this implementation has been made abundantly clear in the User Guide as well. From a developer's perspective, this implementation is also more customizable to better respond to changes in user's preferences as the separation character can easily be changes.

=== Find Command
Currently, Alfred allows users to view specific entities by their `ID` using the `view ENTITY ID`.
However, it may not be convenient for users to remember the `ID` of specific users, especially since
`ID` objects are randomly generated.

To help Alfred become a viable alternative to Excel, Alfred also offers an improved `find` function
that has been inspired by the power of Excel Macros.
`find` offers a search by a single field and multiple fields. The list of fields that can be searched for
for each entity can be found in the
<<UserGuide.adoc#finding-a-specific-entity-code-find-mentor-team-participant-n-name-code, user guide>>, or by
simply typing in an incorrect `find` command in the application.

The find command also offers an option to do a negative search of the fields in the list. This can be
done via the `EXCLUDE` keyword. All the parameters that come after the keyword will undergo a negative
search. Figure 41 shows an example of this. `find participant EXCLUDE n/uc` will look for all participants
whose name that does not contain "uc".

.Find Command User Interface
image::FindScreenshot.png[]

By default, Alfred does a search by intersection for the given entity. However, Alfred also allows
the user to do a search by union. This can be done by inserting an `OR` keyword before all the parameters.
Further examples on the usage of `find` can be found in the
<<UserGuide.adoc#advanced-finding-of-a-specific-entity-by-union-or-negative-code-find-and-or-mentor-team-participant-n-name-exclude-code, user guide>>
.

==== Find Command Implementation Overview

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of method calls used to display the filtered list
on the application, from `Logic` to `ModelManager` upon the execution of a `FindParticipantCommand`.
An analogous sequence diagram also applies for the `Team` and `Mentor` objects as well.

.Find Participant Command Sequence Diagram
image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The left half of the diagram covers creation of the `FindParticipantCommand` while the right half
details the interaction with the `Model`. There are 5 main steps in the execution of the command.

1. `FindCommandAllocator` allocates the correct parser for the find command based on the entity name
provided. If the entity name is incorrect, then an error will be thrown and execution will terminate.
This step is not represented in the sequence diagram to make it neater.

2. The `FindParticipantCommandParser` will then parse the String provided to it. If the string provided
is invalid and does not follow the specified format, an error will be thrown. Likewise, if the find command
is called and no parameters are provided, an error will also be thrown. During the parsing, the parser splits
the input string given into two separate strings, one for normal parameters and the other for parameters
that will undergo negated search. Two separate `ArgumentMultimap` objects are generated using the two
strings. These `ArgumentMultimap` objects are the same as the ones found in AddressBook3 and thus behave in a similar manner
and have the same constraints.

3. If there are no errors, the `FindParticipantCommandParser` then creates
a `FindParticipantCommand` which in turn generates the predicate it would use
to filter the relevant `EntityList` by. These predicates are stored as static variables in a central `Predicates`
file. `FindParticipantCommand` selects the predicates based on which fields are provided in the original
input string.

4. With these predicates, it then calls the `findParticipant` method on the model with the generated predicate.

5. A list of `Participant` objects is then returned, and is also printed onto the console for the user's
reference. Then, at `FindParticipantCommand`, a `CommandResult` is returned after the smooth execution
of this `find` operation.

[NOTE]
The find command does not mutate the list in any way. It only changes the `Entity` objects displayed using
the generated predicate.

==== Design Considerations

The following are some design considerations for the `find` Command Feature

===== Aspect: Format of the input string

* *Alternative 1*: Use a SQL style query string
    - Pros: SQL syntax is universally used to communicate with databases and is clean
    - Cons: Users may not be familiar with SQL

* *Alternative 2*: Use the current format of `n/NAME e/EMAIL ...` (current)
    -  Pros: Maintains consistency within the application
    -  Cons: It is not as clear as SQL style syntax


Alternative 1 would take the form
    of `find where name="John" and phone like "123" and not email="gmail.com"`. This would also have the added
benefit of better on-boarding SQL users. However,
while SQL-style syntax  is relatively clean and understandable, we decided not to implement this
for the following reasons.
The first reason was that SQL queries are meant to be used for large databases with thousands of columns,
hence, the structure of the query must be clean to reduce the number of bugs made in the query. On the
other hand, each `Entity` in Alfred only has a small number of fields (less than 6) and thus the current
query format would still be understandable. Secondly, as mentioned above, users may not be familiar with SQL.

Hence, Alternative 2 was chosen as it would be more
user friendly for users to the existing command format instead of memorizing a new format.
Furthermore, implementing a new format would take more time as
the new query format would have to be written and tested thoroughly, thus negatively impacting development
velocity.

===== Aspect: Storing of the predicates
* *Alternative 1*: Store the predicates in a central file (current)
    - Pros: Makes the predicates accessible to the whole application
hence reducing code duplication
    - Cons: A large conditional statement would be needed in each Command class.

* *Alternative 2*: Store the Predicates within each `FindCommand` class
    - Pros: Each predicate is only used by one class, so this would have resulted in a better separation
of concerns
    - Cons: A large conditional statement or hash map would still be needed to decide which predicates to
use

Ultimately, we decided to use Alternative 1. Although most of the predicates are only used once, they are
all unmodifiable functions that return a predicate in the form of a closure. Thus, the risks associated
with unrestricted access and modification of an object are greatly reduced. Furthermore, predicates are
also used in other parts of the codebase. Hence, it is a good idea to consolidate them in a single location.
Thus, if another class in the codebase needed to implement another predicate, all it had to do would be to check
this central file to see if a similar one was already written, as opposed to trawling though the entire codebase.

The large conditional statement was also not a major issue. This is because although it is large, the
code within was understandable and this would have facilitated its extension, as compared to prematurely
refactoring out into smaller submodules.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Product Survey

*Google Sheets*

Author: Google

Pros:

* This is extremely versatile as Google Sheets come with a list of extremely helpful macros that could help in the storage of participants.
* The display and UI of Google Sheets is extremely intuitive and will come as second nature to anyone using the web.
* Convenient and accessible by multiple HR personnel simultaneously.

Cons:

* Google Sheets has no concept of objects and thus it cannot accurately depict the relationships between our different entities.
* As above, it is hard to look for relationships between our entities, such as Team/Participant associations.
* Google Sheets may be useful for storing information, but it does not support command line arguments.
* Google Sheets is also unable to perform input validation as it lacks the logic to do so.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum. +
   _Note: If you are a OS X user, you might need to run this from your command line instead._

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

_{ more test cases ... }_

=== Deleting a Participant

. Deleting a Participant while all participants are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all participants using the `list participants` command. Multiple participants in the list.
.. Test case: `delete participant P-1` +
   Expected: Participant with id P-1. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete participant P-101212323` +
   Expected: No participant is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.


=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Prerequisites: Create a JSON with corrupted data, or any data at all
.. Test case: Start the application. Logger should  kindly inform you that the storage files
