== Introduction

NUStudy is an application for managing three kinds of informational material:
lecture notes, quizzes and revision tasks. Their primary purpose is preparing for exams
and tests in universities, but they can also be useful for refreshing memory,
particularly after a module has ended (the reliance of some computing modules
on prior knowledge is rather heavy).

Most of the work is done through a command line; the GUI merely displays
the results. The overall appearance is similar to a simple note-taking client.

== Quickstart

.  Ensure you have Java 11+ installed.
.  Download the latest `nustudy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the application's home folder.
.  Double-click the file to start the app (if this does not work, use `java -jar nustudy.jar`).
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. Some commands you can try are
* `listnote`: lists all lecture notes
* `addnote t/Title c/Content`: adds a lecture note with title "Title" and content "Content".
* `deletenote 1`: deletes the first lecture note
* `help`: open the help window
* `exit`: exits the app

[[Features]]
== Features

This section helps you navigate through the features and commands.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPERCASE` are parameters you supply e.g. in `addnote t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter
which can be used as `addnote t/TITLE`. Parameters can be provided in any order.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.

=== Lecture notes

==== Adding lecture notes: `addnote`
This is the basic command for getting your lecture notes into NUStudy. The `i/` field, if provided, brings up a
dialog where you can choose an image from your computer's file system; such an image will be displayed at the
bottom of the note. +
Format: `addnote t/TITLE c/CONTENT [i/]`

Suppose you want to remember what the order-7 triangular tiling looks like and its Schläfli symbol.
Type `addnote t/Order-7 triangular tiling c/{3,7} i/` into the command line. The file selection dialog
will pop up, and you can select the image from your file system. Once done, you will see the lecture note:

image::screenshots/addnote.png[]

It is fine to back out of the image selection dialog; an image can always be added later using `editnote`.
Your images are copied into the application's data folder, so don't worry about losing them –
you can always take them along.

==== Editing lecture notes: `editnote`
If your lecture notes need updating, use this command, providing arguments `t/`, `c/` and `i/` (at least one)
as you would do with `addnote`, but only those arguments you want to change. Providing `i/` brings up the same image
selection dialog like in `addnote`.

Images can explain a lot, but if you want to remove them, use `i/none` in your command, and the dialog
will not appear. Otherwise, if you back off from choosing an image (e.g. by clicking the dialog's
close button), nothing will happen and your images will remain safe and sound.

Multiple notes can share the same image, and you can overwrite existing images currently
in NUStudy with new ones sharing the same filename.

The index must be between 1 and the number of lecture notes inclusive. It is listed before the title of
each lecture note:

image::screenshots/index.png[]

Format: `editnote INDEX [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [i/[none]]`

==== Viewing lecture notes: `findnote`
Of course, what use are virtual lecture notes if you can't search through them? This command
displays those notes whose titles contain every word (space-separated, ignoring case) you provide
as arguments. +
Format: `findnote WORD [WORD]…`

==== Listing all lecture notes: `listnote`
This is like running `findnote` but with no arguments. It shows all your lecture notes in their unabashed glory. +
Format: `listnote`

==== Deleting lecture notes: `deletenote`
When your semester ends, surely you want to free up space on your computer so you can accept new notes
for the coming semester? This command deletes the lecture note with the index you provide. +
Format: `deletenote INDEX`

==== Clearing all lecture notes: `clearnote`
Finally, if you ever find a better application than NUStudy for your lecture notes, you can clear
them all. Your quiz questions and revision tasks will not be affected. +
Format: `clearnote`
// end::lecnote[]

// tag::question[]
=== Questions

NUStudy can also store different sets of questions and answers;
at your command, the system will prompt you to answer those questions.

You can also add a `dt/` field to get questions that you have done within that time period.
Typing any other non-statistics command will close this panel. +
Format: `overview [dt/START_DATE] [dt/END_DATE]`

=== Revision tasks

This section provides instructions to manipulate revision tasks. The revision tasks help you plan your revision of notes
and questions.

The diagram below shows how a revision task looks like:

image::UserGuideRes/TaskUI.png[]

NOTE: The revision tasks are not synchronised with the note and the question. Once created, the task content will not
change if you modify the corresponding note or question. For example, if you have added a task for note "An AVL Tree"
and then you delete the note or change the title of the note, the task still exist with the heading unchanged. We adopt
this approach because we would like to allow you to customise the task headings in *version v2.0* of the app. Therefore,
we disassociate the task from notes and questions once created.

==== Add a revision task for a note: `rn`
You can add a revision task for a note to the current revision task list with this command. +
The heading will copy the title. +
The GUI will display all tasks upon completing the command. +
Format: `rn t/TITLE_OF_NOTE dt/START_DATE tm/START_TIME` +
Example: +

1. Type `rn t/CS2103T UML diagram dt/01/11/2019 tm/0900` in the command input box, and press `Enter` to execute it
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/AddTaskForNote_command.png[]
+
2. The result box will display the message "Revision task added: [N] NOTE : CS2103T UML diagram by: 01 November 2019 09:00".
The task is added to the task list shown in the middle panel.
+
image::UserGuideRes/TaskCommands/AddTaskForNote_success.png[]



NOTE: You need to follow the format "dd/MM/yyyy" for START_DATE input and "HHmm" with 24-hour format for START_TIME
input. For example: "31/12/2019" to represent "31st December 2019", "0900" to represent "9am", "1400" to represent "2pm".

==== Add a revision task for a question: `rq`
You can add a revision task for a question to the current revision task list with this command. +
The heading will copy the question body. +
The GUI will display all tasks upon completing the command. +
Format: `rq i/INDEX_OF_QUESTION dt/START_DATE tm/START_TIME` +
Example: +
`rq i/1 dt/11/11/2019 tm/1500`

==== Remove revision task: `rdelete`
You can remove a particular revision task from current list with this command. +
The GUI will display the current list (all-task, done-task, not-done-task or overdue-task) view. +
Format: `rdelete INDEX_OF_TASK` +
Example: +
`rdelete 2`

==== Mark the revision task as done: `rdone`
You can mark a task as done once you finished it.
The GUI will display the current list (all-task, done-task, not-done-task or overdue-task) view. +
Format: `rdone INDEX` +
Example: +
`rdone 1`

==== View all revision tasks: `rlist`
This command displays the whole revision task list. +
Format: `rlist`

==== Clear current revision plan: `rclear`
You can remove all revision tasks with this command. +

This command displays the list of revision tasks that you have not completed. +
Format: `unfinished`

==== View overdue revision tasks: `overdue`
This task displays the revision tasks which you have not done but having passed the start time. +
Format: `overdue`

==== Enable push notification: `notify -e` `[coming in v2.0]`
You can enable the push notification feature to send a desktop reminder when the task is about to start. +
Format: `notify -e [-A]`

==== Disable push notification: `notify -d` `[coming in v2.0]`
You can disable the push notification with this command. +
