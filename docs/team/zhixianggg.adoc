Hi! I am Zhi Xiang, a Year 2 Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
Below is a summary of my contributions to this project.

== PROJECT: Seller Manager Lite

== Overview

For our module CS2103T: Software Engineering, my team and I were tasked to enhance a desktop address book application called AddressBook.

We eventually turned it into a product called Seller Manager Lite (SML), which aims to help small-scale handphone resellers manage their sales and inventory with ease.
Users interact with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI) and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has more than 15,000 lines of code.

My role was being in charge of the Logic component, implementing the commands and parsers for Customer, Phone and Order data.
Also, I was tasked to implement undo/redo, find (search) and copy commands.



== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: https://github.com/yamgent[yamgent] - I adapted some of his code to implement the UndoRedoStack and fixed the bugs that came with his approach.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added the ability to create/read/update/delete customer, phone and order.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added find command(s) that allows the user to search for customers, phones or orders that match certain keywords.
This required enhancing the existing find command.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added copy command(s) that allows the user to copy the data that they want onto their clipboard.
This would make it convenient for them to copy data out of the application.


* *Code contributed*:

* contributed more than 11,000 lines of code (LoC):
