    "description": "This module introduces students to fundamental data structures, their implementation strategies, their algorithm design, and their applications. Data structures covered include linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, heap, trees, and graphs. This module also introduces the concepts of running time analysis and Big-O notation to quantify the performance of different implementation strategies and algorithms.",
