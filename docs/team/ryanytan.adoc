== Project Portfolio for Ryan Tan

=== About the Project

Jarvis was developed by {gh_team}[AY1920-CS2103T-T10-1]. We are a team
based in the {nus_comp}[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

My team of 5 students in a Software Engineering module, including myself, was
tasked with enhancing a program named {nus_ab3}[AddressBook]. AddressBook is
a basic desktop application that features a Command Line Interface (CLI)
style of input - meaning that a mouse is used minimally in the application.

We chose to enhance AddressBook into a Student Lifestyle application named
**Jarvis**. Jarvis is meant to be able to manage many aspects of a regular
university student's life - anywhere from finances to university course
planning.

Shown below is the UI of Jarvis, showing my feature:

.User Interface of Jarvis

My role in the development of Jarvis was the Course Planner feature. This
document illustrates the methods I've used to integrate this feature into
Jarvis, along with the challenges I have faced, plus any other contributions I
had in the entire project.

The link to the repository can be found {gh_team}[here].

=== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of coding, documentation, and other helpful
contributions to this team project. The link to the code I have contributed
can be found at {misc_codecontributed}[this link].

==== Course Planner

The feature I have provided within Jarvis is a **Course Planner** - using this
feature you are able to plan out, look up and check information about any
course currently offered within the National University of Singapore. This is
one of the big features (out of 4) of Jarvis.

Since Jarvis is an integrated system with the focus of a Student Lifestyle
tool targeted towards University students, streamlining course planning
was determined to be a natural feature that this application should provide.
The Course Planner allows an NUS student to keep track of their courses that
they have taken and the courses they are taking, so that they can make
more informed choices on the courses they wish to taken.

The implementation of this feature was not as simple as expected. This is
due to:

1. Implementing a new {misc_tree}[tree] data structure that I had not learnt
before in previous modules. Thus, research had to be done on how to
create this data structure. I eventually had to come up with my own
implementation using the new knowledge gained from my research.

2. Management of the large amount of data from University courses proved
challenging as many approaches could be taken to manage the data. This is
mainly in terms of the data's storage and retrieval while the app was
running, where a poor solution could result in program freezes in the order of
seconds, which would be detrimental to the user experience.
+
Eventually, a reasonable solution the problem was reached after considering
a few avenues, that was relatively neat and had good performance.

===== Credits
* {credit_nusmods}[NUSMods API]
+
Majority of the data used inside the Course Planner was downloaded directly
from NUSMods.

* {credit_jackson}[Jackson JSON API]
+
Processing of `.json` files were handled by the Jackson JSON API.

==== Other Contributions

This sums up my contributes to the project that were not directly related to
my main feature - Course Planner.

* *Developer Guide* {pr_dg1_156}[#156] {pr_dg2_159}[#159] {pr_dg3_169}[#169]
{pr_dg4_177}[#177] {pr_dg5_178}[#178] {pr_dg6_349}[#349] {pr_dg7_365}[#365]
+
I was in charge of the Developer Guide, and hence did most of the formatting,
editing and management of the document.

* *Testability and Code Quality*

** Refactored a `ModelStub` class that was being duplicated throughout the
codebase {pr_modelstub_refactor_131}[#131]
+
`ModelStub` is a stub class used for testing. As we developed our
own features, any updates to `Model` had to be reflected in `ModelStub`. Since
we had five different features, each changing `Model`, we had to edit every
instance of `ModelStub` in the code. Eventually, it got very tiresome and
I removed all static inner-class instances and refactored it into its own
class for easier reuse.

** Added additional compiler flags into our `gradle` build
{pr_modifybuildgradle_108}[#108].
+
This was added as some of us had pushed code that was using deprecated API.
This change allowed the compiler to warn us if we were using deprecated API,
along with any warnings related to Java Generics.

** Refactored `CliSyntax` {pr_refactorclisyntax_110}[#110]
+
`CliSyntax` is a class used to indicate different inputs into a command. So, in
a command with the syntax `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `n/` and `p/` are
considered "CLI Syntax". Our team faced an issue where we had to reuse
some syntax since similar ones thematically fit into our own individual
features. For easier referencing and to avoid clashes, the team lead asked me
to refactor the relevant constants into their own static classes for easy
importing.

* *User Interface*

** Implemented switching using `<TAB>` {pr_tabswitching_b832}[b832] {pr_tabswitching_4d9f}[4d9f]
+
Since Jarvis primarily uses the keyboard, I implemented tab-switching using
the keyboard with the `<TAB>` key, instead of having to either type a command
or use the mouse. I felt that this made the user experience more seamless and
in line with the target audience's (fast typists used to a Command Line
Interface) preferences.

** Implemented Command-Box highlighting {pr_commandboxhilite_8cf0}[8cf0]
+
The colour scheme we had gone with in Jarvis did not allow us to highlight the
text of wrong commands without it looking unappealing. Thus, I made the UI
show a red highlighted box instead, as shown below:
+
.Command Box Highlighting with Wrong Command
image::ryanytan-CommandBoxHighlight.png[500,400]

** Implemented `<ENTER>` to focus {pr_entertofocus_f84c}[f84c]
+
In an attempt to streamline the user experience even further, I implemented
pressing `<ENTER>` to automatically focus on the command box. This means that
the user will not have to use their mouse to click the command box.

** Implemented Styling for User Interface {pr_ui_330}[#330]
+
Along with the help of another team member who worked on the layout, I did
the styling seen in the application - such as the way the tabs look, the
colour scheme of individual components and general look and feel of the UI.

==== Contributions to User Guide

We were put in charge of our own sections of the User Guide content while
another member had styled and verified the cohesiveness of the User Guide as a
whole. The following is a small excerpt of my section in the User Guide:

'''

=== Course Planner

Unable to keep track of what modules you have been taking? Need to quickly
know what your CAP is? Want to know how far you are in determining your
focus areas? Jarvis has a feature just for you! The Course Planner serves to
solve these problems.

Let's see how the Course Planner looks like:

.GUI for the Course Planner
image::ug/CoursePlannerUI.png[]

The default display for the Course Planner is a list of courses on the left and
an empty Result Box on the right - as shown in Figure 12. This box will display
different pieces of information depending on the commands entered.

Let's see what the Course Planner can do:

==== Look up a course's information: `lookup`
You can also retrieve information about a specific course - such as course
title, course code, number of credits and what the course is about. The
information will be displayed in the result box on the right of the Course
Planner, as shown below:

.Display for lookup
image::ug/lookup.png[]

Any information you will want to know about any course is shown within the
result box.

Format: `lookup c/COURSECODE`

===== Example
----
lookup c/CS1010
----

'''

==== Contributions to Developer Guide

As stated above, after the assigning of roles amongst the team, I was put
in charge of the Developer Guide. While each person wrote their own sections,
I was to audit them and the relevant diagrams to ensure that they conformed to
the specified format so as to give the document both structure and cohesion.

===== Course Planner Section

The following is an excerpt for my own section of the Developer Guide. Some
of the sections have been stripped down to accommodate the page limit.

=== Course Planner feature

==== Overview
The Course Planner feature allows the user to track what courses they have
taken, are taking, and want to take.

The feature offers updated information on courses offered by NUS, along with
convenient add, delete and check operations on the user's course list.

==== The Course Planner Model

The `CoursePlanner` class within the model provides an interface between the
components of the feature and the updating of the overall model.

Some of the more interesting methods within `CoursePlanner` are shown below:

* `Model#addCourse(Course)` - Adds a course to the user's list
* `Model#deleteCourse(Course)` - Deletes the course from the user's list
* `Model#lookUpCourse(Course)` - Looks up information about the given course
* `Model#checkCourse(Course)` - Checks if the user can take this course
* `Model#hasCourse(Course)` - Checks if the given course exists in the user's
list

The list of courses of the user is stored internally using a `UniqueCourseList`
object, providing an abstraction with `add` and `delete` operations that
are called by `CoursePlanner` and its model.

The text that is displayed to the user within the UI showing information about
the Course Planner is abstracted within the course text display. The class
uses `Observable` to track changes as the program runs.

Shown below is the Class diagram for the Course Planner.

==== Design Considerations

This section will discuss about the individual components that were created
for this feature, the alternative Software Engineering design choices for each
one, and our thought process of the eventual choices made for each component.

===== And-Or Tree

The `AndOrTree<R>` is a tree data structure served by the `util/andor` package
that provides an abstraction for processing the prerequisite tree.  The
prerequisite tree (henceforth referred to as `prereqTree`) is an attribute of a
`Course` that is available in the NUSMod's course data-set, the data comes in
the form of a `String` and will be covered shortly.

Before covering the tree itself, it would be helpful to cover its building
blocks.

====== The `AndOrNode` Class

Each node in the tree of type `R` is represented by an `AndOrNode<R>`. Every
node has a `List<AndOrNode<R>>`, to be used in checking the truth condition
of the tree, and every node is either an `AndNode`, `OrNode` or `DataNode`
node. This determines the conditional used to check the truth condition of a
node.

The truth condition of a node is determined using the method:
`boolean fulfills(Collection<R>)`. This checks the truth condition of the node
based on the following predicates:

1. The node is an `AndNode`
+
Any subset of elements in `Collection<R>` must match all children of this
node.

2. The node is an `OrNode`
+
Any element in `Collection<R>` must match at least one of the children of this
node.

3. The node is a `DataNode`
+
Any element in `Collection<R>` must match the data stored in this node.

So, an `AndNode<String>` with children `{"1", "2", "3"}` will match `true`
against a collection of `{"1", "2", "3", "4"}` and `false` against a collection
of `{"2", "3"}`.

====== The `AndOrTree` Class

The following are `public` methods in `AndOrTree`.

* `buildTree(String, Function<String, ? extends R>)`
+
Builds a tree from the given jsonString. `Function` is a mapper that processes
a `String` and returns a value of type `R`, where `R` is the type of data
stored by each node in the tree.

* `fulfills(Collection<R>)`
+
Checks if the given `Collection` of type `R` fulfills the condition specified
by this tree. `AndOrNode` has its own corresponding `fulfill` that checks its
children or data against `Collection`.

Due to the arbitrary ordering of the tree, `insert()` and `delete()` operations
commonly found in implementations of ordered trees are difficult to implement.
Instead, the tree is fully created upon the call to `buildTree()` and is then
enforced to be immutable once built. This is reflected in the class' lack of
mutator methods.


====== Building of the `AndOrTree`

As mentioned above, we use the `prereqTree` attribute in order to build the
tree. An example of a json string is as such:

----
"prereqTree": {
    "and": [
        {
            "or": [
                "CD1111",
                "XY2222"
            ]
        },
        "EF3333"
    ]
}
----

This can be read as:

----
To take AB1234, you require...
 |
 └ all of
   ├── one of
   |   ├─ "CD1111"
   |   └─ "XY2222"
   └─ "EF3333"
----

This means that to take the fictional course `AB1234`, a user would have to
complete `EF3333`, **and** either `CD1111` or `XY2222`.

The Jackson API uses this string to create a root `JsonNode` object, and the
tree is built recursively from the root. The sequence diagram of the tree
building process is shown below:

.buildTree() Sequence Diagram
image::ryanytan-AndOrSequenceDiagramSimplified.png[]

The class looks at each node - checks if its is an `Object`, `Array` or a
`String`, and does the appropriate actions and function calls.

====== Dependency on Course

`AndOrTree` posed some difficulty for us, in the decision to couple the
implementation of `AndOrTree` with `Course`. This is because the tree will
only ever be used by the Course Planner within the program, and thus it is
not required to implement the tree using generics. Below are our considerations
in implementing this data structure:

* **Option 1: Couple `AndOrTree` to `Course`**
+
This means that there is no need to pass any mapper function into the
`buildTree()` method as the class does not need to know how to map from `String`
to `R`. This also makes handling mapping exceptions easier as they can be
handled directly by `Course` instead of by `AndOrTree`.
+
However, this increases coupling between the tree and `Course`, which reduces
testability of `AndOrTree`. The tree
will also only be locked to `Course` and is non-extendable.

* **Option 2: Using Generics**
+
This makes the tree reusable in the future. The tree will also
be able to store any data-type which allows for easier unit testing, since
it won't be dependent on the correctness of `Course`. Instead, well-tested
libraries such as Java's `String` API can be used to test the class instead.
+
However, due to how the tree is built, a
mapper function must be passed into the `buildTree()` method to process
the string in each node to the generic type of the tree.

====== Our Thoughts

Due to its benefits far outweighing its disadvantages, we picked the second
choice of using generics. While extendability and re-usability of the class is
a nice bonus, the decrease in coupling and increase in testability was the
deciding factor in choosing between these two approaches.

==== Implementation

The `check` operation allows users to check if they are able to take a certain
course. Whether the user can take the course depends on the courses in their
list. The following is the activity diagram of general overview of the process
when the user types a `check` command.
