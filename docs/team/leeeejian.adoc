== PROJECT: SecureIT
== Overview
---
Nowadays, digital is just how business gets done. Employees are more connected, and on more apps and websites than ever before.
However, this transformation has also made managing their digital life that much more complex.
Many times, workers end up practicing bad and unsafe security habits (e.g. reusing the same password for all their various accounts).

My group and I realised this problem, and hence set out to tackle this issue by creating **SecureIT**.
SecureIT is a morphosis of the desktop addressbook application provided to us to enhance for our software engineering project.

SecureIT is designed to be your all-in-one management tool for all confidential information, and boasts management capabilities for:

* Password | Secret Files | Secret Notes | Credit cards

SecureIT targets workers in small and medium enterprises, as well as those in startups, where security enforcement tends to be looser.

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section acts as a summary of my contributions to SecureIT._
|===
* *Major enhancement: the ability to analyse the level of security of the users' passwords.*

** What it does: The password analysis feature provides the ability to evaluate the security level of each of the user's passwords from six unique aspects. Following which, users are able to view a either (i) a *summary report* for *all* passwords, or (ii) a *detailed report* for a *specific* password.
The six aspects are:


** Justification: This feature greatly improves the utility of SecureIT because it can provide users with insight as to how secure their passwords really are in, and in a simple, hassle-free, human-readable way.
Each analysis aspect allows the user to identify different weaknesses in their password and thereby make the necessary corrections to ensure the security of each account.

** Highlights: It was highly challenging to implement the analysis feature. Some of the key highlights include:

*** Design: The design of the entire analysis component follows that of a *Command Pattern*. This greatly increases the extensibility of the analysis feature to accommodate even more types of analysis aspects in the future.
Also, careful consideration was needed to design and encapsulate the various objects used in the entire analysis feature. (e.g. Analyser, Result, Match, AnalysisReport)
*** Data structure and algorithms: The implementation of the various analysis aspects proved highly complex. Algorithms included the use of more complex concepts such as recursion and multiple pointers.
The implementation also required knowledge on the use of more complex data structures such as TreeMaps and HashMaps in order to help boost the efficiency of the product.

** Credits: [https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity/blob/master/src/main/java/net/ricecode/similarity/LevenshteinDistanceStrategy.java[Levenshten-Distance algorithm]]
* *Major enhancement: the ability to generate random passwords.*

** What is does: The password generation feature provides the ability to generate customisable and truly random passwords whenever they users a new password.

** Justification: This feature greatly improves the utility of SecureIT because it alleviates the user of needing to think of a password, and guarantees that the password provided is random and thereby secure.

** Highlights: It was challenging to implement truly random password generation.
In-depth research was required on how best to generate truly random passwords.
The generation of passwords leverages on the `java.security.SecureRandom` API for a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) to make the password generation as random as possible.

* *Other contributions:*

** Team contributions:
*** Implemented the method to copy text into the user's local clipboard, which was subsequently used by my teammates in the copy features they implemented. (examples: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CopyCardNumberCommand.java[1], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CopyPasswordValueCommand.java[2], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CopyUsernameCommand.java[3])
*** Reported bugs and offered suggestions for teammates. (examples: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/189[#189], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/190[#190])
*** Reviewed Pull Requests (with non-trivial review comments):
** Project management:
*** Helped decide the timeline for the project what to acheive in various stages
*** Created and assigned issues to achieve for each milestone in the lead up to the project submission. (examples: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/29[#29], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/28[#28], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/26[#26])
** Documentation
*** Made cosmetic improvements to the existing User Guide by creating the project logo.
