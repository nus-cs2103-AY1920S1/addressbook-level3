== Introduction

Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. Mortago is optimized for efficient mortuary managers who *prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Mortago provides a *convenient dashboard* for the mortuary manager to keep track of all bodies and fridges, outstanding
tasks, and notifs. It replaces and improves upon the traditional whiteboard system. Mortago allows the mortuary
management
to be more accurate in managing tasks, calculating the availability of space, viewing archives and generating reports automatically.

Interested? Refer to <<Quick-Start>> below to get started. Enjoy!

[[Command-Specifications]]
== Command Specifications

Before diving into the features that Mortago has for you, you will need to know several key information on how to use Mortago. The following sections will elaborate on these key information, such as the general format for commands in Mortago.

=== Command Format

Most commands in Mortago follow the general format: `COMMAND_WORD -FLAG ATTRIBUTES`

* `COMMAND_WORD` specifies what you want Mortago to do.
** eg. `add` will tell Mortago to create an entry according to the details that you supply in the later half of the command.
* `-FLAG` specifies what type of entity in Mortago you are referring to.
** There are 3 types of entities in Mortago: worker, body and fridge. Each of them has its respective `-FLAG`, given below:
*** `-w` indicates a worker
*** `-b` indicates a body
*** `-f` indicates a fridge
* `ATTRIBUTES` specifies the information about an entity that you need to supply for the command to be executed successfully. The following section will elaborate more on what `ATTRIBUTES` are in Mortago.

=== Attributes

|===
a|
[TIP]
What are `ATTRIBUTES`?
a| Attributes are properties of a worker, body or fridge that are supplied by you when executing a command.

For example, `name` is an attribute for both body and worker entities.

The full list of attributes for each entity can be found in <<add, Section 3.1.1>>.

|===

Here are some information that you will need in order to interpret the various command formats in this User Guide.

* You will find that `ATTRIBUTES` in this User Guide are represented with the format: `/attributeName attributeValue`
** You should always provide the `/attributeName`, exactly as it is stated in the User Guide, before specifying the details of the `attributeValue` that the entity has.
** For example, date of births in Mortago are represented using `/dob dateOfBirth`. Therefore, the `/attributeName` is `/dob` and `attributeValue` is `dateOfBirth`. If you wish to specify an entity born on 12 December 2000, you should key it as `/dob 12/12/2000`.

* You may find that some `ATTRIBUTES` can only accept specific values, or that these values must follow certain format. You can refer to <<Valid-Values, Appendix 7.1>> for the full list of valid values or format for these `ATTRIBUTES`.

* You must enter `ATTRIBUTES` successively in a single-line command. Mortago will not prompt you to key in any mandatory `ATTRIBUTES` that you may have missed out.

* You may provide `ATTRIBUTES` specified in a command in any order.
** For example, the following 2 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b (/religion religion /status status)`.
*** `add -b /religion Buddhism /status arrived`
*** `add -b /status arrived /religion Buddhism`

* You are not required to provide `ATTRIBUTES` contained in parentheses.
** For example, the following 3 commands are valid for the add command, with the abridged format: `add -b /name name /sex sex /doa dateOfAdmission (/religion religion) (/status status)`.
*** `add -b /name John /sex Male /doa 12/12/2011`
*** `add -b /name John /sex Male /doa 12/12/2011 /religion Buddhism`
*** `add -b /name John /sex Male /doa 12/12/2011 /religion Buddhism /status arrived`

* You must provide *at least one* `ATTRIBUTE` when `ATTRIBUTES` are tagged with `...` and contained in square parentheses (`[]`).
** For the filter command: `filter [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`:
*** `filter /name John` and `filter /sex female` are valid commands.
*** `filter` is an invalid command.


=== Identification Number

This section describes what Identification Numbers are in Mortago. This information is key in order for you to use Mortago effectively.

* All entries in Mortago have a unique Identification Number tagged to it.
* The identification number is automatically generated by Mortago for your convenience.
* Identification numbers in Mortago follow the format as shown below, where `#` is a number from 0-9:
** `body` entries: `B\\####\####`
** `worker` entries: `W\\#####`
** `fridge` entries: `F##`
* If you need to enter the identification number of an entity for a command, providing the number (e.g. `20` instead of `W00020`) is sufficient.

[TIP]
Default status: `UNOCCUPIED`

|===

[TIP]
Before specifying a `fridgeId`, ensure that a `fridge` with this id exists!

Example:

|===

| Command | Expected Output

a|
`add -w
 /name Mary
 /phone 87654321
 /sex female
 /dateJoined 18/08/2019
 /designation Autopsy Technician`


| Worker added

a|
`add -b

| Body added

a|
`add -f`
{nbsp} +



| Fridge added

|===
// end::add[]

// tag::update[]

[[update]]
==== Updating an entity: `update`

You can update the attributes of a body or worker by entering an update command with the given format below.. +

You have to indicate the entity type you want to update with a flag, as described in <<Command Format>>.
[TIP]
`-f` is not a valid flag for this command. Fridges are automatically updated when bodies are assigned or removed.

You can specify one or more attributes to change, but at least one valid attribute must be provided.

Format: `update -FLAG /id id [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`



When you update the `fridgeId` of a `Body`, changes to the fridges will be made as follows:

* Previous fridge's status is set to `UNOCCUPIED` and is no longer assigned this `Body`.

* New fridge's status is set to `OCCUPIED` and is assigned this `Body`.

When you update the status of a `Body` to `CONTACT_POLICE`, the `Notif` associated with the `Body` will be automatically deleted.

When you update `bodyStatus` to `ARRIVED`, a `Notif` pop-up will be shown after 10 seconds.


There are some attributes that you can update once the entity is created. For this command,
the list of valid attributes and their command prefixes can be found below:

|===
| Entity | Attribute

| Body
a|
Name `/name` +
Sex `/sex` +
NRIC `/nric` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date of Death `/dod` +
Date of Admission `/doa` +
Status `/status` +
Religion `/religion` +
Name of Next-of-Kin `/NOKname` +
Relationship `/relationship` +
Phone Number of Next-of-Kin `/NOKphone` +
Cause of Death `/cod` +
Details `/details` +
Organs For Donation `/organsForDonation` +
Fridge ID `/fridgeId` +

| Worker
a|
Phone Number `/phone` +
Sex `/sex` +
Date of Birth `/dob` +
Date Joined `/dateJoined` +
Designation `/designation` +
Employment Status `/status` +
Photo `/photo`

|===
[TIP]
Make sure you key in dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY.

Example: +
Imagine that someone (Jane Doe) just got promoted! You have to change her designation to 'Manager' in Mortago.

Instead of typing out all the irrelevant attributes a Worker has, you just have to input her ID number
and her new designation.

To update Jane Doe's designation: +
1. Locate her identification number on the dashboard. You see on the dashboard that her ID number is W00001. +
2. Type `update -w /id 1 /designation Manager` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it. +
3. The result box will indicate that the `delete` command has been undone. +
4. You will also see  on the dashboard that Jane Doe's designation has been updated.

|===
| Command | Expected Output

| `update -w /id 1 /designation Senior Autopsy Technician`
| Designation of Jane Doe changed to Senior Autopsy Technician.
|===
// end::update[]

// tag::find[]

==== Locating entries by name: `find`

You can find bodies or workers whose names contain any of the given keywords by entering a find command with the given format below. +

[TIP]
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`


Format: `find -FLAG [keyword...]`

Examples:

* `find -b John` +
Returns any bodies having names `John`
* `find -w Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any workers having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

// end::find[]


// tag::delete[]

==== Deleting a person : `delete`

You can delete a body, worker or fridge entry, using its Identification Number by entering a delete command with the given format below.. +

Format: `delete -FLAG  id`


[TIP]
When you delete a body, its associated notifications will also be deleted. If a fridge is occupied by a body, you cannot delete it.

* Deletes the body, worker or fridge entry with the specified identification number.

Examples:

* `delete -w 1` +

The worker with the identification number `W00001` will be deleted.

// end::delete

// tag::clear[]

==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

You can clear all entries from Mortago by entering a clear command given below.
Format: `clear`

// end::clear[]

// tag::list[]

==== List all entries : `list`
You can list all entries of bodies, workers, or fridges.

Format: `list -FLAG`

|===
| Flags | Usage
| -b | View all bodies.
| -w | View all workers.
| -f | View all fridges.
|===

Example: `list -b` +
After filtering specific bodies, you may now want to view the full list of bodies:

* 1. Mortago shows filtered list of bodies.

image::List1.png[]

* 2. Type `list -b` in the Command Line Interface (CLI).

image::List2.png[]

* 3. Mortago shows unfiltered list of bodies.

image::List3.png[]

// end::list[]

// tag::select[]

====  Selecting a body: `select`

You can select a body and view its full details by entering a select command with the given format below.

Format: `select id`

Example: `select 1` +

View a body with the ID B00000001.





// end::select[]

=== General

// tag::notifs[]

==== View notifs panel: `showNotifs`
You can view all notifications by entering a showNotifs command with the given format below.

A `notif` is automatically created when you could not contact the next of kin within 24 hours from the time
of arrival of the body. For the purpose of testing, this period is set to 10 seconds instead of 24 hours.
The `bodyStatus` will be automatically changed to `CONTACT_POLICE` if it is `ARRVIED` after the 10 second period.
A pop-up window to remind you to contact the police will be shown so that they can search for the body's next of kin.

Once you change the `bodyStatus` to any of the possible bodyStatus instead of `ARRIVED`, the `notif` will be be deleted.
If you change the `bodyStatus` to `ARRIVED`, the associated `notif` for the body will be added and the timer will start from the point in time it is changed.

Format: `showNotifs`

// end::notifs[]

// tag::sort[]

==== Sort all entries: `sort` `[coming in v2.0]`
You can sort all displayed entries according to a given order by entering a sort command with the given format below.

Only body and worker entries can be sorted.

The following describes the types of ordering that can be executed:

* `name`: entries are sorted by alphabetical order of their names
* `id`: entries are sorted by their id number, in descending order (newest entry appear first)
    ** `id asc`: entries are sorted in ascending order of id number
    ** `id desc`: entries are sorted in descending order of id number
         *** If neither 'asc' or 'desc' qualifiers are supplied, the ordering is by default descending.
* `status`: entries are sorted by their statuses in this order:

Format: `sort /order order`

Example:

* `sort /order status` +
All entries will be sorted and grouped according to their statuses.
* `sort /order id asc` +
All entries will be sorted according to their id number in ascending order.
// end::sort[]
// tag::filter[]

==== Filter all entries: `filter`
You can filter all entries according to the given keywords in any of an entry’s attributes by entering a filter command with the given format below.

All entries with matching keywords will be displayed. Keyword is case-insensitive.

All attributes of a body or worker entry can be filtered. If more than one attribute is specified, the entries displayed must fulfill all attributes. Please refer to <<Section 3.1.1>> for the different fields available to be filtered.

Format: `filter -FLAG [/attributeName attributeValue ...]`

Example:

* `filter -w /sex female` +
All female worker entries will be displayed.

* `filter -b /cod Car Accident /sex male` +
All body entries with car accident as the cause of death and those that are male will be displayed.
// end::filter[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing a command: `undo`

This command undoes the effects of the last command you executed.
You can undo up to 10 most recent commands.
The commands are undone starting from the most recent to the least recent.

Format: `undo` or `u`

The `add`, `update`, `clear`, and `delete` commands can be undone.
Commands like `list` or `find` cannot be undone.

Commands caused by automated commands, such as a `NotifCommand` can be undone and redone.
For example, the automatic status change of a `Body` from `ARRIVED` to `CONTACT_POLICE`  is caused by an `UpdateCommand` and can be undone and redone. However, note that this feature does not support
the `NotifCommand` itself. For example, if a `Body` was added and deleted before the `NotifCommand` associated with it has executed,
undoing the deletion will not restore the `NotifCommand`.

Though you can `undo` a `clear` command, note that you cannot redo any past undone commands after that.

Example: +
Imagine that you've accidentally deleted the wrong Body (John Doe) from Mortago. You can easily reverse that mistake with the `undo` command instead of adding John Doe all over again!

To undo:

1. Type `undo` or `u` into the command box.
2. Press `Enter` to execute the command.
3. Notice that the result box displays "Undid deleting this entity: <long descriptor of the body>" and John Doe is now back in the list of bodies.


==== Redoing a command: `redo`

This command redoes the effects of the last command you undid.
You can redo up to 10 of your most recent undone commands.
All commands that can be undone can be redone. (See <<Undoing a command: `undo`>> for how `undo` can be used.)

Format: `redo` or `r`

[TIP]
A command can only be redone if it has been undone before.

Example: +
Imagine that you've previously executed `undo` to undo deleting John Doe. You look at the data again and realise you've deleted the right thing after all!

Instead of manually deleting John Doe again, simply `redo` the command.

To redo:

1. Type `redo` or `r` into the command box.
2. Press `Enter` to execute the command.
3. Notice that the result box displays "Deleted this entity: <long descriptor of the body>" and John Doe is now absent from the list of bodies.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::exit[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

You can exit the program by entering an exit command given below. +
Format: `exit`

// end::exit[]
