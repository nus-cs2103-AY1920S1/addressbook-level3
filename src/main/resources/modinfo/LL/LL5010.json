    "description": "The course introduces students to the civil law tradition, principally the French civil law tradition (with occasional references to the German civil law tradition). The French civil law tradition has had a significant influence in a number of ASEAN countries (including Indonesia) and whenever possible the course will refer to provisions of the different ASEAN civil codes and laws. The course will give an overview of the tradition and will touch on a number of topics including private law topics. The approach will be systematic in the sense that the course will try to immerse the students in the civil law system as a whole and help them understand how the system works and is organized. The goal is to teach the students how to think like civilian lawyers, or at least to teach them how civil law jurist approach the law.",
