    "description": "The aim of this module is to introduce advanced topics in convection heat transfer. Students will gain a deeper understanding of convection and will develop the ability to formulate and solve convection related heat transfer problems. The topics include: conservation principles, fluid stresses and flux laws, differential equations of the laminar and turbulent boundary layer, integral equations of the boundary layer, momentum and heat transfer for laminar flow, momentum and heat transfer for turbulent flow, introduction to micro-scale convective heat transfer, heat transfer in micro-channels and micro heat exchangers, heat transfer in thin liquid films.",
