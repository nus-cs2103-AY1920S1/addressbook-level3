It continues to develop students\u2019 abilities in speaking, orally comprehending, reading, and writing modern Mandarin Chinese and, concomitantly, also serves to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the social and cultural issues facing China today. Students will be routinely drilled in reading and writing throughout the semester. Systematic discussion, debate, and presentation provide students with ample opportunities to practice and enhance their newly acquired linguistic skills and oral fluency.",
