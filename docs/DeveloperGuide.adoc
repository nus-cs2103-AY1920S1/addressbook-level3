[[Design-Architecture]]
=== TravEzy Architecture

.Travezy Architecture Diagram
image::TravezyArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
TravEzy is mainly a Common Line Interface (CLI) desktop application. Hence, users will just need to interact with the text UI to trigger responses from Travezy.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component extends out to many different pages in TravEzy which represents the features that it has. This includes:

* Calendar
* Itinerary
* Financial Tracker
* Travel Diary
* Address Book
* Achievements

[CAUTION]
The Calendar and Itinerary window work in tandem with each other. Due to their dependency, modification to one of the feature might result in the the other feature breaking.

The `UI` component,

* Facilitate the changing of scenes between different user interface for the different features
* Gets the requested page
* Changes the scene on the primary stage upon request
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::BetterLogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` gets the `AddressBookLogic`
.  `AddressBookLogic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `AddressLogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores the different model used for different packages inside Travezy
* stores a `UserPrefModel` object used to get and set user preferences
* stores a `AddressBookModel` object used to get data from the address book
* supply a `StatisticsModel` which is only evaluated upon request
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterAddressBookModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Features

[[Features-Calendar]]

TravEzy has several features which are listed below.
Each of these features have their own design and implementation logic.

=== Calendar

The calendar feature in TravEzy allows users to easily find a free duration of time to travel.

*Calendar Class Diagram:*+

image::CalendarClassDiagram.png[]

The above diagram shows that ``Calendar`` stores information about the state of the user's calendar, including information about the user's current view as indicated by ``currentViewOnlyMonth``.

image::ShowSequenceDiagram.png[]

The above sequence diagram shows the sequence of events that take place when a user calls ``show`` command. Do note that the above sequence of events are very similar to those for the other commands which extend ``Command`` class.

image::SmartSuggestActivityDiagram.png[]

The above activity diagram shows how ``smartSuggest`` command works.

=== Itinerary

The itinerary feature in TravEzy allows users to organize their events by giving a certain time they planned to
finish each event.

Current, the itinerary feature supports the basic commands of add, delete, edit and marking your events as done.
It also includes other more advanced commands such as search, sort and wish(TM).

[TIP]
Not sure what you should do during a certain duration of time?
Use the wish function in the itinerary and TravEzy will grant you three event suggestions based on your past entries.
These suggestions are
personalized for each user!

The itinerary feature implements the aforementioned feature based on the use cases below:

.Use Case Diagram of the Itinerary feature
image::ItineraryUseCaseDiagram.png[]

Due to the numerous features supported by the itinerary, it requires a complex structure to ensure that each input
by the user are cautiously parsed before giving the appropriate command result.

.Architecture Diagram of the Itinerary feature
image::ItineraryDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the itinerary feature.
Inputs given by the user are channeled from the text UI and parsed in the logic package before different commands
are formed which generates the model and updates the itinerary object which contains the event list.

[CAUTION]
The Calendar and Itinerary window work in tandem with each other. Due to their dependency,
modification to one of the feature might result in the the other feature breaking.

The `text UI`, `logic` and `storage` all stem from the common package of the main TravEzy application.
However, in the `parser` package of itinerary, it contains various parser objects for the different command.
This is to ensure that each command in the itinerary have only one parser validating the command.

==== Model Component

The implementation of the model class in TravEzy is to be a generic. Hence, the model object being instantiated
could be any of the following 5 features, `Calendar`, `Itinerary`, `Financial Tracker`, `Travel Diary`
and `Achievements`. Below is the model class diagram for the itinerary feature:

.Model Diagram of the Itinerary feature
image::ItineraryModelDiagram.png[]

The Model, is the crux of the itinerary feature which serves several functions this include:

* stores the Itinerary data which includes the event list which keeps track of all the events that are
included by the user and stores it into the storage in a JSON file.

* exposes an unmodifiable ObservableList<Event> that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* does not depend on any of the other three components, UI, logic and storage which are common through all the features
throughout TravEzy.

[IMPORTANT]
A plausible extension to the itinerary model is give users the ability to *tag* each of their events based
on different priority. This has ever since been implemented in v1.3

Alternative implementation to the proposed extension:

* Use javaFX drop down menu to only users to tag based on priority: +
+
PROS: Can use tagging as a search condition and easier for storage / maintenance purposes. +
+
CONS: Limiting the users to only a certain set of taggings.

* Allow user to type in tagging during the add command template: +

    add title/[title] date/[date] time/[time] l/[location] d/[description]
+
PROS: Allows the user to put in any tag they want to allow for more variety. Search function is still
applicable for tags but users would need to know the specific tag they used for that particular event. +
+
CONS: Harder to maintain the individual tags in the storage since there could be a lot of tags that
are being defined by the user.

==== Itinerary search command

The search command for specified events in the event list is facilitated by the `Itinerary` class which contains
an event list and keep track of the events that the user has inputted into TravEzy. There are several search conditions
available for the users to search from based on the different class attributes that form the `Event` class:

* search title/[title]
* search date/[date]
* search time/[time]
* search l/[location]
* search d/[description]

Given below is the _sequence diagram_ of how the Itinerary feature interacts with TravEzy when the search command is
being called.

.Sequence Diagram of the Search Command
image::ItinerarySearchCommand.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifeline for SearchCommandParser and SearchEventDescriptor should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The search command is implement as follows, upon giving the command by the user in the text UI, the command
will be channeled to the `Logic` class where it identifies it as a itinerary command and passes it to the `ItineraryParser`
class.

The `Itinerary Parser` passes through the command into a switch case block and identifies this as a `SearchCommand`.
This will create a new `SearchCommandParser` which will then accept the arguments from the user's input and parse the
arguments of the command.

Once the arguments are parsed and considered as valid, the `SearchCommandParser` will generate a new `SearchCommand`.
The `SearchCommand` will in turn create a "pseudo-event" known as the `SearchEventDescriptor` which is an event
which only contains attributes with the search condition while the rest of it's attribute will be placed as null.

This `SearchEventDescriptor` will in turn be returned and used in the `Predicate` field as the event in comparison.
The `filterEvents(e)` method will be called with `e` being the `SearchEventDescriptor` that is being generated. Events
that are currently in the event list will be filtered accordingly based on whether it matches the attributes in the
`SearchEventDescriptor`. Finally, the `filteredList` will be generated and returned.

The aforementioned steps could be easily summarized using an activity diagram when the user executes a
search command in the itinerary:

.Activity Diagram of the Search Command
image::ItinerarySearchActivityDiagram.png[]

The following search command is implemented in the series of steps as described in the activity diagram as shown above
is to ensure that validation of the arguments given in the user command first before the SearchCommand is generated.

Once the arguments from the user input has been verified, the "pseudo-event" created can help to proof-read whether
users have given any conditions for the search. It will return false if all the attributes in the `SearchEventDescriptor`.
Running through all the events in the event list will ensure that all the events are being considered in the filtering process.

This sequential approach in implementing the `SearchCommand` will ensure that all the current events are being looked through
based on the specific search condition and only the filtered list will be given as a result.

==== Future Extensions

As indicated in the user guide, there are several features which are yet to be implemented during v1.3 and even during
v1.4. These feature include the undo, redo and wish command which are supposedly included during the v1.3 or v1.4
of the TravEzy itinerary implementation. However, due to the sheer number of features that are already implemented
in the Travezy itinerary during v1.3, these features will be postponed to the next version instead. While implementing
the TravEzy, we have in mind to provide you with quality instead of quantity. Hence, after much consideration, these
features are left to later versions instead.

That being said, stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for these cool features such as undo-ing your previous action calls that
you have made in TravEzy itinerary, and if you happen to undo the wrong command, fret not since the redo command will
also be implement in compliment to the undo command so that you as a user can call redo and revert back the undo call
too! Lastly, there is this awesome feature in the upcoming which is the wish command, what it does is that TravEzy will
refer back to the user's storage and look through all the past events that the user has inputted in his itinerary list.
Then based on these information provided, TravEzy will suggest 3 events that are suitable for the user to consider and
add it into his current itinerary event list. These 3 events that TravEzy itinerary suggest will be something that the
user will definitely enjoy doing or something that the user has to urgently do. Since it is personalized for each user
and anaylzed carefully with the previous event entries.

Hope that you are excited as I am in all these cool features that are coming up in v2.0.

// tag::financialtracker[]
=== Financial Tracker
The _Financial Tracker_ feature in _TravEzy_ allows users to keep track of their financial expenses with appropriate categorized expenditure by different countries.

*Architecture:*

The Architecture Diagram given below explains the high-level design of the _Financial Tracker_ feature.

image::FinancialTrackerDiagram.png[width=600]

Inputs given by the user are channeled from the `textUI` and handled by `Logic` before different commands are formed which execute on
the `Model`. The `Model` will then update the `FinancialTracker` object which contains the expense list.

The `textUI` and `Log Centre` stem from the common package of the main _TravEzy_ application while ``Logic``, ``Model,`` and ``Storage`` all have similar architecture design with the other features (Calendar, Itinerary, etc.).

*Financial Tracker Class Diagram:*

image::FinancialTrackerClassDiagram.png[width=800]
The `Model` stores the `FinancialTracker` data which includes several `ExpenseList` each associated with a country that keeps track of all the expenses.

``Financial Tracker`` exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableMap<String, ExpenseList>` that can be observed. The UI is bound to the `Model` whereby the `Model` returns an expense list associated with the current ``Country`` of the `Financial Tracker` and updates when the querying `Country` changed.

[NOTE]
Each time a new `Country` is selected from the _Countries dropdown box_, the respective expense list will be returned for that specific country, this implementation is to ease categorising and sorting.

*Sequence Diagram example:*

The sequence diagram below shows the sequence of events that will take place when a user calls `Summary` command.

image::FinancialTrackerSummaryCommandDiagram.png[width=800]

The sequence of events are very likely to those of the other commands in _Financial Tracker_ feature.

*Activity Diagram example:*

The activity diagram below shows how `edits` command works.

image::FinancialTrackerActivityDiagram.png[width=800]



// end::financialtracker[]

=== Diary

==== Architecture of Diary

.Architecture Diagram for Diary Feature
image::DiaryArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* above explains the high -level design of the _Diary_ within _TravEzy_. Below, there is a brief explanation of each component.
The actual _Diary_ is represented as a ``DiaryModel`` in the diagram. This ``DiaryModel`` has the basic functionalities of a real _Diary_.
It can store multiple entries which can then be manipulated by the user. The exact functionalities are described in more detail in the *_Model_* section below.

`GUI` represents the Graphical User Interface through which users input their commands.

`DiaryLogic` is the main executor of Diary. It is composed of the ``Logic``, `DiaryParser` and `DiaryCommand`. After receiving input from the ``GUI``, logic triggers
the `DiaryParser` to `Parse` the input and output the matching `Command`

``DiaryModel``. As mentioned above, this encapsulates a _Diary_ and hence, the `Command` from `DiaryCommand` is implemented on this ``DiaryModel``

``Storage``. After the `Command`  has been executed, logic then stores the updated `DiaryModel`in `Storage`. Data is written to and read from the hard drive using `Storage` .

``Commons``. `DiaryParser` and `GUI` are derived from classes in ``Commons``. Diary Feature also utilises the `Log Center`


``JUnit Test`` contains the testing classes for the _Diary_.


==== Structure of Diary Model

.Class Diagram for the Diary Model
image::DiaryLogicClassDiagram.png[]


The above diagram is a Class Diagram of the ``DiaryModel``


``DiaryModel`` Encapsulates the _Diary_ and prevents users from tampering with the underlying structure of the _Diary_.
It contains the `DiaryBook`, which is the actual implementation of _Diary_.

`DiaryBook` is the actual implementation of the _Diary_.

It contains:

* ``DiaryList``, which is a collection of all the `DiaryEntries` in a list form
* ``Observable List`` , which exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<DiaryEntry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates upon any changes.
* ``Details``, which is a component of the _Diary_ to keep `DiaryEntries` private using username and password protection

This `DiaryBook` has the relevant methods to allow users to add, delete, find general and specific `DiaryEntries`, private and unprivate their `DiaryEntries` and also password protect their `DiaryEntries`.


`DiaryEntries`: This is the base component of the _Diary_, and encapsulates a single entry into a diary.

It contains:

* ``Title``, which refers to the title of the ``DiaryEntry``
* ``Date``, which refers to the date and time of the ``DiaryEntry``
* ``Place``, which refers to the place of the ``DiaryEntry``
* ``Memory``, which refers to the memory of the ``DiaryEntry``


==== Sequence of Find Command
.Sequence Diagram for the Find Command


image::DiaryFindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]


Above, we have the sequence diagram for the ``FindCommand`` in the _Diary_. In this case, we have taken the scenario of finding any `DiaryEntries` which contain the word "temp".

Process:

. Upon receiving the instruction from ``Logic`` to parse the input `find temp`, the ``DiaryBookParser`` begins parsing the input to match it (based on the _Command Word_) to the appropriate _Parser_

. In this case, given that the the _Command Word_ is ``find`` the appropriate _Parser_ is the ``FindCommandParser``, which is created and then begins to ``parse("temp")``

. This in turn creates a new ``FindPredicate``, based on the input ``temp``. This ``FindPredicate`` will be used to filter through the ``DiaryModel`` to get the matching ``DiaryEntries``

. With the ``FindPredicate``, a new ``FindCommand`` is created which is returned to logic and executed

. This execution leads to the ``find(temp)`` command being executed on the ``DiaryModel``, which returns the updated ``DiaryModel`` with the matching ``DiaryEntries``

. This model is then returned to the user in the form of the ``Command Result``, and is visible on the GUI in the form of a list of the matching `DiaryEntries`.


NOTE: The lifeline for FindCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


==== Logic of Unprivate and Unlock  Commands


Given the similar function of the 2 commands, ``unprivate`` and ``unlock``, there is a more detailed explanation of the differences between the commands below.


.Activity Diagram for the Unprivate Command

image::DiaryUnPrivateActivityDiagram.png[]


Above, is the logical flow for the Unprivate Command. In brief, it allows a user to unprivate any private entry *IF* there are no ``Details`` set. As a result, the command can be input like this:

``unprivate 1``

NOTE: `1` is the index of the Diary Entry which is to be unprivated

.Activity Diagram for the UnLock Command

image::DiaryUnLockActivityDiagram.png[]

Above, is the logical flow for the Unlock Command. In brief, it allows a user to unlock any private entry *IF* there are ``Details`` and the ``Details`` input by the user match the original ``Details`` set by the user.As a result, the command can be input like this:

``unlock 1 user/username password/password``

NOTE: `1` is the index of the Diary Entry which is to be unlocked and ``user/username`` and ``password/password`` are the relevant Details.


In summary, the ``unlock`` command is only to be used when the user has already set ``Details``. Otherwise, the user has to use the ``unprivate`` command to see private ``DiaryEntries``



=== Address Book

==== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::AddressLogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/address/logic/AddressBookLogic.java[`AddressBookLogic.java`]

.  `AddressBookLogicManager` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `AddressBookLogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `AddressBookModel` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `AddressBookPage` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
==== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::AddressModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/address/model/AddressBookModel.java[`AddressBookModel.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` data and `ReadOnlyUserPrefs`.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterAddressBookModelClassDiagram.png[]

=== Achievements

==== Logic Component
.AchievementsLogic Diagram of the Achievements feature
image::AchievementsLogicClassDiagram.png[]

The `AchievementsLogic` is responsible for generating statistics for the different components in Travezy

.  `AchievementsLogicManager` uses the `Supplier<StatisticsModel>` to supply the `StatisticsModel`.
. Getting the `StatisticsModel` from the `Supplier<StatisticsModel>` constructs a new `StatisticsModel` that gets the statistics data from a Model from another feature e.g. `AddressBookModel` that is visible within `ModelManager`
. `AchievementsLogicManager` returns the resultant data from the `StatisticsModel` that is lazily created.

The `AchievementsLogic` parses `Command` as well to enable navigation to other `Page` within Travezy.

.  `AchievementsLogicManager` uses the `AchievementsParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `AchievementsLogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the sequence diagram for generating the `StatisticsModel` lazily:

[NOTE]
The `StatisticsModel` is lazily created. Hence, the statistics will only be retrieved from each model only when it is evaluated when loading the `AchievementsPage` scene.

==== Model Component

.StatisticsModel Diagram of the Achievements feature
image::AchievementsModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `StatisticsModel`,

* is constructed from the statistics data from a model of another feature e.g. `AddressBookModel` during instantiation
* contains the statistics data that is generated from a model from another feature e.g. `AddressBookModel`
* does not depend on any of the models from other features / packages e.g. `AddressBookModel`
