== Logic component

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

== Statistics component

.Structure of the Statistics Component
image::StatisticsClass.png[]

.  `Statistics` contains an ObservableMap of `MonthlyList` class.
.  `MonthlyList` contains an ObservableMap of `DailyList` class.
.  `DailyList` contains an ObservableMap of `CategoryList` class.
.  These lists are populated when the guiltTrip() is started up and the content is retrieved from Storage.
.  Any added entries are updated in the `CategoryList` and `DailyList` classes.

=== Features
==== Data Presentation
===== Sort Command
====== Implementation
The sort command extends the Command class. It works on the SortedList by adding a Comparator to the List. By default, the EntryList is sorted by date.

. The user executes the command `sort typ/Expense s/ascending`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `SortCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `SortCommand` calls the `Model` 's sortFilteredEntryList to sort the list of entries.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("sort typ/Expense s/ascending")` API call.

===== ViewHistory Command
====== Implementation
The viewHistory command extends the Command class. It calls methods from the Statistics Manager which handles the calculation of the statistics and returns it to the user.

. The user executes the command `viewHistory typ/Expense`
.  `Logic` uses the `guiltTripParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `viewHistoryCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The `viewHistoryCommand` calls the `Model` 's generateHistory method which calls on the `StatisticsManager` generateHistory method to calculate the statistics for that type.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  `Logic` returns the `CommandResult` object.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Guilt Trip data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
