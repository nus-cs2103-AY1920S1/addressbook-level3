    "description": "This module explores Modern China in its transnational context. It focuses on the interactions \u2013 chiefly cultural, but also social, political, and economic \u2013 of China with the world beyond its borders. Topics addressed will include translations of literary and non-literary texts, Chinese foreign students abroad, institutions and patterns of cultural exchange, and the introduction of new things, ideas, and concepts to China. The aim of this class is to raise awareness that China is not a stand-alone unit, but has always interacted extensively with her neighbours, in the modern era more so than ever before. This module is taught in Chinese.",
