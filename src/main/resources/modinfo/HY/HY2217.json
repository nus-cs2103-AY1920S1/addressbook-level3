    "description": "No general war has been fought since 1945, but there has not been one year free of war since then either. That is the theme of this course: why has post 1945 warfare been limited yet chronic? By studying selected wars in their international, political and social context, this course will address that question. This course is designed for students throughout NUS with an interest in history.",
