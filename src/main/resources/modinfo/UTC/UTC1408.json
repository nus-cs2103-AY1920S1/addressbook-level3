    "description": "Technology is the creation and use of tools, techniques and processes to solve a problem or perform a specific function. In this junior seminar, students will explore and understand emergent technologies (informational, biomedical, assistive, instructional etc) and will seek to understand technologies from multidisciplinary perspectives. Students will pursue a specific area of interest (eg a specific new technology, and related ethical or legal issues) in-depth, and consider the potential implications of the widespread use of these technologies, both in advancing human progress; and the social, ethical and legal dilemmas they may pose to society.",
