== Summary of contributions

Out of the 6 different components of the _TravEzy_ application, I was responsible for the development of the
*Achievements* and enhancing the *Address Book*.

=== Major enhancement: +
The achievements component of the _TravEzy_ application. The achievements page generate statistics from the 5
different existing features: address book, calendar, diary, itinerary and financial tracker.

==== Navigating around the achivements page:

==== What it does:
Upon navigating to the page, the achievements page generates the statistics for each feature. Thus this allows you to
keep track of their progress within the application and provides a nice summary for each feature by looking at its
statistics.

For instance, if an input `delete 2` is entered in the address book, which deletes the 2nd person in the list. The
achievements page will reflect the following changes:

[NOTE]
Any recent changes in the other pre-existing feature of _Travezy_ namely: address book, calendar, diary,
financial tracker and itinerary will update the  Statistics inside the Achievements Page.To find out more what statistics are generated for each feature, you can look

====
By looking at your overall progress, this feature aims to:

* Motivate you to travel more during your free time
* Provide insights on your travelling habits
* Provide insights on your expenditure habits
====

==== Highlights
The *Achievements* feature is live and up to date to reflect the latest statistics for each feature. To find out

=== Minor enhancement: +
In the address book component, I added a country field to the person in address book.  +

image::AddressBookInterface.png[width=800]

==== What it does
When adding a person into the address book, you can specify the person's country. The contact's country will be
displayed in the _persons list panel_.

==== Justification
A traveller travelling to many different country would have multiple contacts from different foreign countries.
A specialized address book that specifies a country field for the added contact can better help to tailor to
travellers need to better manage their contacts in the address book.
