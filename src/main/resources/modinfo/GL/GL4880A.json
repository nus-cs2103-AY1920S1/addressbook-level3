    "description": "This course examines contemporary global cultural flows. Emphasis is placed on cultural forms and the production/circulation of identity through/within globalization. The goal is to raise questions about power, cultural interaction and change, and the nature of globalization through landscapes of popular/vernacular culture. The course will address debates concerning questions of globalization and identity, such as: What is culture? How and why does \u2018culture\u2019 circulate through material exchange? How and why do processes of globalization mediate the material exchange of culture, and how was this different than the era of \u2018national culture\u2019? Where is the \u2018location of culture\u2019?",
