    "description": "The final practical project in the Theatre Studies curriculum provides students with a structured and guided opportunity to research, develop and produce an original performance piece. Working in a group under the supervision of a guest director, students conduct independent contextual research and contribute creatively to the collaborative process. The performance will be shown to a public audience, and each student will offer a research presentation analysing the process, choices and outcomes of individual work in the context of the group project. This is an essential module for Theatre Studies major students, taken in Year 3 of a student\u2019s enrolment.",
