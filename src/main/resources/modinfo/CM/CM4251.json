    "description": "Preparation and characterization of materials form crucial and vital aspects of materials research. Highly developed instruments are now available to apply an interdisciplinary study to understand the structure-property relationship. This module provides undergraduates an introduction to modern materials characterization techniques which comprise surface analysis techniques, X-ray diffraction, microscopy, thermal analyses, mechanical tastings and spectroscopies.",
