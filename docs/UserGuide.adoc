== Introduction

EatMe is for students who are trying to find *cheap and good places to eat or hang out*. EatMe will help you manage places you have been to, and keep track of your experience and expenditure. More importantly, EatMe is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EatMe can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
