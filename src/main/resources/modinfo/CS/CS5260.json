    "description": "This module is a follow-up to CS5242 and covers advanced topics in neural networks and deep learning. This module explores the underlying mechanism of a variety of different types of learning models: unsupervised, semi-supervised, and adversarial learning models, that are not covered in CS5242. Topics may include: generative adversarial networks, adversarial machine learning, zero-shot learning, geometric deep learning, neural architecture search.",
