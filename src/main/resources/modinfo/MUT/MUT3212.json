    "description": "Modal Counterpoint focuses on the music of Palestrina and his contemporaries, which is a largely linear style. In this course, students will study how melodic lines create harmony, as opposed to the concept of yielding melody from harmony. A progressive and musical approach is taken in this course. It begins with the introduction of elements of style and an aural immersion. The course gradually proceeds from two-voice counterpoint to three, and even four-voice counterpoint. Due to the vocal nature of this style, compositional work would be complemented with in-class choral singing, and supported by interpretative analysis.",
