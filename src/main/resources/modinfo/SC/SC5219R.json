    "description": "Tourism is an important part of culture, society and the environment in the modern world. How have social scientists theorized about the role of tourism and its influence in the contemporary world? We will explore the history of the rise of tourism in the contemporary world and its rise as a type of 'ordering' that is integrated with other social, political and economic changes of the modern world. What role does tourism have in the lives of people in industrial and post-industrial society? We will explore what it means to be a 'tourist', and what being a tourist means in the social and culture life of contemporary society. What is touristic culture? How does tourism shape culture and nature in the contemporary world? What is eco-tourism? Is tourism a way of solving ecological problems in marginalized and degraded environments? What is tourism\u2019s relationship with power, inequality and morality? This course will explore tourism as an important lens through which to understand our contemporary global situation.",
