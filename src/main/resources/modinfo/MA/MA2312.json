    "description": "This module introduces the basic concepts and techniques of differential equations. The objective is to develop a competent working knowledge of the main concepts and methods introduced. It is designed for students who read a minor in mathematics or for those who are keen to pick up some mathematical skills that might be useful in their own areas of studies. Major topics: First-order differential equations. Linear differential equations of second order or higher. System of linear differential equations. Power series solutions and Laplace transforms.",
