    "description": "This class aims to continue to give students practice in translation and interpretation. The course will focus on two areas: linguistic issues (grammar, semantic meaning) which must be dealt with in both oral and written translation, and cultural issues where there is a need for creative approaches to various non-standard forms of language which are found in poetry, cartoons, advertisements, and certain types of interpretation scenarios.",
