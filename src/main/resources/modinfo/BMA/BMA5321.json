    "description": "The focus of this course is on the international financial environment where business firms operate and financial service providers compete, with specific reference to Asia. It is tailored to students interested in careers in international banking, international financial institutions, or with the finance departments of multinational corporations -- or anybody else for that matter who recognizes that a knowledge of international financial markets is essential to doing business intelligently in the Asian Region and indeed in an increasingly \u2018globalized\u2019 world. Since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis markets are subject to rapid institutional and regulatory change, against a background of dynamic shifts in relative economic growth among different parts of the world, putting great stress on the financial architecture that supports financial markets. The course aims at providing a deep understanding of the dynamic forces that shape policy, institutions and markets in the future.",
