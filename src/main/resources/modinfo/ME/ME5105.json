    "description": "With the advances in technological processes and the demand for high precision, the vibration levels that can be tolerated by new machines are getting lower. It is therefore critically important to have a thorough understanding of the nature of vibration, its spectral characteristics and shock response. The course will cover the important aspects of vibration as well as measurement techniques, interpretation and the means of controlling vibration and shock. The emerging technique of active vibration control will also be introduced.",
