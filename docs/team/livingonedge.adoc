== PROJECT: ɯeme

---

== Overview

ɯeme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, ɯeme is optimized for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users can view, tag, search, import and export a collection of meme. They can also create their own memes from meme templates.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *commands to stage, unstage, load, import and export memes* [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-3/main/commit/ce54203d886a948e62906bbacb7bedc3c89a54db[#77]].
** What it does: Allows the user to import their own memes into the application. It also allows for user to export memes from the application
to their own personal folder.
** Justification: This feature provides a platform for the user to manage memes between the application
and external directories. It allows users to firstly load their favourite memes into the application, delete unwanted
memes before finally importing them into the application. Conversely, the user can also shortlist or bookmark
the memes that they want to export by staging them, and then export them in the export tab.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires two additional list (export list and import list) to be added to the Model since the
memes in the export tab and import tab are separate from those in the memes tab. This makes the implementation non-trivial as
more commands need to be introduced to support the export and import tabs, which are different contexts from the memes tab.
For example, support commands such as edit, delete and clear commands have to be separately created for the import tab.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added a preferences tab for the user to view his or her user preferences of the application, which is configurable in preferences.json [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-3/main/commit/9984517448d90e019e7d6d68fa16e59122319325[#105]].
** Added Edit and Load commands for memes in the import tab [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-3/main/commit/5bcfa70c5681960bd0ba0e32f64afe79e2e23268[#128]].
** Added Clear commands for both export and import tab [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-3/main/commit/5bcfa70c5681960bd0ba0e32f64afe79e2e23268[#128]].
