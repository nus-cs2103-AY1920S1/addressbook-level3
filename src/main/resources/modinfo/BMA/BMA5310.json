    "description": "The objective of this course is to provide a thorough study of corporate governance from an international perspective, drawing from the perspectives of academics, regulators, practitioners and policy-makers. Corporate governance refers to the processes and structure by which the business and affairs of the company are directed and managed, in order to enhance long term shareholder value through enhancing corporate performance and accountability, whilst taking into account the interests of other stakeholders? (Corporate Governance Committee, 2001). The course will commence with an overview of corporate governance, factors giving rise to its importance, and an overview of the corporate governance mechanisms that help control managerial behaviour. Different models and systems of corporate governance internationally are compared and contrasted, and policy responses of different countries to corporate governance concerns are examined. The course will then examine specific corporate governance mechanisms and issues, including board of directors, board committees, auditing, executive and director compensation, disclosure and transparency, ownership structures, and also corporate governance issues in specific contexts, such as government linked companies, family owned companies, IPO firms, mergers and acquisitions, management buyouts, etc. Case presentations and discussions will be a critical part of the course. Practitioners, such as directors, will be invited to share their perspectives with students.",
