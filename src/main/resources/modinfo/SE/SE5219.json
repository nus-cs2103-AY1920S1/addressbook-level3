    "description": "Technopolitics refers to the strategic practice of designing or using technology for political goals. However, even as the design of technological artifacts and systems may reflect a variety of interests, the material and cultural power of artifacts and systems often exceeds or escapes those intentions making for a complex and uncertain social landscape. This module offers an overview of technopolitical interactions in Southeast Asia and a vision of Southeast Asia as a technological society. Issues to be covered include technological nationalism, development as technique, infrastructure, risk, climate change, the digital revolution, and bio-security.",
