Singaporeans have also become a people with a greater propensity to participate in the decisions that affect the nation. This module aims to encourage undergraduates to reflect on Singapore\u2019s post-independence history, imagine the kind of Singapore they would like to co-create, and deliberate on the ways to achieve the future visions they have for Singapore. All lectures will be mounted online.",
