    "description": "This 4000 level module introduces students to one of the most discussed fields of ancient history. New work on the ancient economy has called into question the communis opinio on the social structure of pre-modern societies, and is key to an emerging consensus on the very high degree of economic, social, and political complexity of the Ancient World. Using a vast range of diverse and fragmented sources, the course will further introduce students to all key epistemological issues of ancient history.",
