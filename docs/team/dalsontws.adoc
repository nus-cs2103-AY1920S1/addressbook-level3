== Introduction

This project portfolio highlights the contributions I have made in for my project, _KeyboardFlashCards_, also known as KFC.
A key part of our software engineering module in the National University of Singapore, we started off by morphing an address book
application into our very own product, a Flashcard manager using purely the Command-Line Interface (CLI).
This was a key requirement of the project, as we had to ensure users only utilise the application by keying in commands
exclusively using the keyboard. In addition, this is a desktop application, used only on a computer.

This is a 6 week software engineering project, where we worked in a team of 5 who are students from the NUS School of Computing.
Our team consists of 3 Computer Science sophomores and 2 Computer Engineering seniors (myself included).

Our finalised product, _KeyboardFlashCards_ is an educational tool that aims to make remembering things easy. We wanted
to provide an efficient way to study for our peers to NUS School of Computing. As such, we came up with an easy to use,
FlashCard manager using CLI for efficient and quick storage of important revision material to aid their study.

[NOTE]
This section explains certain information that require the user to take note of.
i.e. prefixes used in our application and what it represents, certain functionality of the command

[CAUTION]
This section is used clarify certain possible assumptions the user/developer might have when using our application.
These assumptions could result in errors and exceptions in the application.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of the personal contributions I had on our project. Contributions included enhancements to
the application with new major features, project management implementations and additions to the documentation
in the User Guide and Developer Guide.

* *Major enhancement #1*: added *the ability to store deadlines in a schedule*
** What it does: This feature allows the user to store specific tasks as deadlines.
The user can now add specific dates that are important to their study and revision i.e. exam dates, revision dates.
In addition, the user can have an overview of all upcoming deadlines by looking at the pop-up calendar.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user can now ensure they would not miss
important dates and can now allocate their study and revision schedule according to these dates.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: Credit goes to https://github.com/SirGoose3432/javafx-calendar[SirGoose3232] for the JavaFX Calendar GUI
which was adapted before adding deadlines.

* *Major enhancement #2*: added *the ability to perform spaced repetition of FlashCards*
** What it does: This feature allows the user to store specific tasks as deadlines that will be reminded to the user.
The user can now add specific dates that are important to their study and revision i.e. Exam dates, revision dates.
In addition, the user can have an overview of all upcoming deadlines by looking at the pop-up calendar.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user keep track of FlashCard questions that they
are weak at and be reminded to do these questions again.
important dates and can now allocate their study and revision schedule according to these dates.
** Highlights: This feature is not included by chance. I wanted to incorporate an effective study technique that is proven
to work based on research. I decided to implement spaced repetition as it was an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education[evidence-based]
learning technique.
** Credits: This feature is inspired by the theory of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve[Forgetting Curve] by
Hermann Ebbinghaus, who theorised that training in mnemonic techniques can help overcome speed of forgetting.
One effective way is the use of active recall, especially using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[Spaced Repetition].
I implemented a simple version of spaced repetition through rating of "Bad" FlashCards.
