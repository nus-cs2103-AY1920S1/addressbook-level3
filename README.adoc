With features to help you keep track of your items' expiry dates as well as to remind you of soon-expiring items, you will never have to worry about when your items are expiring again. Next time, you will be sure to eat that chocolate before it expires!

* It is a Java application that hopes to automate and simplify the tracking of soon-to-expire items, mainly intended for students living on campus.
* Xpire is an open source project that welcomes contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing to this project, head over to the <<DeveloperGuide#, Developer Guide>> to get started!
