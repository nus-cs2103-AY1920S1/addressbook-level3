With this design approach, waste can be eliminated, construction time can be reduced drastically and cost can be lowered. This course discusses the concepts of constructability and examines in detail the principles of DfMA from the perspective of manufacture and assembly. It also covers logistical considerations to realise just\u2010in\u2010time production and delivery. BIM and digital technologies will also be discussed.",
