== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: adding *the ability to add a template to the shopping list*
** What it does: allows the user to add items in a specified template that are not currently in their grocery list. The feature
is able to deal with duplicate items as well as exclude expired items when checking the grocery list.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by making it easy for the user to generate shopping lists without having to
check the fridge. In addition, the feature makes it easy for the user to generate shopping lists involving regular grocery items instead of having to add them one by one.
Users can also use it to store the ingredients list of recipes.
** Highlights: This feature is able to subtract the amount of each item already in the grocery list from the template item to be added into the shopping list.
In the case that the item to be added is already in the shopping list, the item amount is updated with the sum of needed amount and the previous amount recorded.
To complement this function, a UnitDictionary class was added in order to enable cross-unit calculations as long as the units were of the same unit type.

* *Minor enhancement*: added template list that allows the user to create and manage templates
** For templates: Add, Edit, Delete, Clear, and List templates in the template list
** For individual template: Add, Edit, Delete, and List items in a template

* *Minor enhancement*: added unit dictionary that keeps tracks of the unit types of items with the same name (note: non case-sensitive)
** Supports the ability of the app to carry out arithmetic functions on similar items with different units by checking that all items with the same name
have the same unit type. E.g. Volume unit type: ml, L or Weight unit type: g, kg, oz, lbs
