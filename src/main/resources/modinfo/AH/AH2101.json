    "description": "This module introduces students to art history both as a field of academic knowledge concerned with works of art (including painting, sculpture and architecture) and as a discipline with a distinctive methodology, vocabulary and theoretical foundations. The module surveys the main trends in the artistic traditions of Europe and Asia paying special attention to cross-cultural comparative analysis (i.e. how the human body and landscape are represented in different artistic traditions).",
