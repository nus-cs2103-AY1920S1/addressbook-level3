    "description": "Why should we study the downtrodden, the disempowered and the dispossessed in literature? Selecting Chinese-language narratives from various locales\u2014especially Singapore and Malaysia\u2014that feature 'strangers, outsiders and nobodies,' this course examines the portrayal of figures living in the social margins, and across the fault lines of class, politics, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion and language. It also explores the social imaginaries encoded in literary texts to reveal the values and anxieties of the societies we live in, thus facilitating a collective discussion on the importance of feeling for those we find unfamiliar. No knowledge of Chinese is necessary.",
