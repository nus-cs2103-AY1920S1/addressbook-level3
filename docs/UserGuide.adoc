== What is MooLah?

Welcome to MooLah, your perfect personal financial assistant.

MooLah is a powerful, hassle-free expense tracker, designed to boost your efficiency at managing your daily expenses.
With MooLah, you can easily monitor expenses under multiple budgets, compare expenses across different periods, set
reminders for future events... many more wonderful things to explore.
Equipped with natural language time format parser, MooLah understands what you type, just like a friend - no more rigid
date and time formatting.
With its exceptional autocomplete and prefix suggestion feature, MooLah is faster, smarter, and more intuitive than
conventional expense trackers.
Although a desktop app optimised for Command Line, MooLah has an elegant Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This is what MooLah looks like:

== Before We Start
//insert UG legend

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `MooLah-v1.4.0.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for `MooLah`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Make sure the window is not in fullscreen and there is some space below the textfield in order
for the autocomplete popup to show properly.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listexpense`* : lists all expenses
* *`addexpense d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-10`* : adds an expense named `Chicken Rice` to the expense tracker.
* *`deleteexpense 3`* : deletes the 3rd expense shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features
This section gives a comprehensive list of MooLah's wonderful features, and helpful tips on how you can master them
quickly.
====
*Command Format*

* Words in between `<` and `>` are the parameters which are to be supplied by you! +
  e.g. `add p/<PRICE>`, you will need to supply a value to be used as the `PRICE` such as `add p/2.50` .
* You don't have to input the parameters in square brackets if you don't want to. These arguments are optional, and you
may use them to specify more details.
** `addexpense d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<PRICE> c/<CATEGORY> [t/<DATE>]` means that both +
`addexpense d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food` and +
`addexpense d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-01` +
are valid inputs


* You may also enter parameters which have a prefix in any order.
** `addexpense p/2.50 d/chicken rice c/food` +
 `addexpense c/food d/chicken rice p/2.50` are both valid.
* However, for commands which require an argument without a prefix require that the argument be supplied immediately after the command word.
** `editexpense 1 p/2.30` is valid.
** `editexpense d/2.30 1` is not valid.

====


=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::undo[]
=== Undo and Redo
==== Undo the previous command : `undo`

Did something wrong? You can undo it.

However, do keep in mind that you can only undo commands that modify the data in MooLah, such as `addexpense`, `deleteexpense`, and so on.
Head over to <<Command Summary>> for list of commands that are undoable.

Do not worry if you forgot what you did a few steps back (it happens!). MooLah will display a short description of what
particular command it undid to help you confirm that you undid the right thing.

Format: `undo`

Example:
```
deleteexpense 5
undo
```
Result:
The deletion of expense #5 will be undone, or in other words, re-added to MooLah.
MooLah will then display the message `Undid "Delete expense with index 5"`.

// end::undo[]

// tag::redo[]
==== Redo an undone command : `redo`

You might hit one undo too many and wish to cancel that one undo. That's okay, redo will help you on that.

Similar to undo, MooLah will display a short description of the command it redid to you.

Format: `redo`

Example:
```
deleteexpense 5
undo
redo
```
Result:
At the end, expense #5 will keep being deleted (poor thing!). MooLah will also display a message `Redid "Delete expense with index 5"`.

// end::redo[]

=== Changing panels: `view`
While most commands will change the panel-in-view to the relevant panel, you may wish to manually go to a panel without
attempting to modify data. You may do so with the `view` command.

The format:
----
view <PANEL_NAME>
----
For example, you may execute the following command to view your Budget List:
----
view Budget List
----
****
These are the panels which you may access through the `view` command: +
- `Aliases` +
- `Expense List` +
- `Primary Budget` +
- `Event List` +
- `Budget List` +
- `Statistics` (see Note below!)
****

****
*Note*

1. Panel names are case-sensitive.

2. Statistics panel is not viewable until statistics have been generated.
----
view Statistics
----

----
stats
listexpenses
view Statistics
----
****


=== Generic commands
MooLah has 5 generic commands which behave differently depending on which Panel in the UI is being shown at the moment.
These commands are `add`, `list`, `clear`, `delete`, and `edit`. These generic commands differ from Panel to Panel.

For example, you are in the Expense List Panel, then the following command:
----
add d/chicken duck p/3 c/food
----
will be interpreted as:
----
addexpense d/chicken duck p/3 c/food
----

=== Natural language DateTime parsing
DateTime formats accepted are handled mostly by a third-party Natural Language Parser library, Natty, which supports human jargon.
Please refer to http://natty.joestelmach.com/ for documentation and more information.
[NOTE]
Natty naturally parses all datetime formats in the American format (e.g. MM/dd, MM-dd).
In MooLah however, we have modified the parser such that all formats are parsed in the international format (e.g. dd/MM).

=== Basic Expense-related Commands
==== Adding an expense: `addexpense`

This is MooLah's fundamental feature: you can add your expenses.

This is the format:
----
addexpense d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<PRICE> c/<CATEGORY> [t/TIMESTAMP]
----

****
* If you don't specify the time, your expense will be added with its time being the current system time.
* You should only input one of the following into the CATEGORY field: `FOOD`, `TRAVEL`, `TRANSPORT`,
`SHOPPING`, `UTILITIES`, `HEALTHCARE`, `ENTERTAINMENT`, `EDUCATION`, `OTHERS`.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addexpense d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/10-10`
* `addexpense d/Buffet c/Food p/250`
* `addexpense d/Chicken rice p/2.50 c/Food t/yesterday noon`

==== Adding an expense from NUS canteens' menu : `addmenuexpense`

This is what makes MooLah special for NUS students.
Shortcut your way on adding expenses for foods and drinks in NUS!

Currently, MooLah only supports just a handful of menu items, though. Head over to <<Menu Items List>> to see the
supported menu items. A more comprehensive menu list is on its way in v2.0!

Format:
----
addmenuexpense m/<MENU_ITEM> [t/TIMESTAMP]
----

Example:
----
addmenuexpense m/deck chicken rice
----

This will add a new expense that corresponds to The Deck's Chicken Rice and MooLah will automatically fill in
the description, price, and category for you.

==== Listing all expenses : `listexpenses`

You can list every single expense you have added into MooLah.

Format: `listexpenses`

==== Updating an expense: `editexpense`

Made a mistake? You can edit expenses too.

Format:
----
editexpense <INDEX> [p/<PRICE>] [d/<DESCRIPTION>] [t/<TIMESTAMP>] [c/<CATEGORY>]
----
Example:
----
editexpense 2 p/3.50
----
This will update the price of the 2nd expense in the current list to 3.50.


****
* Edits the expense at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

==== Locating expenses by name: `find`

You can find expenses whose description contains any of the keywords you inputted.

Format:
----
findexpense <KEYWORD> [<MORE_KEYWORDS>]
----

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `chicken` will match `Chicken`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Puff Curry` will match `Curry Puff`
* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `chick` will not match `chicken`
* Expenses matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. an expense with description
`Chicken rice`, and expense with description `Duck Rice` will both match `rice`
****

Examples:

* `findexpense rice` will show you all expenses with rice in their description.

* `findexpense chicken taxi schoolfee` will show you all expenses with either `chicken`, `taxi`, `schoolfee`, or a
combination of those in their description.

==== Deleting an expense: `deleteexpense`

You can also delete an expense from the expenses list in MooLah.

Format:
----
deleteexpense <INDEX>
----
****
* Deletes the expense at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

----
listexpenses
delete 2
----
Deletes the 2nd expense in the list of expenses, shown after `listexpenses` is executed.

----
listexpenses
findexpense chicken
deleteexpense 1
----
Deletes the 1st expense in the results of the `findexpense` command.

=== Basic Event-related Commands

Events are pretty similar to expenses, except that they denote potential expenses that they may happen in the future.
You should use this feature to keep track of future important events in your life that would require you to spend some money
(e.g. your friends' birthdays).

At launch, MooLah will remind you of your upcoming events. Any transpired events would also appear as popups,
asking you whether you wish to add these events as corresponding expenses.

image::TranspiredEventsPopup.png[width="790"]

==== Adding an event: `addevent`

Events share the same fields as expenses, so you add them the same way.

Format:
----
addevent d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<PRICE> c/<CATEGORY> t/<TIMESTAMP>
----
****
* Events are potential future expenses, so the `TIMESTAMP` field is compulsory and should contain a future time.
* You should only input one of the following into the `CATEGORY` field:
`FOOD`, `TRAVEL`, `TRANSPORT`, `SHOPPING`, `UTILITIES`, `HEALTHCARE`, `ENTERTAINMENT`, `EDUCATION`, `OTHERS`.
These categories are case-insensitive.
****
Examples:

* `addevent d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Shopping t/two weeks from now`
* `addevent d/Family buffet c/Food p/250 t/31-12`
* `addevent d/Bangkok plane tickets t/tomorrow p/200 c/Travel`

==== Listing all events : `listevents`

You can list every single event you have added into MooLah.

Format:
----
listevents
----
==== Updating an event: `editevent`

You can edit events the same way you edit expenses.

Format:
----
editevent <INDEX> [p/<PRICE>] [d/<DESCRIPTION>] [t/<TIMESTAMP>] [c/<CATEGORY>]
----

Example:
----
editevent 2 p/300
----
Updates the price of the 2nd event in the current list to be 300.


****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****
==== Deleting an event: `deleteevent`

You can also delete an event from the events list in MooLah.

Format:
----
deleteevent <INDEX>
----

****
* Deletes the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

----
listevents
delete 2
----
Deletes the 2nd event in the list of events, shown by `listevents`.

//tag::budget[]
=== Let's Do Budgeting

Feel a need to cut your spending? Try MooLah's awesome budgeting feature!
It can help you cultivate better financial management habits in the following ways:

* Each budget has a progress bar with a percentage (rounded to the nearest integer), which indicates how much you have
spent as a proportion to the limit.
* The color of the progress bar implies the following 4 status:
- *GREEN*: `0% - 49%` of the limit.
- *YELLOW*: `50% - 89%` of the limit (MooLah will notify you're halfway through)
- *ORANGE*: `90% - 100%` of the limit. (MooLah will remind you of the approaching limit)
- *RED*: `> 100%` of the limit. (MooLah will give a warning and advise you to cut down on your spending. However, the
percentage will continue to update even if you exceed the budget, to give you a better idea of how much you have overspent.)

NOTE: When the budget is exceeded too much (more than `10^7` times the budget
limit), you will not be able to add any new expense -- I hope that won't happen ;)

==== Create a New Budget : `addbudget`
Want your expenses tracked under a recurring budget? Simple enough with this command: `addbudget`.

The concrete format is:
----
addbudget d/<DESCRIPTION> p/<AMOUNT> sd/<START_DATE> pr/<PERIOD>
----

For example, after typing:
----
addbudget d/school p/300 sd/01-10-2019 pr/month
----
You'll see that a new budget `school` is created, and set to `$300`, recurring `monthly`, starting from `1 Oct 2019`.

NOTE: All expenses that do not have a budget will go under `Default Budget`, which is not deletable nor modifiable. +
Each budget must have a *unique (case-insensitive) name*. +
MooLah supports 4 types of budget period input: `day`, `week`, `month`, and `year` (all in *lower case*). +
The year in <START_DATE> is optional, i.e. you can simply input `01-10` and the year will be automatically set
to the current year. +
The <START_DATE> can be any time in the past or future, the budget period will *automatically
normalize to the current period*.
For example, if today is `23-10-2019`, when you type `sd/01-07 pr/month`, the resulting budget period
will be `01-10-2019 to 31-10-2019`, since that's the period anchored by today's date. +
All budgets are *recurring*. Continuing from the example above, on 1 Nov 2019, you'll see the budget's period refreshed
to `01-11-2019 to 30-11-2019`, and all past expenses archived, giving you an empty budget panel to start with.

==== Switch Between Budgets : `switchbudget`
Now that you've successfully added a few different budgets, wonder how to toggle between them? Try this magical command:
`switchbudget`, which switches the primary budget to any other budget in one click!

The concrete format is:
----
switchbudget d/<BUDGET_NAME>
----

For example, suppose you're at primary budget `school` now. After typing:
----
switchbudget d/outside school
----

You will see that the primary budget panel is switched from `school` to `outside school`. Every expense you add
from now on will be tracked under the `outside school` budget instead.

NOTE: There is one, and only one, *primary budget* in MooLah at all times. Every expense you enter automatically goes to
this current primary budget. If you wish to let an expense be tracked by a different budget, *switch to that
corresponding budget* first, before you add the expense. +
The <BUDGET_NAME> is case-insensitive.

==== List All Budgets: `listbudget`
To get an overview of all the budgets at hand, simply type:
----
listbudget
----
You'll see a list of all budgets in MooLah.

NOTE: The primary budget is marked with a *red border*. +
To go back to primary budget panel, type `view primary budget`.

==== Edit a Budget: `editbudget`
A typo? On a second thought? No worries, you can easily modify your budget with `editbudget`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudget (first go to list of budgets)
editbudget <INDEX> [d/<DESCRIPTION>] [p/<AMOUNT>] [sd/<START_DATE>] [pr/<PERIOD>]
----

For example, if the second budget shown in the list is `school`, recurring `monthly`, amount set as `$300`,
refreshed on `the 1st of each month`, after typing:

----
listbudget
editbudget 2 d/school expenses p/400 sd/05-10
----

It will change to `school expenses`, capped at `$400`, refreshed on `the 5th of each month`.

NOTE: You can choose to edit any of these 4 attributes of a budget: `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT`, `START_DATE`
and `PERIOD`, more than one at a time.

==== Delete a Budget (by Name) : `deletebudget`
Don't want it any more? Use `deletebudget` to say bye to your budget!

The concrete format is:
----
deletebudget d/<BUDGET_NAME>
----

For example, after typing:

----
deletebudget d/school
----

The budget with the name `school` will be deleted.

NOTE: The *Default Budget* cannot be deleted or modified. It archives all expenses without a proper budget defined by you. +
After a budget is deleted, its expenses will be transferred to the Default Budget.

==== Delete a Budget (by Index) : `deletebudget-id`
Budget names are too long? Don't worry, there's an easier way to delete them: `deletebudget-id`.

The concrete format is:
----
listbudget (first go to list of budgets)
deletebudget-id <INDEX>
----
You'll see the corresponding budget disappear from the list.

NOTE: Regretted? Type `undo` to get it back ;D

==== Delete all budgets: `clearbudget`
Don't feel like living on budgets any more? You can clear them all, just using this simple command:
`clearbudget`.

==== View Expenses in a Different Period: `switchperiod`
Wanna see your archived expenses in the past? The command `switchperiod` is the time machine you need.

The concrete format is:
----
switchperiod t/<DATE>
----

For example, suppose you have a monthly budget `school`, refreshed on `the 1st of each month`; and
suppose it is November now. After typing:
----
switchperiod t/01-05
----
You'll see all expenses tracked under `school` from `1 May to 31 May` this year.

NOTE: The time machine can only travel *back* in time! That is, you will only be able to switch to periods
*before or equal to* the current period. If the date you enter is in a future period, you'll need to input again. +
Only expenses tracked under *the current budget* are shown.

==== Edit Expenses Inside a Budget: `editexpense-primary`
When you are staring at the primary budget panel, and suddenly want to modify an expense...
Rather than switch back to the general expense list, there's a quicker way to do it: you can edit it *directly from
this budget panel*! The trick is: `editexpense-primary`.

The concrete format is:
----
editexpense-primary <INDEX> [d/<DESCRIPTION>] [p/<PRICE>] [c/<CATEGORY>] [t/<TIMESTAMP>]
----

The `INDEX` depends on the current budget's expenses, instead of the general expense list.

NOTE: Editing an expense from a budget has the same effect as editing it from the general expense list.
That is, this expense will also be updated in the general expense list.

==== Delete expense inside a budget: `deleteexpense-primary`
Similarly to editing expense inside a budget, you can delete an expense *directly from the
budget panel*: `deleteexpense-primary`.

The concrete format is:
----
deleteexpense-primary <INDEX>
----

The `INDEX` depends on the current budget's expenses, instead of the general expense list.

NOTE: Deleting an expense from a budget has the same effect as deleting it from the general expense list.
That is, this expense will also disappear from the general expense list.

//end::budget[]

// tag::brian[]

=== Making inputs quick and easy.

==== Creating a shortcut:  `alias`
You can save your favourite inputs by assigning them to an `alias`.

The format is:
------
addalias a/<ALIAS_NAME> i/<INPUT>
------
For example, you can type:
----
addalias a/chicken i/ addexpense d/ Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food
----
This creates an alias `chicken` for `addexpense d/ Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food` which when executed creates: +
an `Expense` with `price=2.50` and `description=“Chicken Rice”` in the `Food category`.

You may also create an alias with an incomplete input which you may add arguments to when using it:
----
addalias a/ addfood i/ addexpense c/Food
addfood d/ chickenrice p/3.50
----

****
*Note*

* Alias names cannot contain white spaces.
* Alias names cannot be the name of another alias.
* You may not create an alias that creates an alias.
* Using the same name for an alias will overwrite the existing alias if it exists.
****

****
*Warning*  +
Because MooLah prioritizes later instances of a prefix, including `a/` and `i/` in your input may cause your Alias to
not be parsed properly.
****
==== Listing the shortcuts you have saved: `listaliases`
To view the aliases you have defined, you may use the `listaliases`.

Alternatively, you may use the `view` command by typing `view Aliases`.

Either of these will bring you to the `User Defined Aliases` panel where
you can see the list of aliases you have created.

==== Deleting the shortcuts you no longer want to use: `deletealias`
To delete an `Alias` you no longer wish to use, you may use the `deletealias` command.

This is the format:
----
deletealias <ALIAS_NAME>
----
This will delete the `Alias` with the name you specified. For example:
----
addalias a/hello i/helloworld
deletealias hello
----
This will delete the `hello` from your saved shortcuts.

==== Autocomplete
When entering a command, MooLah will show you a list of valid command words which match the text you have entered.
****
image:autocommand0.png[width="350px"] +
You can press kbd:[TAB] to cycle through the available suggestions and press kbd:[ENTER] to autocomplete.
All other keys will hide the menu.
****

When you have entered a valid command, MooLah will show you a list of prefixes you have missed while typing your input.
Prefixes with the red `Missing` tag are required prefixes you have not entered. While orange `Optional`
prefixes are not necessary.

****
image:autoprefix0.png[width="350px"] +
You can press kbd:[TAB] to cycle through the available suggestions and press kbd:[ENTER] to autocomplete.
All other keys will hide the menu.
****

****
image:autoprefix1.png[width="350px"] +
After including the prefix, the prefix will not be included in the menu.
****

If you choose `ALL MISSING`, all your missing required prefixes will be inserted.


==== Syntax Highlighting
****
image:syntaxhighlighting0.png[width="350px"] +
argument and prefix highlighting
****
MooLah highlights valid prefixes, and indicates what arguments fall under them.

*note*: while an argument may be highlighted, it does mean the value is valid.

****
image:descriptionplaceholder.png[width="350px"] +
`<placeholder>` for description field
****
After typing in a prefix, MooLah will put a `<placeholder>` to remind you what the argument you should
enter is. +
Typing over this area will write write over the placeholder.

****
image:amountplaceholder.png[width="350px"] +
`<placeholder>` for amount field
****

*note* +
If you forget to type over the placeholders, do not worry. It will not affect your input as these placeholders are
ignored during execution of your input.

==== Input history
You may cycle through successfully entered commands during the current session with the kbd:[UP] and kbd:[DOWN] keys.

For example, if you entered these commands previously.
----
addexpense d/chickenrice p/12.3 c/food
addexpense d/chickenrice p/12.3 c/food
addexpense d/duck rice p/12.3111 c/food
----
You may cycle through these commands using the arrow keys.

=== Viewing Statistics
Like most of the expense commands, statistics of your expenses can be generated concerning
to the primary budget you're residing on. Read further for the rest of the commands covered
under the Statistics section.

==== Summary Statistics: `statsbasic`
This command allows you to have a basic summary of the money spent from their
categorical expenses in a given period of their current budget.

The visual output of the statistics shown is a pie chart, with each piece representing
the combined expenditure of all expenses under the category,
taken as a percentage of the total expenditure in the budget the command was called.


Format: `statsbasic [sd/<START_DATE>] [ed/<END_DATE>]`

****
*Note*

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- The success message for this command is "Pie Chart calculated!"

- Categories where no tracked expenses fall under will not be reflected in the Statistics Panel.

- Even though the `Default Budget` can contain expenses and has a valid budget period, it is not
recommended to type this command when in that budget. It is after all a placeholder budget that
is meant to hold expenses not associated to any budgets when starting out, which also implies it
doesn't support editing any of its attributes, especially period. Also, the budget period is set to
a large interval by design, so the output might not make sense.

- When there are no expenses in the current window of the current budget, a successful `statsbasic`
can stil be called. However, the same success message "Pie Chart calculated!" is still seen on the result display,
but now with a blank screen in the StatsPanel.


****

Tips:

- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time and statistics is calculated till one unit of time after `START_DATE`.

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, the period of the current budget will be considered as
the unit of time and statistics is calculated starting from one unit of time before `END_DATE`.

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics will be calculated using the start date and end date
of the current window of the budget, seen on the top right of the budget progress bar.

- As the 3 alternative configurations involve the knowledge of the budget's period, be familiar with the
procedure of editing a budget's period.

Example of configurations:
----
statsbasic
statsbasic sd/ytd
statsbasic sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018
----

Step-by-step guide:
For example, MooLah is currently at the "Outside School" budget, and shown below is the view of
the current window of the Budget from start of 18 Oct to the end of 24 Oct. There are exactly
4 expenses as shown in the example.

image::OutsideSchoolWindow.png[width="790"]

To generate the pie chart for the expenses for this window.


. Type `statsbasic` into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result display will display the message "Pie Chart calculated!".
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the Pie Chart will be generated
as shown below.

image::PieChart.png[width="790"]


+








==== Comparison Statistics: `statscompare`


This command allows you to have a side-to-side comparison
of the money spent from their categorical expenses in
2 periods of their current budget. In this comparison, we provide
you with data of both the similarities and differences in these 2
periods.

The visual output of the statistics shown is a table view,
with 5 columns, consisting of a category column, and 2 pairs of
frequency-total expenditure columns. The cells in the first pair
of columns, denoted as "similarity columns" represents the frequency and
total expenditure in any existing overlapping interval between the 2 periods,
while the cells in the second pair of columns, denoted as the "difference columns"
represents the difference in frequency and difference in total expenditure.

*Note*

- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- The end dates for both start dates specified by the user are constructed using the period
that the current budget is using. To switch the period of analysis, consider editing the duration of the budget.

- The cells in the "similarity columns" denote only non-negative values. This is because it
shows the frequency and total expenditure common to both periods.

- The cells in the "difference columns" may contain negative values. This is because
the values for differences in frequency and differences in total expenditure for each category
is calculated using the formula `second period – first period`.

- The success message for this command is "Statistics Comparison Calculated!"

- The default size of the application window accounts just sufficiently for a nicely fitted view of the
table columns. Adjustments to the program window should not be made, otherwise some columns may be covered
or excess space will be revealed. Currently the default startup dimension is Height = 800 and Width = 1254.

- Even though the `Default Budget` can contain expenses and has a valid budget period, it is not
recommended to type this command when in that budget. It is after all a placeholder budget that
is meant to hold expenses not associated to any budgets when starting out, which also implies it
doesn't support editing any of its attributes, especially period. Also, the budget period is set to
a large interval by design, so the output might not make sense.

Tips:

- If zeroes are observed in the similarity columns, it may be possible that there is no
overlap between the 2 periods or there are no expenses recorded in the common period.

- It is possible to reorder the columns generated after the Table is being generated for better
comparison.

- As the 2 intervals to be compared are constructed with the budget's period, be familiar with the
procedure of editing a budget's period.



Example of configurations:
----
statscompare sd1/12-12 sd2/ 1 month ago
stats sd2/ today sd1/ytd
stats sd2/ 23-09-2019 sd1/1 year ago
----

Step-by-step guide:

To generate the table view:

. Type `statscompare sd1/27-10 sd2/ 28-10' into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result display will display the message "Statistics Comparison Calculated!".
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the Table View will be generated.

==== Growth Statistics : `statstrend`

This command allows you to see the growth
of the money spent from their categorical expenses in specified
units of time between the period specified in the current budget.

The visual output of the statistics shown is in the form of plotted
trend lines.

Currently 2 modes of usage can be selected.

The first one is a `category`
mode where each individual trend lines represents one categories and
every plotted point on a line represents the total expenditure starting from its stated date,
till before the stated date of the next point.

The second mode is a `budget` mode where only 2 trend lines can be observed.
The first trend line represents the budget limit where every plotted point represents
the budget limit set starting from its stated date,
till before the stated date of the next point.

The second trend line represents the total expenditure for all expenses regardless of category,
where every plotted point represents the total expenditure starting from its stated date,
till before the stated date of the next point.

Format: `statstrend [sd/<START_DATE>] [ed/<END_DATE>] mode/MODE`

*Note*

- Date formats accepted are handled by our Natural Language Parser library which supports human jargons.
Please refer to the above documentation for more information.

- For any input that consists of date and time, only, only the date information will be considered.

- Expenses to be included in the statistics generated include those on the start dates and end dates itself.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- We only allow a maximum of 33 plotted points to be displayed, which means that in any specified
time interval bounded by the start date and end date, we will produce at most 33 time intervals of
the specified unit of time starting from the start date. This is also a design consideration to coordinate
with the size of the application window.

- The first plotted point that would be observed should be the start date of the window of the current budget
closest to the start date of analysis. If the two happen to be the same, the start date of the window of the budget
should be included as a point in the trend line

- Even though the current application doesn't allow for expenses to be added into dates ahead of the current date,
the budget windows after the most recent possible window, relative to the current date, will still be shown for ths command.
This also applies to budget windows which have intervals that are future to the current time. For example, a window spanning
from 18 Oct to 24 Oct for a weekly budget is a legal point even when it is currently 19 Oct.

- The success message for this command is "Statistics Trend Calculated!"

- The categories that do not have any expenses in any of the time intervals will not be reflected
as trend lines in the Statistics Panel.

- Even though the `Default Budget` can contain expenses and has a valid budget period, it is not
recommended to type this command when in that budget. It is after all a placeholder budget that
is meant to hold expenses not associated to any budgets when starting out, which also implies it
doesn't support editing any of its attributes, especially period. Also, the budget period is set to
a large interval by design, so the output might not make sense.

Tips:

- There is no need to specify all the parameters if the outcomes of the example usage scenarios
below fit your needs

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, the end date of analysis is constructed till 34 unit of time after `START_DATE`,
before the consideration of the earliest available window of the current budget.

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, the start date of analysis is constructed from 34 unit of time before `END_DATE`,
before the consideration of the earliest available window of the current budget.

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, the start date of analys is constructed from 17 units of time before the start date
of the current window of the current budget and the end date of analysis is constructed from 17 units after the
start date of the current window of the current budget.

- The unit interval of time is set to always be the period of the current budget,
hence to access other time modes of this command, please edit the budget's period.

- As the 3 alternative configurations involve the knowledge of the budget's period, be familiar with the
procedure of editing a budget's period.

Example of configurations:
----
statstrend mode/category
statstrend sd/ytd mode/category
statstrend sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018 mode/category

Step-by-step guide:

To generate the trend lines:

. Type `statstrend mode/category` into the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
. The result box will display the message "Statistics Trend Calculated!".
. The screen will be switched into the Statistics Panel where the trend lines will be generated.
