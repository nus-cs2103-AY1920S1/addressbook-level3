    "description": "This module will examine the environments in which clastic, carbonate and (bio)chemical sediments are deposited at the present day, both terrestrial and marine. Following this, the structural and stratigraphic architecture of ancient and modern sedimentary basins will be studied through the theory of stratigraphy. Relationships between climate change, sea level change and changing sedimentation patterns in the geological past, present and future will be examined. Students will see of the relevance of these topics to the understanding of the evolving present day sedimentary environments and their application to the exploration for petroleum.",
