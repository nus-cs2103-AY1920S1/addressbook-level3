    "description": "The module is designed as an introduction to Southeast Asian cosmopolitan urbanism, and is targeted at students with an interest in the region and who wish to get hands-on, in-depth and on-site direct learning experience, especially in cultural heritage conservation and management. The course will challenge students to investigate the complexity, nuances and contradictions of cosmopolitan urban heritage, both in its tangible and intangible dimensions, through lectures, field work, synchronic/diachronic mapping, critical analysis, interactive presentation, and collection of found objects. An intensive 9-day lecture/workshop and fieldwork program is followed by a week of presentation and discussions of findings, as preparations for a public exhibition.",
