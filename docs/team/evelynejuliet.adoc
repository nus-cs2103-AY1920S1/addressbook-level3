---

iFridge is a desktop grocery management application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands* for grocery list, shopping list, and template list command.
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands
and undo/redo implementation needs to be adjusted to the different types of list and its properties.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a *reminder command* to conveniently check for grocery item(s) expiring soon.
** What it does: Display all grocery items expiring within specified number of days.
** Justification: This feature increase helps users to better able keep track of their grocery items
based on their expiry dates when there are a lot of grocery items in the grocery list.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds more convenience and usability to users as they can easily check for only grocery items
which they are interested in with respect to their expiry dates and remind them on grocery items that are expiring soon.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a *reminder default command* which serves as an iFridge settings.
** What it does: Saves the user preference on the default number of days used to determine whether a grocery item is expiring soon or not.
** Justification: This is used in color coding grocery list and waste list based on expiry dates,
as well as for reminder command to check reminders for expiring food when no specific number of days is specified.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds more convenience to users as they can set their preference on color coding conditions
for grocery list and waste list which will be saved even when the app is closed and reused when the app is reopened.
It also gives the impression that the app can be personalized based on their preference as changes can be seen directly in the
user interface.

* *Minor enhancement*: designed and implemented the overall user interface of the application.
** What it does: It provides the ability to switch between the different types of list and color code the
food items based on their expiry dates (mentioned earlier).
** Justification: Linked the logic of different commands to the user interface so any changes to the model will
be visible and easily understandable by the users.
** Highlights: This enhancement improves the overall usability of the app.
