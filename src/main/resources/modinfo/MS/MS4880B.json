    "description": "This module examines the encounters between Malay culture and globalization. Dimensions of these encounters include the dissolving of frontiers and divisions of Malay culture associated with global consumer citizenship, the active interpenetration and combination of cultural elements as a consequence of human flows and availability of information and, developments revolving around rejection or turning away from changes that have come out of global integration. Empirical cases drawn from the Malay world in the areas of media, internet, tourism, popular culture and music etc will be discussed towards understanding the factor of diversity and difference in the Malay cultural experience of global modernity. Particular emphasis is given to the economic and cultural dimensions of globalization.",
