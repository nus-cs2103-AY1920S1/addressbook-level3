    "description": "This module maps out the main currents of contemporary social theories ranging from the legacy of the classical tradition, comparative-historical sociology, interpretative sociology, functionalism and neo-functionalism, rational choice, globalization theories and the macro-micro debates. In exploring the nature and status of social scientific theories we deal with the universalism/relativism debate and link it to the problems of globalized vs. indigenized social theories. This module is mounted for students with a keen interest in social theories.",
