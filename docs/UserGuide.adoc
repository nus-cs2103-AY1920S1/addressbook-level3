[[intro]]
== Introduction
// tag::intro[]

The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS) is a desktop app that aims
to combine Command Line Interface (CLI) style commands with a triple-pane
GUI for easy navigation of module appeals, module information, and student
particulars. This app is particularly aimed towards *module appeal
administrators who prefer to work through their heavy backload of module appeals
without ever having to leave the comfort of the keyboard for their mouse*.
The MAMS system can quickly bring up entire lists of students, appeals,
and modules for side-by-side comparison, with specific display commands
to view the expanded details of any particular object in question.
Once reviewing of the information is complete, the MAMS system also
provides a suite of commands for resolving appeals,
overriding MC limits, and allocation of modules to students.

[[quickStart]]
== Quick Start
// tag::quickStart[]
.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mams.jar`
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T11-2/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder
for The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS).
. **Important**: Unzip `data.zip`. Inside, there should be a folder
containing `mams.json`, ie. `data/mams.json`.
Copy the `data` folder containing `mams.json` to the same directory as `mams.jar`.

  - This is required due to the special nature of the application,
where target users are specifically restricted from
deleting/adding data entries since it does not fall under their job scope.
We hence provide a sample data-set for testing purposes.
This may be replaced with actual data differing on a semester-by-semester basis.
 - Note that certain un-archiver tools may automatically create a
new parent `data/` folder around the zipped `data/` folder.
Should that happen, please only move the inner `data/` folder
containing `mams.json` to the target directory.
 - **Important** : Before proceeding to the next step, check that the resulting
folder structure/names look a little like the below:

  .
  ├── mams.jar
  └── data/
      └── mams.json

.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790", align="center"]
+
.  NOTE: If the GUI does not display any items on startup,
the previous step was performed incorrectly.
Please close the application and review the folder structure.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
. Note that the application is developed primarily for Windows
or MacOS usage. If you use a different OS,
you may face unexpected issues.

//end::quickStart[]

[[Features]]
== Features

// tag::featuresPreamble[]

Broadly speaking, MAMS handles three main types of items: *Appeals, Modules, and Students*.

An appeal request is uniquely identified by a prefix `C`, followed by a 6-digit Case ID, eg. `C123456`

A module is uniquely identified by a COURSE_PREFIX (eg. `CS` for Computer Science) and a 4 character sequence. eg. `CS2103`.

A student is uniquely identified by his/her 8-character Matriculation Number starting with a letter, eg. `A0132243`

====
*Command Format*

* Each command must begin with a command word. See each command
below for the list of associated command words.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the arguments to be supplied by the user eg. `INDEX` denotes
that you should provide a numeric index in the command-specified format.
* Items enclosed by square brackets are optional, eg. `list [-a] [-m] [-s]`
can be used as `list` or `list -s`.
However, some commands may require that at
least one of the optional parameters be present. These will be specified
in the command itself.
* Any item that is followed by an ellipsis (`...`) can be used multiple times including zero
eg. `[m/PARAMETER]...` can be supplied as `m/PARAMETER` or `m/PARAMETER1 m/PARAMETER2`
* Arguments within square brackets can be supplied in any order.
* As a general rule, invalid or unnecessary parameters will cause
the command to be treated as invalid. This is not
definitive, however, and exceptions to this rule may be specified
for specific commands, either now or in the future.
* Tags will often be used in the command to specify the targeted list for the command.
Certain commands allow operations on multiple lists, eg.
** `a/` : prefix for supplying values specific to the
`Appeal List` (`a/VALUE_TO_BE_SUPPLIED`)
** `m/` : prefix for supplying values specific to the
`Module List` (`m/VALUE_TO_BE_SUPPLIED`)
** `s/` : prefix for supplying values specific to the
`Student List` (`m/VALUE_TO_BE_SUPPLIED`)
** This list is not exhaustive, and is for illustrative purposes only.
Precise formats will be given in each command.
====

// end::featuresPreamble[]

// tag::view[]
=== Viewing single objects: `view`

This command brings up an item with fully expanded details on a single pane.
Multiple MAMS items can be displayed
in one single command, as long as they are from different types.

Format: `view [a/INDEX] [m/INDEX] [s/INDEX]`

Note: Even though all the parameter tags are marked as optional,
at least one must be present for the command to
execute. In the case where a parameter tag is used more than once,
the last tag of that type will be accepted.

Tags:

* `a/INDEX`: displays the expanded details of the appeal at `INDEX` on the displayed appeal list
* `m/INDEX`: displays the expanded details of the module at `INDEX` on the displayed module list
* `s/INDEX`: displays the expanded details of the student at `INDEX` on the displayed student list
*  All supplied `INDEX` values must be non-zero positive integers.
*  When multiple tags of the same type are specified, only the last supplied tag of each type will be checked.
*  Invalid parameters will cause the command to fail
*  At least one prefix must be present for the command to execute successfully.

*Examples:*

Sample Input:

* `view m/7`

image::ViewCommandDemoBefore.png[width="790", align="center"]

Sample Output: Fully expanded administrative details of the module at index 7.

image::ViewCommandDemoAfter.png[width="790", align="center"]

// end::view[]

// tag::list[]

=== Listing objects by specified lists: `list`

Format: `list [-a] [-m] [-s]`

Options:

* `-a`: lists out all appeals in MAMS
* `-m`: lists out all modules in MAMS
* `-s`: lists out all students in MAMS
* if no options are specified, `list` command will behave as
though all three tags have be applied. ie. it will
list out all appeals, modules, and students. This is for the convenience of the user.
* if an invalid parameter has been supplied, eg. `hello`, `-hs` or `-invalid`, an error/usage message will be shown,
and the command will be aborted.
** eg. for `list -a hello -invalid`, `hello` and `-invalid` will cause the command to fail.

*Examples:*

Sample Input:

* `list -a -s`

image::ListCommandDemoBefore.png[width="790", align="center"]

Sample Output: Lists all appeals and students in MAMS

image::ListCommandDemoAfter.png[width="790", align="center"]

//end::list[]

// tag::history[]

=== Command History

==== Cycle through command history

In the command box (the area where you type in commands), you can cycle through your previous inputs by using the
kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys. They will autofill the command box with the previous and next input stored
in the command history respectively, in a style similar to most CLI terminals.

Example:

image::HistoryCommandArrowDemoBefore.png[width="790", align="center"]

After pressing kbd:[&uarr;]

image::HistoryCommandArrowDemoAfter.png[width="790", align="center"]

==== Show command history: `history`

Opens a separate window displaying the command history in MAMS. The display of the command feedback can be turned
off.

Format: `history [-o] [-s]`

Options:

* `-o`: hide the command feedback in the history window
* `-s`: show only successful commands in the history window
* all options for this command must be space-delimited, as shown in the format above
* if no options are supplied, the `history` command will default to show
both command input and command feedback history in the
history window, as well as all executed commands (regardless of success status).
* if an invalid parameter has been supplied, eg. `hello`, `-hs` or `-invalid`, an error/usage message will be shown,
and the command will be aborted.
** eg. for `history -o hello -invalid`, `hello` and `-invalid` will cause the command to fail.

Hot-key Usage:

When the history display on the history window is focused, you may use several hot-keys to navigate around the window.
They are as follows:

* kbd:[&uarr;] kbd:[&darr;] Navigate up and down the history entries.
* kbd:[q] Copy the command of the currently selected history entry to the system clipboard.
* kbd:[esc] Close the history window.

*Examples:*

Sample Input:

* `history`

image::HistoryCommandDemo.png[width="790", align="center"]

Sample Output: Opens a window displaying command history

image::HistoryWindowDemo.png[width="790", align="center"]

After pressing kbd:[&uarr;] two times,

image::HistoryWindowUpArrowDemo.png[width="790", align="center"]

Now, after pressing kbd:[q], the command text of the selected cell will be copied,


image::HistoryWindowCopyDemo.png[width="789", align="center"]

==== Sync Command History to disk

Command history is automatically saved to disk whenever it is updated with new inputs.
Upon the next MAMS startup, previous command history will be loaded from disk as well.
In other words, command history is persistent across usage sessions of MAMS.

//end::history[]

//tag::find[]
=== Find keywords: `find`

Displays item(s) that contain(s) any of the keyword(s) in the specified list(s).

Format: `find [a/KEYWORD...] [m/KEYWORD...] [s/KEYWORD...]`

_Tags can be in any order. User may enter multiple keywords after a tag._

====
*Searching Criteria*

* `find` supports searching in the specified lists for all items containing the keyword as a word or a part of word (See examples for more details).
* Searching is case-insensitive.
* In Appeal list, items that contains any of the keywords in Appeal Type, Appeal ID, Status(resolved/unresolved),
 Requested Module or Module to Drop will be displayed.
* In Module list, items that contains any of the keywords in Module Code, Module Name, or Module Description (is be shown in expanded view) wil be displayed.
* In Student list, items that contains any of the keywords in Student Name or Matric ID will be displayed.
* Searching criteria listed above are evaluated to be the most useful ones in order to filter the lists quickly and obtain
necessary information. Wider range of searching will be implemented in v2.0.
====

Examples:

* `find s/larry m/programming`

Sample Output:

All items containing "larry" in Student list and all items containing "programming" are displayed.
Student list defaults to expanded view since there is only 1 search result.

_CS1020 and CS2105 are displayed since they contain "programming" in their Module Description. You may use `view` command to see._

image::FindDemoSingleKeyword.png[width="790", align="center"]

// end::find[]

* `find a/add drop`

Sample Output:

All items containing "add" or "drop" in Appeal list are displayed.

image::FindDemoMultipleKeywords.png[width="790", align="center"]

* `find m/cs10`

Sample Output:

All items containing "cs10" in Module list are displayed. (i.e. CS1010, CS1020, CS2030)

_CS2030 is also displayed since it contains "cs10" in its module description._

image::FindDemoModuleSearch.png[width="790", align="center"]

//tag::clash[]

=== Check clashes: `clash`

[NOTE]
If you execute `clash` command by index, the index will refer for the current index in the list showing currently. Please
use `list` command to go back to the full list if your target appeal/module/student is not shown in the current list.

==== Check clashes in an appeal

This command checks if there is clash between the module which a student is requesting to add or drop and his/her current modules.
Only appeals requesting to add or drop module will need for clash checks. If the target appeal is not of any of the two
types, a reminder message will be shown.

Format: `clash a/INDEX`

Examples:

* `clash a/1`

Sample output:

image::ClashCommandInvalidAppealType.png[width="790", align="center"]

* `clash a/6`

Sample output:

image::AppealClashDetected.png[width="790", align="center"]

==== Check clashes in a student's timetable

This command checks if there are clashes in a student’s current timetable. This command is typically used to verify whether
there is really a timetable clash in the student's timetable if the student submits an appeal to drop a
pre-allocated module due to timetable clash.

Format: `clash s/INDEX`

Examples:

* `clash s/2`

Sample output:

image::StudentClashDetected.png[width="790", align="center"]

==== Check clashes between 2 modules
This command checks if the lecture slots of 2 modules have clashes, and displays the result to the user.

Format: `clash m/MODULE_CODE m/MODULE_CODE` or `clash m/INDEX m/INDEX`

Examples:

* `clash m/cs1010 m/cs1020`

Sample output:

image::NoClashDetectedResponse.png[width="790", align="center"]

* `clash m/1 m/3`

Sample output:

image::ModuleClashDetected.png[width="790", align="center"]

// end::clash[]
