== PROJECT: DeliveryMANS

---

== Overview
*DeliveryMANS*, which stands for Delivery MANagement System, is a system for administrators of food delivery applications
to efficiently manage the restaurants, customers and deliverymen using the application.

== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Restaurant Manager
** *What it does*: Manages all the restaurants in the application database as well as their operations,
such as changing of the restaurant's details, menu and orders.
** *Justification*: Restaurants are one of the 3 main stakeholders of a food delivery application,
together with customers and deliverymen. A good food delivery application has a large number of restaurants in its
database to offer more choices to the users / customers.
Changes and updates to these restaurants are frequent: restaurants are often
changing their menu; relocation and renaming of restaurants can happen too. Together with the large amount of orders
a restaurant receives every day (with the increase in popularity of food delivery services), managing the huge
restaurant database can be a hassle for administrators. This Restaurant Manager allows for efficient managing of
the large restaurant database through the following highlights that would save administrators much workload and time.
** *Highlights*:
*** Restaurant Manager supports EditMode for restaurants: the one interface to view and edit a restaurant's
many attributes, i.e. details, menu and orders. Under EditMode, each attribute of the restaurant will be
displayed in its own separate panel so administrators can have a clear view of all the attributes at one glance.
Commands that edit the restaurant's attributes individually, such as `AddFoodCommand`, `EditDetailsCommand`
and `AddRatingCommand`, are also unlocked.
This is a feature that involves multiple components of the application (UI, Storage, Order Manager, Logic):
**** UI is changed upon entering / exiting EditMode to display / hide the new interface.
**** Every change made to the restaurant in EditMode would have to update that restaurant stored in the database.
**** Certain changes made to the restaurant in EditMode (e.g. changing of name, changing of menu) would have to update the
relevant information in each of the restaurant's orders.
**** Commands unlocked by EditMode should only be accessible in EditMode.

*** Restaurant Manager supports auto-tagging of food items as "Popular".
An important information that customers wish to be displayed in the application
is which food items in a restaurant's menu are "Popular", i.e. frequently ordered, which would aid them in their choice
of food items to order. To determine which food items in a particular restaurant are popular,
statistics from previous completed orders, such as number of orders of each food item, would have to be stored.
Upon completion of every new order, statistics are updated, the percentage of orders of each food item in the menu
is calculated and analysed, and auto-tagged as "popular" if a certain threshold is passed.
Auto-tagging saves administrators the workload of manually calculating the statistics and manually
tagging each popular food in the huge food database.

=== Restaurant commands

Commands in the restaurant context

==== Adding a restaurant: `add`
This command adds a restaurant to the restaurant database.

Format: `add n/NAME l/LOCATION [t/TAG]...`

* `LOCATION` can only be one of the following locations: Jurong, Tuas, Woodlands, Bishan, City,
Marina, Changi, Punggol.

Example: `add n/KFC l/Jurong t/FastFood`


==== Deleting a restaurant: `delete`
This command deletes the restaurant at the specified index in the restaurant list from the restaurant database.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer from 1 to n, the number of restaurants in the restaurant list.

Example: `delete 1`

[NOTE]
====
.Note:

* Deleting a restaurant will delete all its existing orders from the order database as well.
====


==== Entering EditMode: `editmode`
This command enters EditMode for the restaurant identified by the specified index in the restaurant list.
Displays the restaurant's details, menu and current orders.
Unlocks commands for editing details, adding and removing of food items
in the menu, and adding of rating.

Format: `editmode INDEX`

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer from 1 to n, the number of restaurants in the restaurant list.

Example: `editmode 3`

==== Editing restaurant's details (under EditMode): `editdetails`
This command edits the details of the restaurant under EditMode.

Format: `editdetails [n/NAME] [l/LOCATION] [t/TAG]…​`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the restaurant will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the restaurant’s tags by typing t/ without specifying any tags after it.

Example: `editdetails n/Dr Hogs Barbeque l/Punggol t/Barbeque t/Western`

image::userguide\EditDetails.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
====
.Note:

* Editing a restaurant's name will edit the restaurant name in all its existing orders as well.

====


==== Adding food item (under EditMode): `add`
This command adds a food item to the menu of the restaurant under EditMode.

Format: `add n/NAME a/PRICE [t/TAG]...`

* You can only tag a food item as "Recommended".

Example: `add n/Chicken a/7.90 t/Recommended`

==== Deleting food item (under EditMode): `delete`
This command deletes the food item at the specified index in the menu of the restaurant under EditMode.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer from 1 to n, the number of food items in the restaurant's menu.

Example: `delete 1`

[NOTE]
====
.Note:
* Deleting a food item from a restaurant will NOT delete the food item in the restaurant's orders as
the order was made when the food item was still available.
====


==== Adding a rating (under EditMode): `rate`
This command adds a rating to the restaurant under EditMode and updates the new average rating of all the ratings
added to date.

Format: `rate RATING`

* `RATING` must be a non-negative integer from 0 to 5.

Example: `rate 4`


==== Exiting EditMode: `exitedit`
This command exits EditMode for the specific restaurant and returns to the list of restaurants

Format: `exitedit`


==== Auto-tagging of food item as "Popular"
Food items with quantity ordered more than 1.5 times the average quantity ordered of food items in the restaurant
will be automatically tagged as "Popular".

Example (refer to image below):

* 16 food items are ordered in Order 2 (1 + 2 + 6 + 7), an average quantity ordered of 4 per food item.
* Quantity ordered of food items Cheese Prata and Prata Bomb (6 and 7 respectively) is more than 1.5 times
the average quantity ordered. Automatically tagged as "Popular" upon completion of Order 2.

[NOTE]
====
.Note:
* Food items' quantity ordered will only be updated upon completion of an order.

=== EditMode for restaurants
A `Restaurant` object contains many attributes. On top of a `Name`, `Location`, `Rating` and a list of `Tag`,
it also includes a list of `Food` as its menu, as well as a list of `Order`. This makes it difficult to edit
an entire `Restaurant` object using just one `Command`.

The EditMode feature allows editing of a specific `Restaurant` object's details (name, location, rating, tags),
menu and orders individually under 1 interface, using different commands.

==== Implementation
**Model**:

In addition to the `filteredRestaurantList` that contains all the restaurants in the restaurant database,
`ModelManager` now contains a `editingRestaurantList`, which holds and allows access to the single restaurant
currently under EditMode.

When user inputs the `editmode INDEX` command:

* The restaurant referenced by the `INDEX` in the list of restaurants will be placed
in the `editingRestaurantList` via the function call `Model#setEditingRestaurant(Restaurant editingRestaurant`.
* Subsequent commands that edit the restaurant, such as `AddFoodCommand`, `DeleteFoodCommand`, `AddRatingCommand`
and `EditDetailsCommand` will create a new restaurant with the edited attributes.
* The outdated restaurant will be replaced with the new edited restaurant
in both the `filteredRestaurantList` and `editingRestaurantList` via the function call
`Model#setRestaurant(Restaurant oldRestaurant, Restaurant newRestaurant)`.

**Logic**:

The `Logic` for EditMode is facilitated by `Context` enum type, which contains the following constants:
`GLOBAL`, `CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `DELIVERYMEN` and `EDITING`. It determines the `Context` the application is in,
as well as the commands the user can access. It is contained inside `LogicManager` as an attribute. `EditModeCommand` is only
accessible in `Context.RESTAURANT`, and entering a valid `EditModeCommand` will change the `Context` to `Context.EDITING`.

The following class diagram shows the relevant structure of `Logic` and `Parser`:

image::developerguide\ParserClassDiagram.png[]

When the user inputs a command:

* `userInput` will always be parsed by `UniversalParser` first, regardless of the current `Context`.
The reason for this is to check for universal commands, which are accessible in all `Context`.
* Subsequently, if the command word in `userInput` matches none of the universal commands, then `UniversalParser`
will create a context specific `Parser` based on the current `Context`, i.e. `CustomerParser`, `RestaurantParser`,
`DeliverymenParser`, `EditingParser`, which takes over and parses the `userInput`.
Any context switching command will then change the `Context` in `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when the user enters a command:

image::developerguide\ParserActivityDiagram.png[]

When user inputs the `editmode INDEX` command:

* `UniversalParser` will parse it first.
* Since `editmode` matches none of the universal commands, `UniversalParser` will create a new `RestaurantParser`
(since current `Context` is `Context.RESTAURANT` as `EditModeCommand` is only accessible in said `Context`).
* The new `RestaurantParser` will then parse the `userInput` and subsequently change the `Context` in `LogicManager` to `Context.EDITING`,
unlocking commands to edit the restaurant, such as `AddFoodCommand`, `DeleteFoodCommand`, `AddRatingCommand`
and `EditDetailsCommand`.

**UI**:

Commands that change the UI will either:

* Pass its command class to `MainWindow` in the UI package if the command doesn't change the `Context`
* Pass the new `Context` to `MainWindow` in the UI package if the command changes the `Context`.

as the second parameter of the `CommandResult` returned by the command.

When `MainWindow` receives the `CommandResult`, it will extract out either the command class or `Context` from
`CommandResult` and make changes to the UI accordingly via the function call
`MainWindow#changeDisplay(Context context)` or `MainWindow#changeDisplay(Class commandClassName)`.

When user inputs the `EditModeCommand`:

* Since `Context` is changed to `Context.EDITING`, it will be passed as the second parameter of the `CommandResult`
returned by the `EditModeCommand`.
* Upon receiving this new `Context`, `MainWindow` will call the function `changeDisplay(Context.EDITING)` to change
the UI. An extra `StackPane` showing the restaurant under EditMode will be displayed,
while the `SplitPane` displaying the list of restaurants originally will now be filled with the restaurant's `Food` menu
and `Order` list.

The following sequence diagram summarises how the `EditModeCommand` changes the UI:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Structure of `Logic` and `Parser`
* **Current:** `LogicManager` contains only the `UniversalParser`, which then creates a context-specific parser
depending on the current `Context` in `LogicManager`.
** Pros: Checking whether `userInput` is a universal command only needs to be done once in `UniversalParser`
** Cons: Doesn't make as much sense for `UniversalParser` to be able to create other context-specific parsers.
* **Alternative:** Instead of containing only the `UniversalParser`, which then creates the other 4 context-specific
parsers, `LogicManager` contains all 5 parsers.
** Pros: Makes more sense to have `LogicManager` containing all 5 parsers which parses `userInput` individually based
on the current context.
** Cons: Checking whether `userInput` is a universal command needs to be repeated in each parser.

===== Aspect: Changing of UI
* **Current:** If the `Command` that changes the UI does not change the `Context`, pass its command name
to `MainWindow` instead of creating a new `Context` to signal a change in UI.
** Pros: Does not create unnecessary `Context`.
** Cons: 2 method signatures are needed for `MainWindow#changeDisplay` to change the UI.
* **Alternative:** A new `Context` is created for every `Command` that changes the UI.
** Pros: Only 1 method signature is needed for `MainWindow#changeDisplay` to change the UI.
** Cons: Creates many unnecessary `Context` that `LogicManager` will never be in.
