    "description": "The formation, distribution and preservation or destruction\nof oil and natural gas resources are governed by geologic\nhistories of basins. Good understanding of geological\nprinciples and aspects of petroleum geoscience, therefore\nfounds the basis for successful exploration, development\nand production in the petroleum industry.\nThis course aims to provide students with a knowledgebase\nto understand the\n(1) fundamental principles of geology and its use for\nsedimentary basins studies.\n(2) nature and origin of petroleum and the methods for\ncharacterizing and evaluating hydrocarbon basins and\nprospects\n(3) direct experience of studying sedimentary rocks in an\noilfield.\nThis module also serves as an introduction to oil & gas\ndrilling and completion process. Starting from a typical Drill\nRig and its major systems, to the process of drilling\nonshore and offshore, to casing & cementing, through to\nwell completion.",
