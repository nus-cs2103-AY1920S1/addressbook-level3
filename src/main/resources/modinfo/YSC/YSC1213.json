    "description": "This introductory physics course uses the platform of hands-on electronics to introduce students to concepts in electro-magnetism including electrostatics and electrodynamics. Using electronic components to build linear and non-linear oscillators, students will be introduced to concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The course is intended for both science majors and also non-majors.",
