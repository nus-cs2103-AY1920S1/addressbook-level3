== PROJECT: Xpire

== Overview

Xpire is a desktop application used for tracking expiry dates of items.  The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

//** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view different lists and execute only commands permissible for the list specified*
** What it does: allows the user to view the list of items to be replenished from the main tracking list of items and vice versa. In the replenish list, certain commands are intentionally prohibited.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view and search for his or her items that have run out and replenish them as soon as possible. Items in the replenish list
are also differentiated from the items in the main tracking list, by limiting the commands available. This is founded on the basis that certain commands such as sorting by date would be rendered irrelevant as
items to be replenished do not have an expiry date or quantity unlike those in the main list.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to avoid making major changes to existing commands and littering of duplicate code
chunks. The implementation was also challenging because it requires a good command of generics to ensure that existing commands would work well with both items in the main tracking list and items to be
replenished, without making drastic changes to the code base.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to store both the main list and replenish list in one single json object*
** What it does: allows the user to retrieve previous entries created and edit them.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now read and write to the json file from the command-line interface for both lists.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to avoid extensive code duplication and major lags to the initialisation of the app.
The implementation was also challenging because of

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to recommend similar words for correction if any when a user makes mistakes in his or her input*
** What it does: recommends closely-related words detected in comparison to the user input
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them. With spelling corrections, they can now easily identify
their input mistakes and correct them with ease.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to avoid major lags in the performance
of existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: made certain commands such as sort and search stackable. This would have greater utility in cases where there are hundreds of items, and 1 search is deemed insufficient to sieve out an item.
This allows users to narrow down to items with greater ease, by sorting or searching the results of previous searches.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to auto-sort items in both lists by their name (lexicographical order) and date (chronological order),
allowing the user to add items and have them arranged in an organised fashion.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a sort command that allows the user to sort items by their name or date.

* *Minor enhancement*: added expiry date and quantity fields to item, and disallowed expiry dates before today.
