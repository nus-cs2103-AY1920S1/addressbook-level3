== Introduction
THRIFT is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. Maintain records of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions and constantly keep track of your spending and income! THRIFT is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills finance tracker, look no further than THRIFT!

This is how THRIFT looks like:

2. Download the latest THRIFT.jar https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-2/main/releases[here].
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your THRIFT application.
4. Double-click the file to start the app, the GUI should appear in a few seconds.
5. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.
6. Some example commands you can try:
*   `add_expense n/Apple Airpods v/200`: adds an expense called `Apple Airpods` which cost $`200`.
*   `add_income n/Bursary Award v/350`: adds an income called `Bursary Award` which incremented your budget by $`350`.
*   `delete i/1`: deletes the 1st transaction in the current list shown in the UI.

== Features:

Understanding this document:
[horizontal]
`add_expense`:: Words with a grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that it is a command, or a part of it.
kbd:[Enter]:: Words styled like this indicates a keyboard button.
UPPER_CASE:: Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters to be supplied by you. e.g. `add_expense n/EXPENSE_NAME v/VALUE`.
NOTE: Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/EXPENSE_NAME v/VALUE`, `v/VALUE n/EXPENSE_NAME` will achieve the same outcome.
**add_expense n/Lunch v/5**:: Words in bold indicates the input that would be entered by you.
_Debt_:: Words in italics indicate the literals used in the example commands.
[ ] :: Words in square brackets `[ ]` are optional e.g. `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Laksa`.
( | ) :: Words in round brackets `( )` with `|` are mandatory parameters where a selection is required e.g. `tag (add | delete)` means you need to input either `tag add` or `tag delete`.
... ::   Parameters with `...` after them can be used as often as zero to multiple times. e.g. `[t/TAG] …` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Food t/Dinner` etc.

[[BudgetTag]]
=== Setting monthly budget: `budget`

You are able to set a budget for each month in THRIFT. This allows THRIFT to display your remaining balance for the month and lets you keep your spending in check.

NOTE: It is not compulsory to set a budget for each month and you can use THRIFT normally without setting budgets.

==== Command syntax:
`budget v/VALUE d/MONTH`

****
* Sets your budget for the month specified in `MONTH` as `VALUE`.
* `VALUE` is any positive integer below one billion.
* `MONTH` is in `MM/YYYY` and `MM` is between `01-12`.
****

==== Example usage:

You wish to set your budget for the month _October 2019_ as $_2000_:

. Your current budget for the month _October 2019_ is $_0_.
+
image::/images/add-budget/Step1.png[,550]

. You type: **budget v/2000 d/10/2019** in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::/images/add-budget/Step2.png[,550]

. You should see in the result box that your budget for _October 2019_ has been set to $_2000_.

.List of undoable commands[[Undoable]]:
* `<<ExpenseTag, add_expense>>`
* `<<IncomeTag, add_income>>`
* `<<DeleteTag, delete>>`
* `<<UpdateTag, update>>`
* `<<CloneTag, clone>>`
* `<<TagTag, tag>>`
* `<<UntagTag, untag>>`
* `<<BudgetTag, budget>>`

Examples: +
Suppose you want to delete the second transaction (Bursary) in THRIFT, but you remove the third transaction instead!
One possible solution is that you add the transaction manually back into THRIFT, but this is too troublesome! You can
retrieve the deleted transaction by performing `undo`.

To `undo` the `delete` command:

. Type *undo* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter]:
+

WARNING: You cannot redo undone commands once the application exits or new undoable command is executed after `undo`.

Examples: +

but you decide to track the transaction using THRIFT. Instead of adding the transaction manually, you can add back
the transaction by executing `redo`.

+
