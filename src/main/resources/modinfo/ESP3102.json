    "description": "The aims of this module are to provide a comprehensive coverage of a range of nanofabrication and characterization techniques. The fabrication part will facus on top-down techniques which will complement the bottom-up techniques covered by CM3251 Nanochemistry. \n\n\n\nTopics to be covered include:\n\nNanofabrication: thin flim deposition, etching, photolithography, EUV, electron beam, x-ray and ion beam lithography, focused ion beam and direct laser writing, scanning probe based techniques, fabrication and alignment of nanostructures, manufacturing of nanodevices and nanosystems. \n\nNanocharacterization: basic principle of imaging, wave diffraction, interaction of energy beams with materials, optical and electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, electron transport measurement, magnetic measurement and optical spectroscopy.",
