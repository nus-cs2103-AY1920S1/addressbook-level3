== PROJECT: Typee


== Overview

We are a group of 5 NUS Computer Science students involved in enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop
application that manages addresses for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an appointment
management application called *_Typee_*.


*_Typee_* is a CLI application that allows secretaries and receptionists to better schedule and
manage appointments. Receptionists and secretaries possess one of the fastest typing speeds and would get increased
productivity using the CLI-based *_Typee_*. The CLI application boosts productivity by having a comprehensive
appointment management system with calendar view, pdf report generation, as well as a typing game.

=== Major enhancement: added Game feature
** [red]#*_What it does:_* -# The game feature is a simple typing game where users score points whenever a word, such as
 `grass`, is correctly typed.

** [red]#*_Justification:_* -# The game feature is a utility feature that allows the user to improve their typing skill,
which is an essential skill for secretaries and receptionists. The game-like environment uses a points system and has the
advantage of keeping users incentivized and motivated to improve their skills.

** [red]#*_Highlights:_* -#
*** In-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to prevent users from creating multiple game instances.
The implementation was also challenging because there were various JavaFX API like `javafx.animation` and `javafx.beans`.

=== Minor enhancement: added `find` command
** [red]#*_What it does:_* -# Case-insensitive search for engagements based on the given keyword.

** [red]#*_Justification:_* -# The feature allows secretaries and receptionists to filter or search their list of engagements depending
on certain criteria. This allows them to better manage and schedule their appointments.

** [red]#*_Highlights_* -#
*** This enhancement complements existing as well as future commands.

=== Typing game : `tab b/game`
Changes the current window to the TypingGame window which has a kbd:[Start] button.

.Starting window of the TypingGame Window
image::StartWindow.png[width="400"]
Click the kbd:[Start] button to open the game in a new window.

There are moving words that you can type in order to score points. Once you correctly type the specified word,
the word disappears and the increase in points is reflected in the player information panel in the game window.

.Sample game play
image::GameWindow.png[width="300" float="left"]

.Sample game play when game is over
image::GameOver.png[width="300" float="left]

[TIP]
Press kbd:[SPACEBAR] or kbd:[Enter] to clear the text area which is located at the bottom of the screen.

When you fail to type the word before the moving word reaches the bottom of screen, the decrease in health points
is reflected in the player information panel in the game window.

[NOTE]
As the game progresses, the words move faster, hence increasing difficulty such that you can improve your typing speed.

[WARNING]
Closing the game midway would result in loss of in-game progress.

After the health points reaches zero, `GAME OVER` is displayed as shown below.


Once the game is over, you can manually close the application by clicking the kbd:[x] on the top right hand corner of the window.
If you want to play the game again, click the kbd:[Start] button shown in the Start window.

=== Game Feature
==== Implementation
The game feature is implemented using the singleton pattern using the singleton class `GameWindow` which is created
by button-click in `StartWindow`. This means that there can only be one `gameInstance` at any given time with the exception
of the game being over. The two diagrams below show the UML sequence diagram and activity diagram of the game window, which
gives a high level overview of the game.

.Summary Sequence Diagram of Game Window
image::GameSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
//image::GameActivityDiagram.png[float="left"]
image::GameActivityDiagram.png[width="50%" align="center"]
.Activity Diagram of the Game Window

`GameWindow` has three main components `PlayerInformation`, `GameBody` and `Player`.

.Structure of the Game Window
image::GameWindowClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The component `GameBody` makes use of `javafx.animation.AnimationTimer` API to continuously loop `MovingWords` objects moving from top
to bottom of the window using `GameBody#loopWords()`. `MovingWords` are created using
`HighlighterUtil#convertToTextFlowUsing(String word)`
, which appears as a `TextFlow` object of `javafx.scene.text` API.

Player input is represented as  a `javafx.beans.property.StringProperty` in `Player`.
Based on player input, `MovingWords` are updated using
`HighlighterUtil#convertToTextFlowUsing(String playerInput, String word)`
, which appears as a highlighted `TextFlow` object. In order to update the `MovingWords` object, the API
`javafx.animation.AnimationTimer` is used by calling `MovingWords#continuouslyUpdate()`.

The component `PlayerInformation` is bound to `Player` using `javafx.beans.property` API and is also updated when
`MovingWords#continuouslyUpdate()` is called.

The table below summarises the various purposes of the 3 main Game Window UI components.

|UI Component Type
|Feature
|Purpose

| `PlayerInformation`
| Scrollable Stack Pane
| Displays the user's score and health points.
| To inform user about the in-game progress.

| `GameBody`
| AnchorPane
| Displays the animation of the game.
| To allow the user to view the animation of the moving words in a continuous manner.

| `MovingWords`
| Scrollable Stack Pane
| Displays the individual word.
| To allow user to know the next word to type.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Singleton pattern design of Game Window

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Game Window with Singleton pattern design
** Pros: +
*** Prevent users from instantiating multiple Game Windows which may cause performance issues or even cause the application
to crash.
** Cons:
*** Reduced testability as it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs, and increased coupling across code base.

* **Alternative 2:** Game Window without Singleton pattern design
** Pros: Increased testability and reduced coupling.
** Cons: There could be the risk of users being able to instantiate hundreds or thousands of GameWindows which would cause
performance issues or application crash issues.
