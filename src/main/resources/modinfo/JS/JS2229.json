    "description": "This module surveys the fascinating development of Japanese civilization from prehistoric times to be present. Throughout our journey we will investigate and answer key questions about this intriguing civilisation. Where did the Japanese come from? What forces shaped Japanese society? How has Japan changed and interacted with the world? Rather than simple facts, the module will focus on processes and problems throughout Japanese history. Our aim will be to answer critical questions about the country. The module is for students of all disciplinary backgrounds who are interested in thinking about Japan.",
