    "description": "At the heart of this module is a sailing voyage. We will visit coastal/island communities, explore marine environment, and experience life at sea and on remote islands. During that time, as well as at pre- and postvoyage seminars, we will reflect on diverse but interrelated issues in historical and contemporary perspectives: the roles of the sea and boats in Southeast Asia; archipelagic spaces and nations; 'sea people' and territory; colonialism; piracy; interrelation between people and natural environment; ships and the sea in myths, narratives, and visual culture; seafaring as a method of understanding Southeast Asia, and so on.",
