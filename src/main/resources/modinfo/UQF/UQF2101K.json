    "description": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. This module uses the searching of romantic relationship as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of quantitative reasoning. Students will learn to use survey and data analysis to validate some claims about dating, and to investigate dating strategies from mathematical modelling. The cross-discipline potential of quantitative methods will be reviewed.",
