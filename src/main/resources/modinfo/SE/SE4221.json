    "description": "This module draws on insights from postcolonial criticism - a genre of writing that examines colonial practices, particularly, it exclusionary discourses and ambivalent interpretations - to rethink social categories and identities that constitute the political imaginings of postcolonial Southeast Asia. It explores how colonialist categories and knowledges on race, ethnicity, class, gender, culture/tradition and space return, in active forms, in the present, and how such \"\"survivals\"\" can be studied both historically and theoretically to reveal the connections between the political imaginings of the colonial and the postcolonial. It aims to: firstly, shed light on the politico-theoretical difficulties in the production of counter knowledges and counter histories in contemporary Southeast Asia; and secondly, unsettle conversations on the East-West divide by demonstrating the centrality of colonialism/postcolonialism in the making of the modern condition not only in the postcolonies but also in the metropole.",
