    "description": "This module aims to consider the principles of mechanics in a rigorous mathematical framework, and to establish a bridge to the principles of modern physics. The topics to be covered include: kinematics; damped and driven oscillators; energy and angular momentum, conservative forces; twobody and many-body problems, centre-of-mass; central-force motion, inverse square law, orbits, scattering; action principle; Lagrangian mechanics; Hamiltonian mechanics; small-amplitude oscillations, normal modes; rotating rigid bodies; rotating reference frames, centrifugal and Coriolis forces, Foucault's pendulum. A good command of calculus and some basic knowledge of linear algebra are required.",
