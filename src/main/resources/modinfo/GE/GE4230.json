By adopting an institutional analysis from new economic geographies, it examines the ways in which state formation (and transformation), business systems, organisational structures and socio\u2010cultural factors account for the geographical processes and outcomes of economic and political changes at various spatial scales. Issues covered include economic development and reforms, the financial and banking system, national business systems, financial crises, technology, foreign direct investment and international trade, governmentbusiness relations, mobility and urbanisation, and geopolitics.",
