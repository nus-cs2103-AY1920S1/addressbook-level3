    "description": "Pragmatics is the study of language in relation to context. As such, it deals broadly with the question of how communication takes place. For example, we can ask how it is possible for someone to say 'The door is open' and mean it as a request ('Close the door'). There are clearly cultural factors involved, but there also appear to be more universal principles of communication. This advanced module provides students with the opportunity to critically examine fundamental pragmatic concepts, and their theoretical relevance in explaining communicative behavior.",
