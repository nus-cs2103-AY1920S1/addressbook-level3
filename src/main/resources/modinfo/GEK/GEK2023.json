    "description": "The term Habitat encompasses a broad spectrum of living spaces including residences, places of work, surroundings and much more. In todays context, comfortable habitation is highly desired and this comfort could be derived easily with the help of modern technological advancements. However, the lack of knowledge of relevant technology and its application often results in either a compromised or a criticized habitat. Appreciation of the various concepts of technology and the knowledge of simple applications of these concepts could possibly be the only way to the end users of such spaces to avoid this situation. Thus, this module aims at delivering concepts of technology relevant to social living spaces (buildings) and enlightens on the application of the same through critical appreciation of actual design examples.",
