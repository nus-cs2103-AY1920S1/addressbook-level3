== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-API,*`API`*>>: Access data from an online database about Movies and Tv Shows.

Each of the five components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Ezwatchlist data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::markaswatched[]
=== [Feature] Mark/unmark as watched feature

The watch feature allows users to mark or unmark shows as watched. It also allows users to keep track of the latest episode
of a TV series that they have watched.

==== Implementation
The mark/unmark as watched mechanism is facilitated by `WatchCommand` which can be found under the commands package.
It extends `Command` and uses the `WatchCommandParser` to process the command entered by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark as watched mechanism works at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, and executes `watch 1 s/2 e/3` command to update the latest watched episode of the first show in the list.

Step 2. Entering the command calls `WatchListParser#parseCommand()`, which in turn returns a new `WatchCommandParser` and the `WatchCommandParser#parse()` command is called.

Step 3. A new `WatchCommand` is created, with the index of the show being parsed as a field of the `WatchCommand`. A new WatchShowDescriptor is also created to relay the episode number and season number to the WatchCommand object.

Step 4. The `WatchCommand#execute()` method is called, referencing the current `model`, and the show that is in the current `FilteredShowList` is referenced based off the current `model`.

[NOTE]
If the `index` is out of bounds, a new `CommandException` is thrown.

Step 5. A copy of the show is created through the use of `WatchCommand#createEditedShow()`, which determines the new total number of episodes watched from the given seasons and episodes.
A new isWatched value of the show is also determined based on the number of episodes that are watched.

Step 6. The show in the current show list is updated to the newly created copy with the updated watched status and latest episode watched, and a `CommandResult` with the new watched status of the show is created.

The following sequence diagram shows how the watch operation works:

image::WatchSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Creating a new WatchCommand instead of an altered EditCommand

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creating a new WatchCommand class for changing the 'watch' status of a show.
** Pros: Enables for greater cohesion since there is a specific command for editing the 'watch' status of a show.
** Cons: Requires longer code, and the code is also repetitive since its implementation is similar to that of the edit command
* **Alternative 2:** Use the WatchCommandParser to create a new EditCommand object that edits the watch status of the show.
** Pros: Less code repetition and shorter code in general.
** Cons: This will mean that there is less cohesion of the code and perhaps greater dependencies since more classes depend on the EditCommand class.
// end::markaswatched[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The statistics feature is facilitated by `Statistics` object. It extends `Ezwatchlist` with a summary of the users' personal
preferences and footprint including the most watched genre, shows that you might have forgotten to watch, and the
recommendations generated for you. It is stored internally as an `Statistics` object containing a `ModelManager`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Statistics#getFavouriteGenre()` -- Gives the genre that appears the most number of times in the list of watched shows.
* `Statistics#getForgotten()` -- Gives the 3 shows that were added the earliest but have not been watched.
* `Statistics#getRecommendation()` -- Gives 3 recommendations according to the watched shows.

Given below is a usage scenario of a user checking his/her statistics page.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The Statistics object will be initialized with ModelManager
containing the current watchlist and watched list. Behind the scenes, the 3 statistics will be calculated and the
statistics panel will be populated with the result.

Step 2. The user clicks on the statistic button and sees the content.

This is the sequence diagram of `getFavouriteGenre()`.

image::getFavouriteGenre.png[]

This is the sequence diagram of `getForgotten()`.

image::getForgotten.png[]

This is the sequence diagram of `getRecommendation()`.

image::getRecommendation.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes the workflow of Statistics:

image::activityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Statistics stores the watchlist and watched list

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the whole ModelManager as a field.
** Pros: Easy to implement and make use of.
** Cons: More dependency on ModelManager.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the watchlist and watched list as fields respectively.
** Pros: Less dependency on ModelManager.
** Cons: Less potential functionality and the lists might not be up-to-date.

===== Aspect: When the results are calculated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate when the application starts and update when there are changes.
** Pros: It appears more responsive in terms of navigating around the application.
** Cons: Need to constantly recalculate and update the results.
* **Alternative 2:** Calculate when the user navigate to Statistics panel.
** Pros: Less calculation needed.
** Cons: Appear less responsive.
// end::statistics[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Online Data

We are using https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api[The Movie Database (TMDB)] to retrieve information on movies and tv shows.

==== Implementation

All interactions with the third party library are facilitated by the interface `ApiInterface`. Methods in `ApiInterface` are the main
way the application retrieves any online information from the database.

*Methods in ApiInterface*

* `getMovieByName` : The method will return a list of movies in the database based on the name of the movie given
* `getTvShowByName` : The method will return a list of tv shows in the database based on the name of the tv show given
* `isConnected` : Checks if the application is connected online to the database

`ApiManager` is an implementation of `ApiInterface` and is done by using a https://github.com/holgerbrandl/themoviedbapi[java wrapper] for the TMDB api implemented by Holger Brandl.
Allowing us to retrieve information in the java code.

Given below is an example of how the application might want to retrieve movie information through `ApiInterface`.

Step 1. First an instance of a class implementing `ApiInterface` has to be created for the methods to be called. When `ApiManager` is instantiated the class api
key's is used to create a call to the TMDB API. All information retrieved must go through the class's api call.

Step 2. The method getMovieByName("Name Of Movie") is called and the api call searches the for the movie in the database with the name given.
A list of wrapped movies is given back, which is then read and used to create new instances of our application's `Show` model with information wrapped in classes such as
`Name`, `Description`, and `Actor`.

Step 3. To retrieve an image from the database, an image url is downloaded to the computer. The class `ImageRetrieval` does this. An
`ImageRetrieval` instance is created by the method for each image, and is downloaded to a root folder determined by `ImageRetrieval#defaultDirectory()`.

Step 4. A poster class is then created with the image path, to be used to load images in the application.

Step 5. With the list of movies returned, the application is given access to online information in a readable format.

[NOTE]
At any point the application might fail due to the application not being connected to the internet. If that occurs a
`OnlineConnectionException` is thrown for the application to handle.

The relationship between all the classes are shown in the following class diagram:
image:ApiClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Why this implementation was chosen

* **All API interactions would be in the API package and go through ApiInterface. **
** Pros:
- The application wouldn't have to seek access to the database on their own. The interface should provide all the functionality needed.
- Follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) that a module in the program should be encapsulated and have one repsponsibility.

==== Aspect: Image retrieval implementation
Images are retrieved through the `ImageRetrieval` class. Which downloads the image into the computer,
wrapping a `Poster` class with the local path of the image, for the application to access images.

===== Design Considerations
* ** Alternative 1 (current choice):** Download the image into the computer then access it locally on the computer.
** Pros:
*** Easier to keep track of images.
*** All images are retrieved the same way making it easier to implement showing the images.
** Cons:
*** All images shown are currently downloaded without being deleted, hence the amount of images downloaded can get unwieldy quickly, increasing
amount of memory used.
* **Alternative 2:** Parse the online url to the application for them to access the image online when needed.
** Pros:
*** No need for the images to be downloaded allows less memory to be used by the application.
** Cons:
*** Everytime the image is viewed, the application has to retrieve it from online making it more intensive on the network.
*** If the internet connection fails, the image can no longer be viewed.
//end::ImageRetrieval[]

==== Aspect: Recommendations
Recommendations are generated through the `RecommendationEngine` class in the API package. Currently,
recommendations are retrieved through the `ApiInterface` implemented in the API package.

===== Implementation
Given below is a _sequence diagram_ of how the current Statistics page's retrieves recommendations from the class.

.Sequence Diagram of getMovieRecommendations
image:getMovieRecommendationsSequenceDiagram.png[]


Step 1. First an instance of `RecommendationEngine` is created by passing in the list of movies the user has and the amount of recommendations to be given back.

Step 2. The method getMovieRecommendations is called in the object and the object will:

* Check if the list is valid to generate.
* Parse the list to get the same online entry in the database.
* Retrieve recommendations for each entry in the list.

Step 3. The recommendations are then sorted based on the amount of occurrences in appears in the recommendations.

Step 4. The top entries limited by the amount of recommendations requested is passed back in a sorted list.

Step 5. With the list of movies returned, the application can then display the movie recommendations back to the user.

[NOTE]
If no recommendations can be generated, a `NoRecommendationsExceptions` is thrown. Moreover, an
`OnlineConnectionException` is still thrown when not connected to the internet.




[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Implementation]]
=== [Feature] Search feature
==== Implementation
The `searchCommand` extends `Command` and uses `SearchCommandParser` to process the command entered by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `search n/Joker` command to search for a show with the name "Joker".

Step 2. Entering the command calls SearchCommandParser#parse().

Step 3. A new `SearchCommand` is created, with the list containing the name of the show to be searched as a field of `SearchCommand`.

Step 4. The `SearchCommand#execute()` method is called, referencing the current model.

Step 5. The `SearchCommand#searchByName()` method is called, referencing the current model.

Step 6. The `SearchCommand#addShowFromWatchListIfSameNameAs()` method is called, referencing the current model and name of search to be searched from the list of names.

Step 7. The `Model#getShowIfHasName()` method is called and any show with the name to be searched is added to the `filteredShowList`.

Step 8. The `SearchCommand#addShowToSearchResult()` method is called and shows from the `filteredShowList` is added to the `searchResult`.

Step 9. The `SearchCommand#addShowFromOnlineIfSameNameAs()` method is also called, referencing the name of show to be searched from the list of names.

[NOTE]
If the user is not connected online, a new `OnlineConnectionException` is thrown.

Step 10. The `SearchCommand#addOnlineMovieSearchedByNameToResults()` method is called, referencing the name of show to be searched.


//The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

//image::SearchSequenceDiagram.png[]

//_Figure 1: Sequence Diagram for `SearchCommand`_

The following activity diagram summarises the workflow of Search:

image::SearchActivityDiagram.png[]

_Figure 2: Activity Diagram of `SearchCommand`_

In Figure 2, the user first launches the app. After the user input a search command, the program runs and shows the list of shows found in the search page.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `SearchCommand` takes in the information to be searched for
** Current choice: Takes in a hash map from `SearchCommandParser` and gets the list of information to be searched for.
*** Pros: Easy to implement and make use of.
*** Cons: Certain list might be redundant as there might have no information in them.

===== Aspect: How Search searches for the shows
** Current choice: Checks if the user choose to search by name, actor or both, then filter them accordingly.
*** Pros: Easy to implement and make use of.
*** Cons: User has to input either a name or actor to be searched.
*** Cons: Logic is repetitive when searching based on actor or name.

=== [Feature] Add feature
==== Implementation
The `AddCommand` extends `Command` and uses `AddCommandParser` to process the command entered by the user.

There are two different ways of using add feature and both have different outcome.

1. Adding show in the WatchList.
2. Adding show found from online search.

Given below is an example usage of scenario 1 and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `add n/Joker...` command to add a show in the WatchList with the name "Joker".

Step 2. Entering the command calls AddCommandParser#parse().

Step 3. A new `AddCommand` is created, with the show to be added in AddCommand.

Step 4. The `AddCommand#execute()` method is called, referencing the current model and add the show given by user to the `filteredShowList` found in model.


The following activity diagram summarises the workflow of Add:

image::AddActivityDiagram.png[]

_Figure 3: Activity Diagram of `AddCommand`_

In Figure 3, the user first launches the app. After the user input a add command, the program runs and add the show input by user into WatchList.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `AddCommand` executes
** Current choice: Create a show object and add it to a `filteredShowList` found in ModelManager.
*** Pros: Easy to implement and make use of.
*** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.


Given below is an example usage of scenario 2 and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user uses the search(Online) command and executes `add INDEX` command to add a show from search result page of INDEX in the WatchList.

Step 2. Entering the command calls AddCommandParser#parse().

Step 3. A new `AddCommand` is created, with the show to be added in AddCommand.

Step 4. The `AddCommand#execute()` method is called, referencing the current model and add the show given by user to the `searchList` of INDEX found in model.


The following activity diagram summarises the workflow of Add:

image::AddActivityDiagram2.png[]

_Figure 4: Activity Diagram of `AddCommand`_

In Figure 4, User input search(online) command. User then input `add INDEX` command. Show of INDEX found in search result page is added to WatchList.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `AddCommand` executes
** Current choice: Retrieve the show object found in `searchList` of INDEX from ModelManager and add it to `filteredShowList`.
*** Pros: Easy to implement and make use of.
*** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

// tag::sync[]
=== [Feature] Synchronise user's show data

The synchronise feature allows user to sync a show found in watchlist with online searched show data. It modifies all of the
parameters/information is user selected show with online searched show data. +
User may have added their show with their own information. However, user might not know some of the parameters such as actors.
Thus, user can use the search online command `search n/` to look up information regarding that show. +
Then, Synchronise command `sync` can be used to update information/modify on that show.

==== Implementation

The Synchronise feature is facilitated by `SyncCommand` object which can be found under the commands package.
It extends `Command` and uses the `SyncCommandParser` to process the command entered by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Synchronise command work as Sync mechanism works at each step.

Pre-Condition: User has already added a certain show into watchlist manually. That show must have at least `name` and `type` parameters.
Example of Pre-Condition: User has added Titanic movie into watchlist.

Step 1. The user launches the application, go to Search page and execute `search n/titanic`.

Step 2. The user execute `sync 1` command to synchronise index 1 of result page with a show in watchlist with same name (case-insensitive).

Step 3. Entering the command calls `SyncCommandParser#parseCommand()`, which in turn returns a new `SyncCommandParser` and the `SyncCommandParser#parse()` command is called.

Step 4. A new `SyncCommand` is created, with the index of the show being parsed as a field of the `SyncCommand`.

Step 5. The `SyncCommand#execute()` method is called, referencing the current `model`, and the show that is in the current `FilteredShowList` is referenced based off the current `model`.

[NOTE]
If the `index` is out of bounds, a new `CommandException` is thrown.

Step 6. A list of shows found in search page and watchlist are retrieved from `model`. The show according to the Index of the `searchpagelist` are retrieved as well.
Then, the list of show in watchlist will be checked through to match the name of the index show.

Step 7. If a show in watchlist matched with the name of the index show, `model.setShow` will be called to replace the show found in watchlist with index show.
`CommandResult` will be return which contains information regarding the feedback result. Else, `CommandException` is thrown to notify user no similar show name is found in watchlist as index show.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sync operation works:

image::SyncSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarises the workflow of Sync:

image::SyncActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Creating a new Synchronise instead of an altered EditCommand and AddCommand

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creating a new Synchronise class for replace information of a certain show found in search page with one in watchlist.
** Pros: Enables for greater cohesion since there is a specific command for replacing/modifying information of a show in watchlist.
** Cons: Requires longer code, and the code is also repetitive since its implementation is similar to that of the add and edit command
* **Alternative 2:** Use the SyncCommandParser to create a new EditCommand object that edits the information of a certain show found in search page with one in watchlist.
** Pros: Less code repetition and shorter code in general.
** Cons: This will mean that there is less cohesion of the code and perhaps greater dependencies since more classes depend on the EditCommand class.
