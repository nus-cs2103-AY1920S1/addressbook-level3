    "description": "International Business & Internationalisation looks at the process for a firm to become international in its operations and sales, as well as the subsequent management challenges associated with operating in multiple geographic markets. The module complements the macro-economic principles covered in BME5050 in its analytical focus on other elements of business environments, such as the political, regulatory and social environments, that shape the nature and conduct of business in Asia and in the world. The module will further extend these core analytical elements through a consideration of the role of multilateral institutions (e.g., IMF, Asian Development Bank) and prominent national institutions on internationalisation strategy and multinational management.",
