    "description": "Alongside the European Union the Asia-Pacific is becoming the central arena for trade and investment and its contestation within the world today. This module examines the global, regional and bilateral frameworks governing trade, investment, competition and migration across this region. It has three components. The first looks at how different organisations and regimes \u2013 the WTO, ASEAN, ASEAN Plus Agreements, BITS, NAFTA and Closer Economic Relations \u2013 interact to govern the region and the attempts to reform this, most notably through the TransPacific Partnership Process. The second looks at the detailed laws and processes governing trade in goods and services and investment. The final section looks at a number of further key policies: intellectual property, competition, the professions, and migration.",
