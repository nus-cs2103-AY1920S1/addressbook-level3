    "description": "What makes diverse people a nation? Though no single answer covers all nations or nationalisms, analysts agree that modern nations are less a natural formation than a construction in need of constant upkeep. Art can and does play a role here. This module introduces several theories of nationalism and of art on the understanding that these discourses do not mesh easily. This module fosters probing interdisciplinary comprehension of potential intersections between nation-building and paintings, music, photography, poems and a great deal more.",
