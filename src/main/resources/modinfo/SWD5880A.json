    "description": "The involvement of service users in social work is challenging. This module will study service user involvement from service user, theoretical and practical perspectives and hence, identify barriers, possibilities and challenges in participatory processes. Special importance will be placed on power relations and power theories. To develop service user involvement social workers need tools and knowledge. A central part of this is establishing connections between social work practice and research. Hence, the module will also focus on the possibilities of using practice research \u2013 a research approach aiming at developing practice through collaborative processes involving social workers, service users and researchers.",
