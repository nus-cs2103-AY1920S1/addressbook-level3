    "description": "Japan and Southeast Asia share a complex history of interactions. Looking at issues such as early migration and trade relationships, the occupation during the Pacific War, production networks, development aid and free trade agreements, or the enthusiastic reception of Japanese products including anime, television drama and food allow us to build an understanding of the dynamics of relationships in Asia. This will be done by first introducing the key issues and then focusing on either popular culture, international business, international relations, or Japanese migration to different regions of Southeast\nAsia. The module will be complemented by a fieldtrip to Southeast Asia.",
