    "description": "Model opera is a prominent cultural component of China\u2019s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. The eight model operas were believed to embody Mao's dictum that art should serve politics. This course studies these model operas in their historical context whilst examining them as modes of cultural production which stand at the intersection of history, artistry and aesthetics. Amongst other things, it examines political messages and their realisation in rigorously formulated artistic choices. Primary materials will include scripts and historical video recordings of model opera performances, propaganda materials and political documents.",
