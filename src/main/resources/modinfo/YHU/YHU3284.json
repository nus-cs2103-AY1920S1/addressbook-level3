    "description": "This course provides opportunity for engaging with postcoloniality as a cultural and literary phenomenon with a complex historical legacy and a contemporary relevance that links otherwise diverse contemporary societies and literary traditions. Through a close engagement with documents of cultural history as well as representative texts in all the literary genres, selected from across the former colonies of Europe (and including reference to the US administration of the Philippines during the first half of the 20thc century), this module will give students the opportunity to engage with the issue of what it means, and why it matters, in the words of Ngugi was Thiong\u2019o, to 'decolonise the mind.'",
