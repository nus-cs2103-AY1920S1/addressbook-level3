    "description": "Credit is the lifeblood of any modern economy, but as the extension of credit carries risks, creditors take security to protect themselves. But that in turn poses challenges for corporate insolvency law. How should the rights conferred by security be dealt with in an insolvency? Further, what are the mechansims that creditors, secured or otherwise, may use to deal with an insolvent company? Major topics to be covered include general concepts of secured transactions, specific security and quasi-security devices over chattels and choses in action, the main themes of corporate rescue law and corporate rescue mechansims.",
