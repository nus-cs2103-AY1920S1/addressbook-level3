    "description": "This module introduces various multiphase processes that are important to Chemical Engineering applications. These include sedimentation, flow through packed beds, filtration, fluidisation, pneumatic transport and cyclone separation. The concepts of single particle terminal velocity and hindered settling velocity in multiple particle systems are introduced and applied to engineering designs of continuous settling systems. Principles of flow through packed beds are discussed and applied towards engineering designs of filtration and fluidized bed systems. Pressure drop calculations for pneumatic transport systems and engineering design calculations for gas cyclone systems are discussed. The module concludes with the study of crystallisation, colloids and nanoparticles.",
