== Introduction

This developer guide describes the software architecture and implementation details of the software, ModuleBook. It is intended to be read by developers and software testers for the software.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add CS2103T`.

.Component interactions for `add CS2103T` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HomeViewPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModuleBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add CS2103T")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `Add CS2103T` Command
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the ModuleBook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `TrackedModule` data in json format and read it back.
* can read the `ArchivedModule` data from json format.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.module.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::moduleview[]
=== Module View Feature

The module view feature allows users to view a module to access extra information about the module. The user can view (and unview) a module using the `view` (and `back`) commands.

==== Implementation
The module view feature is facilitated by `displayedModule` in `ModelManager`. The following describes how the `displayedModule` is modified and read to the `Ui`.

. The user enters a view command in the `Ui`.

. `LogicManager` parses the user input, constructs and executes the `ViewCommand`.

. The `ViewCommand` attempts to find the matching module from the list of Tracked Modules, else it attempts to find the matching module from the list of Archived Modules, else it throws an exception.

. The `ViewCommand` sets the `displayedModule` in the `Model` and returns the `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`.

. The `LogicManager` returns the `CommandResult` to the `Ui`.

. The `Ui` gets the `displayedModule` from `LogicManager` and updates the Ui to display the module.

The following sequence diagram shows how the module view feature is executed.

.Module View Sequence Diagram
image::ModuleViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The `BackCommand` mostly follows the same sequence as described above, except that it does not need to find any module, and sets the displayed module to `null`.

The following activity diagram describes the process of finding a matching module to display.

.Activity Diagram of module finding process
image::ModuleViewFindModuleActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Updating the Ui

**Current Implementation**: New field in the `CommandResult` that the Ui will check to determine if it needs to update.

Pros:

* Simple and easy to control what command updates the Ui.

Cons:

* More difficult to maintain over the course of the project. New Ui elements require new fields to update the Ui.

**Alternate Implementation**: Every command updates the Ui.

Pros:

* Maintainance free.

Cons:

* Potentially inefficient.
* Possible side effects from certain commands.
// end::moduleview[]

// tag::markmodulestatus[]
=== [Proposed] Marking modules as completed, ongoing or planned

Users can mark modules as pass:[<text style="color:darkgreen"><b>completed</b></text>], pass:[<text style="color:darkorange"><b>ongoing</b></text>] or pass:[<text style="color:blue"><b>planned</b></text>]. Users can also timestamp the modules with the semester that the user pass:[<text style="color:darkgreen"><b>has taken</b></text>]/pass:[<text style="color:darkorange"><b>is taking</b></text>]/pass:[<text style="color:blue"><b>will take</b></text>] the module.

==== Implementation

The tracked module will have 2 new fields: `moduleStatus` and `semesterTimestamp`.

The `moduleStatus` will be an enumeration of:

* pass:[<text style="color:darkgreen"><b>completed</b></text>],
* pass:[<text style="color:darkorange"><b>ongoing</b></text>] and
* pass:[<text style="color:blue"><b>planned</b></text>].

The `semesterTimestamp` will be a combination of:

* an academic year
** In NUS, the academic year representation is prefixed with "AY", followed by the last 2 digits of the starting year, and the last 2 digits of the ending year
** e.g. AY1920, AY2021

* a semester
** In NUS, there are a total of 4 semesters. Semester 1, Semester 2, Special Term 1 (ST1) and Special Term 2 (ST2).
** e.g. 1, 2, ST1, ST2

The user will be free to modify the `moduleStatus` and the `semesterTimestamp`. The following class diagram will illustrate the above implementation.

.Possible implementation of Module Status
image::ModuleStatusClassDiagram.png[]

==== Possible Extensions

With the new data, users may be able to easier manage their tracked modules and gleam useful information.

. pass:[<text style="color:darkgreen"><b>Completed modules</b></text>] will be hidden from the module list, but still viewable through a `listall` command (proposed command) and accessible through the `view` command.

. pass:[<text style="color:darkgreen"><b>Completed modules</b></text>] and pass:[<text style="color:darkorange"><b>ongoing modules</b></text>] can be used to determine if a user fulfil the requirements for their pass:[<text style="color:blue"><b>planned modules</b></text>].
// end::markmodulestatus[]

// tag::searchfiltering[]
=== Search filtering feature
==== Implementation

The search filtering feature Uses different categories of predicates
to narrow down the search space of the archived module list. The user is able to able to combine different categories
of search to find modules that passes all the user defined filters. This can be achieved through the use of `Predicate`
which can be chained with additional predicates and applied to a `FilteredList`. This requires additional predicate classes that searches their individual fields
for the keywords.:

* `ModuleCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests that a `module` module code matches any of the keywords given.
* `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests that a `module` title contains all of the keywords given.
* `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests that a `module` description contains all of the keywords given.
* `PrerequisiteContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests that a `module` prerequisites matches any of the keywords given.
* `PreclusionContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests that a `module` preclusions matches any of the keywords given.
* `SemesterContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests that a `module` semester matches any of the keywords given.

.Activity diagram for search predicates.
image::SearchActivityDiagram.png[]

The figure above shows how each predicate checks for the keyword. Do note that `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate`
and `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` requires their specified field to contain *all* of the keywords, while the rest of the
predicates returns true as long as their field contains *at least one* of the keyword.

The user is able to use any combination of filters and the order of input should not matter. Examples of valid find commands:

****
* `find mod\ cs2` : Should display a list of modules with module code containing "cs2"
* `find mod\ cs2 prereq\ cs2040` : Should display a list of modules with module code containing "cs" and with prerequisite of "cs2040"
****

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation wold work:

.Sequence diagram for search filtering.
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

As represented in the figure above, when a `FindCommandParser` is constructed by `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand`, the `FindCommandParser` would construct a list
of `Predicate<module>` based on the parsed arguments, which is used to construct a `FindCommand`.

During the execution of `FindCommand#execute()`, each predicate is chained and applied to the `FilteredList`.

Finally, a `FilteredList` of `Modules` that passes all of the filters will be displayed.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Requirements.

* **Module field requirements:** Information from the `archivedModules.json` would have to be abstracted out
as individual fields in the `ArchivedModule` object.
** *pros:* Added fields can be used for future developments.
** *cons:* Can potentially slow down `Module` construction and operations due to increased size for each `Module` object.

===== Aspect: Fuzzy search.

* **Search with spelling mistake tolerance:** Due to the potential of spelling mistakes within fields such as the module
and module discription which does not rely on module codes, searching these fields can accept mistakes with a degree of 2
Levenshtein Distance from any of the original intended word.
** *pros*: Much more robust searching potential.
** *cons*: Will slow down the search.

===== Aspect: Incremental development.

* **Adding new search filters:** Developing and integrating new filters.
** *pros:* Filters can be developed independently and incrementally, filters can be integrated based on priority.
** *pros:* Can be further adapted to search fields from `Deadline` and `Links`.
// end::searchfiltering[]

// tag::deadline[]
=== Deadline Management Feature

As a module management system, one of the important features will be the management of deadlines for each modules.

This section will elaborate the current implementation and design considerations of deadline management feature.

==== Current implementation

The deadline management feature supports the following main operations.

* `add` - adds a new deadline task to the respective module.

* `edit` - edits the description or date and time of deadline task.

* `done` - marks a deadline task as done.

* `doneAll` - marks all the deadline tasks as done.

* `inProgress` - marks a deadline task as inProgress.

* `undone` - marks a deadline task as undone

* `delete` - deletes an existing task from the deadline list.

* `deleteAll` - deletes the entire deadline list from a module.

The following activity diagram summarises what happened when a user executes the AddDeadlineCommand:

.Activity Diagram for the execution of AddDeadlineCommand.
image::AddDeadlineActivityDiagram.png[]

The format to add deadline command is as follows:

....
deadline 2 a/add d/description t/dateAndTime p/priority
....

The add deadline mechanism is facilitated by `AddDeadlineCommand` and `AddDeadlineCommandParser`.
It takes in the following input from the user: `MODULE_LIST_NUMBER`, `DESCRIPTION`, `DATE_AND_TIME` and
`PRIORITY` which will construct a Deadline object to be added to the deadline list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how add deadline mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes:

....
deadline 2 a/add d/do homework t/2/12/2019 1645 p/MEDIUM
....

Step 2. `LogicManager` would use `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse input from the user.

Step 3. `ModuleBookParser` would determine which command is being used and creates the respective parser.
In this case, `DeadlineCommandParser` is being created from the COMMAND.WORD: `deadline` and
the user’s input would be passed in as a parameter.

Step 4. `DeadlineCommandParser` would then determine which action is being used and creates the respective parser.
In this case, `AddDeadlineCommandParser` is created and user's input would be parsed.

Step 5. `AddDeadlineCommandParser` would do a validation check on the user’s input before creating
and returning a `AddDeadlineCommand` with `index` and `Deadline` as its attributes. `index` represents
the `TrackedModule` list index (i.e 2) which the `Deadline` object will be added to.

Step 6. `LogicManager` would execute `AddDeadlineCommand#execute()`,
checks whether there is an existing module,
then adds to the `TrackedModule`.

Step 7. `AddDeadlineCommand` would return a `CommandResult`
to the `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the add deadline operation works:

.Sequence Diagram diagram for AddDeadlineCommand.
image::AddDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Data Structure used to support add command

*  Alternative 1(Current choice) : Use of `ArrayList` to store deadline tasks in a `TrackedModule`.
** Pros: Commands (eg. edit, sort, delete) can be easily supported
by a list operations.
** Pros: Ensures that only one deadline list is maintained for each TrackedModule.
** Cons: More difficult to maintain over the course of the project.
New commands(eg. done, priority) need to edit and maintain the list constantly.
** Cons: Duplicate deadline tasks harder to identify.

*  Alternative 2 : Use a `HashSet` to store deadline tasks in a `TrackedModule`.
** Pros: Duplicate deadline tasks can be identified easily.
** Cons: Not easy to identify tasks using index.
// end::deadline[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Link Management Feature

The link management feature allows users to add and manage a set of website links that will be associated with a given module.

==== Implementation

The link management feature is facilitated by the `link` class.

Each `link` object is stored in an `ArrayList<Link>`, which in turn is stored in its corresponding `TrackedModule`.

The link feature currently supports add, delete, edit and launch commands.

An example usage scenario of an *add link* operation is given below and the behavior of the link management feature is shown.

1. The user launches the application with an existing save file. `ModuleBook` is initialized with existing `TrackedModule`.

2. The user inputs `link MODULE_INDEX a/add n/LINK_NAME l/LINK_URL` to add a link with name `LINK_NAME`, linked to `LINK_URL` to the `TrackedModule` with the corresponding `MODULE_INDEX`.

3. `LogicManager` receives user input and parses it using `ModuleBookParser#parseCommand()`.  `ModuleBookParser` reads the `COMMAND_WORD` and identifies the input as a `Link` related command and passes the input to `LinkCommandParser`.

4. `LinkCommandParser` determines the `add` action required through the `a/` prefix argument. It then proceeds to pass the relevant input to  `AddLinkCommandParser`.

5. `AddLinkCommandParser` checks for the validity of `LINK_URL` given by the user and creates the relevant `Link` and `AddLinkCommand` objects.

6. `AddLinkCommand` calls `Model#get(MODULE_INDEX)` to find the required module. If it does not exist or is not currently tracked, `AddLinkCommand` throws a `CommandException`. Otherwise, it then proceeds to call `TrackedModule#hasLinkTitle(LINK_NAME)` to check for an existing `Link` object with the same `LINK_NAME`.

7. If such a `Link` object exists, `AddLinkCommand` aborts and throws a `CommandException`. Otherwise, the created `Link` will be added to the specified `TrackedModule`.

8. If the operation is successful, a `CommandResult` with the success message will be returned.

.Sequence diagram for add link operation
image::AddLinkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Reference of add link to module function from sequence diagram shown above
image::AddLinkCommandSequenceDiagramExtension.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Data structure used for link management

* Alternative 1 (current choice): All `TrackedModule` maintain a `ArrayList<Link>`. Adding `Link` objects will add to this `ArrayList`.

** Pros: Easy to implement and edit for beginner programmers.

** Cons: Accessing and editing existing `Link` might be less efficient. If number of `Link` objects maintained increases, `ArrayList` may not be optimal.

* Alternative 2: Use `HashSet<Link>` to maintain `Link` in each `TrackedModule`

** Pros: Reduces access time, since `Link` objects can be obtained by giving `LINK_TITLE`, rather than searching the list linearly for a matching object.

** Cons: Difficult to add features. Future implmentations may add a `Priority` feature to `Link` objects. `HashSet` does not support any form of sorting and thus may pose a problem.
