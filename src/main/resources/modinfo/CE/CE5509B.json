    "description": "The primary objective of this module is to equip participants with sufficient design knowledge and skills on steel\u2010concrete composite structures in their engineering career. This module provides participants with fundamental approaches in designing structural steel\u2010concrete components and buildings. The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to perform structural design for composite beams, slabs, columns, joints, multi\u2010storey buildings. This enables the participants to conceive a safe and economical structural system. The module is targeted at practicing engineers, post\u2010graduate civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on structural design.",
