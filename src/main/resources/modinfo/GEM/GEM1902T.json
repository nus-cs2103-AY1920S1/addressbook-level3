    "description": "Since the nineteenth century, artistic practice has been aligned with ways of thinking about society and the potential to change it. Using contemporary and historical examples from different continents, this module explores the always\u2010evolving relationship between art and social change. How do artists respond to technological, economical, and political developments in society? How do advocates for social change refer to art as a source of inspiration or a form to bring about change? Students will approach these questions by examining works of art in relation to the artist and the audience, and by considering the institutionalization and commercialization of art.",
