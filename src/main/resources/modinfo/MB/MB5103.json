    "description": "This module, required for doctoral students in Mechanobiology, studies the scientific seminar as a mode of communication, as well as studying a variety of mechanobiology topics that will be presented in seminar format. Students will have opportunities to work on 1) extracting information from research seminars; 2) critical listening; 3) constructive criticism and identifying areas for improvement; and 4) presenting a brief seminar on material directly related to their own research. Seminars will be presented by visiting scientists, members of the RCE, and the students themselves. Seminars are an effective way for students to interact with the broader scientific community and to keep abreast of the most recent research. The ultimate goal for this module is to enable students to get the greatest benefit from research seminars, whether they are participating as audience members or as speakers.",
