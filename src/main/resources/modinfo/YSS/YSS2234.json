    "description": "What is the purpose of a company? Is it only to make money? The Good Company will investigate the changing nature of the modern corporation and its impact on society, both good and bad. We will also develop an understanding of ethical investments and the role such firms play in impacting the behaviour of modern corporations. Shortcomings in the current ethical investment framework will be covered, with a new paradigm (The Good Company Index) analysed as an alternative.",
