By examining different approaches to oral and written argument, students will develop the ability to conceptualise and present legal concepts in a manner appropriate to a variety of venues including administrative tribunals, egional and international bodies, and alternative dispute resolution vehicles, in a manner that will help prepare them for a global legal practice.",
