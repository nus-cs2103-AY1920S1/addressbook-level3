Jarvis was developed by the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu] team.
We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

=== Anisha Joseph - Project Portfolio for Jarvis

=== About the Project
`Jarvis` was developed by a group of 5 students (including myself) from NUS School of Computing (Computer Science) as
part of a module - CS2103T Software Engineering. The module specifications were to morph a basic command line
interface desktop addressbook application into an application that manages any type of data of our choosing. As such,
we decided to create a student life organiser, that manages students' tasks, finances, courses and co-curricular
activities (CCA). Students can better organise the major aspects of their student life through the
`Task Planner`, `Finance Tracker`, `CCA Tracker` and `Course Planner` features of `Jarvis`.

As seen above in Figure 1, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of `Jarvis` has four tabs, each
dealing a different feature. I had built the `Planner` feature of `Jarvis`. The following sections will illustrate my
various contributions to this project, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and
developer guides regarding my feature.


=== Summary of Contributions

This section includes a brief overview of my coding, documentation and other key
contributions to the team in building `Jarvis`.

===== Feature added: `Planner`

* *Purpose*: The `Planner` feature enables students to effortlessly manage all their tasks.
As `Jarvis` is a student life organiser, this feature is central to the whole application.

* *Highlights*:
  ** There are three types of tasks in the `Planner` - `Todo`, `Deadline` and `Event`. `Todo` tasks have a description
only, `Deadline` tasks have a due date, and `Event` tasks have a start and end date. This allows for greater
flexibility when adding different types of tasks to the `Planner`.

  ** Each task *may* be set with a priority and frequency level in order to better reflect the true nature of the tasks
the user is adding. Tasks *may* also be tagged with customisable tags for easier sorting.

  ** Tasks in the planner can be sorted by tags, priority levels, frequency levels, task type or even date. This
greatly helps students manage tasks and tackle each one in whatever order they please.

  ** The `Planner` has a `schedule` section which displays the tasks for the day and week, thus helping users view
the most urgent tasks that might not have been done yet.

=== Contributions to the User Guide
Given that `Jarvis` is nothing like the original addressbook that we were given, we had to update it to match our
current application. We were each responsible for adding the commands for the features that we were in charge of
building.

The following is an excerpt from our *Jarvis User Guide*, detailing the additions that I have made for the `Planner`.

==== Task Planner

A digital planner to help you stay organized; `Jarvis` can help you cope with your interminable lists of deadlines,
events, errands and more. Tagging and prioritizing tasks are just two of the many ways `Jarvis` will
enable you to stay on top of everything you need to do!

.GUI for the Task Planner
image::ug/PlannerUI.png[]

{sp} +

The Planner feature of `Jarvis` has a very intuitive user interface, with three main sections - as seen in Figure 3.

Each task is represented by a task card (an example of which is boxed in green in Figure 3). Each task card has the task
description right at the top, followed by the task type, and the optional fields (if present). The icon at the bottom
of each task card indicates whether a task has been done, or not - a red cross for tasks that have not been completed
and a green tick for tasks that have.

The default display ia a column on the left for all the tasks in the planner, and a column on the right for your
schedule. The schedule consists two lists stacked on top of each other - the top one showing tasks happening on that
day and the bottom showing tasks happening that week.

==== Adding a task: `add-task`
The most fundamental command for the Planner - `add-task` adds a task to the Planner.

[[link-attributes]]
A task *must* have a:

* `TASK-TYPE`: `todo`, `event` or `deadline`
* `TASK-DESCRIPTION`: a short description of the task
* `DATE` (for `Event` and `Deadline` tasks only)

A task *may* have the following *attributes*:

* `TAG`: any number of tags, such as `#school` or `#cca`
* `PRIORITY` level: `high`, `medium` or `low`
* `FREQ` frequency: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` or `yearly`

You can refer to the table below for a brief overview of the different command formats for the
different types of tasks.

|===
| Task Type | Format

|`Todo`
|`add-task t/todo des/TASK-DESCRIPTION [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`

|`Event`
|`add-task t/event des/TASK-DESCRIPTION d/START-DATE//END-DATE [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`

|`Deadline`
|`add-task t/deadline des/TASK-DESCRIPTION d/DUE-DATE [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`
|===

NOTE: Duplicate tasks are not allowed in the Planner!

===== Example
----
add-task t/event des/workshop f/weekly d/25/12/2019//26/12/2019
add-task t/deadline des/cs2101 assignment d/20/9/2019 p/high
----

And as simple as that, `Jarvis` can begin to keep track of
your tasks for you!

=== Contributions to the Developer Guide
Similarly, we required a major overhaul of the addressbook's developer guide to adapt it for our own use.

This section contains an excerpt from our *Jarvis Developer Guide* for the `Planner feature`.

==== Implementation

The `Planner` contains a `TaskList`, which in turn, contains a number of tasks
a user has. Each task has a `TaskType` and `Status` and may also have a `Priority` level,
`Frequency` level and any number of `Tag` objects.

A simple outline of the `Planner` can be seen below, in Figure 26.

.Overview of the entire Planner
image::plannermodel.png[align=left]


The `Model` in `Jarvis` extends `PlannerModel` which facilitates all operations
necessary to carry out commands by the user.

* `Model#getPlanner()` -- Returns an instance of a `Planner`.

* `Model#addTask(int zeroBasedIndex, Task task` -- Adds a `Task` to the
planner at the specified `Index`.

* `Model#addTask(Task t)` -- Adds a `Task` to the `Planner`. Since no `Index`
is specified, the `Task` is appended to the end of the `TaskList`.

* `Model#deleteTask(Index index)` -- Deletes the `Task` at the specified
  `Index` from the `Planner`.

* `Model#deleteTask(Task t)` -- Deletes the specified `Task` from the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#size()` -- Returns the total number of `Task` objects in the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#hasTask(Task t)` -- Checks if a given `Task` is already in the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#markTaskAsDone(Index i)` - Changes the `Status` of a `Task` at the given
`Index` from `DONE` to `NOT_DONE`

* `Model#getTasks()` -- Returns the `TaskList` in the `Planner`.

* `Model#getTask(Index index)` - Retrieves the `Task` at the specified `Index` of
the `TaskList`

* `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` - Updates the `FilteredList` in the
`Planner` according to the given `Predicate`.

* `Model#updateSchedule()` - Updates the `FilteredList` of `Task` objects whose dates coincide with
the current date.

* `Model#getUnfilteredTaskList()` - Returns an `ObservableList<Task>` of all the `Task` objects
in the `Planner`.

* `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` - Returns an `ObservableList<Task>` of all the `Task` objects in
the `FilteredList`.

* `Model#getTasksToday()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of the list of `Task` objects that coincide with
the current day, backed by the `FilteredList` of `Planner`

* `Model#getTasksThisWeek()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of the list of `Task` objects that coincide with
the current week, backed by the `FilteredList` of `Planner`.

One example of the interaction between the `Model` and commands for the `Planner` can be seen when the user
executes a `pull-task` command.

.Sequence Diagram for pull-task command
image::PullTaskSequenceDiagram.png[align=left]

In the figure above, `pull-task` will result in the filtered lists in the `Planner` to be updated according to
the appropriate predicates. In this case, the predicate called will be `TaskPredicateMatchesPredicate` as the
user had specified a `pull-task` according to the `Priority` levels of the `Task` objects.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Task Descriptions in a Task

* **Option 1 (Current choice):** As a string attribute in `Task`

** Pros: Intuitive, easy to implement, less code required

** Cons: Provides a lower level of abstraction, especially if an `edit-task`
command is implemented

* **Option 2:** Building a separate `TaskDescription` class

** Pros: Higher level of abstraction

** Cons: More code, will take time to replace current methods that deal with
String `TaskDes` directly

Ultimately, we decided on Option 1 as there are no limitations on what a description of
a `Task` should be (other than not _null_). Further more, there is no manipulation of the
Task Description at the current stage of `Jarvis`, hence there is no real need to provide an
additional layer of abstraction for it. If we do intend to continue developing `Jarvis` in
the future, however, Option 2 might be a viable choice.
