In this course, we seek to understand and appreciate consumers as unique individuals and as members of their social and cultural groups. We will examine the many facets of consumer behavior (e.g., from the experiential perspective, incorporating insights from sociology and anthropology), with an emphasis on symbolic forms of consumption, and the use of qualitative research methods.",
