== PROJECT: AddMin+

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop
addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into an employee records management
cum communication system called AddMin+. This enhanced application enables office managers to file and recall employee
data; manage employee work schedule and leave application;
and email employees directly without opening an email application.

This is what our project looks like:

._The graphical user interface for AddMin+._

My role was to design and write the codes for the fetch and allocate features. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added features to allow association of employees with events which includes
*automated/manual allocation of employees to event commands* and a *deallocate command*, as well as the
viewing of changes the users made via the *fetch event* command. All related commands have *GUI features* implemented.

** What it does: allows the user to check for availability of employees and allocate them to an event with
certain filter requirements. The algorithm ensures that employees cannot be allocated to events with
conflicting time periods.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now allocate employees
to events, which is a key component for events management companies that our app is targeting.
The GUI features further provide convenience for users.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it
required the knowledge of both `Event` and `Employee` classes.

* *Minor enhancement*: added command history to allow user to view previous commands using up/down
arrow keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Ensured integration of various components (e.g. storage, logic, model) during the morphing phase.
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated GUI to show both employee and event list
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
