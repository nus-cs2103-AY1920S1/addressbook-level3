    "description": "This module is designed to provide the student with an introduction to the nature and history of urban transportation. Transportation is far more than how we get around. It determines not only the shape of cities, but more importantly economic, social and environmental outcomes. Urban transportation problems will be explored in the context of general economic, social, and spatial trends. Substantive topics to be addressed include economic land use models and how they account for transport systems, behavioralist understandings of travel, private and public transportation, environmental problems, and the relationship between transport and social opportunity.",
