    "description": "Religion in Public Life concerns the intersection of religion and society and the role of religion in the officially secular state of Singapore. Students will study how religion is discussed in both academic and popular literatures and examine how religious organizations present themselves in order to participate in discussions of social, political or economic importance. The module will include a fieldwork component that will provide students with the data needed to write meaningful research papers based on real sites in Singapore. As a WCT Course, this module will give students the skills to produce rhetorically effective academic writing.",
