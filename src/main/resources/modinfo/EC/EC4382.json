As an applied area of microeconomics, the course focuses on demand, production and costs, pricing and investment, and competition and regulation. The course will apply theories in a variety of contexts so that students will gain valuable insights into the particular characteristics of transport modes. Assessment tasks will be designed to allow students to explore these matters in depth.",
