== CS2103T Team Project: Dukemon

image::subbashcontentpageA1.png[width=300]


Dukemon is a desktop flashcard application used to reinforce memory techniques. The user interacts with it using a CLI (Command Line Interface), and it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) created with JavaFX.

While it was targeted at regular CLI users, after preliminary user experience feedback from the target audience, we noted that even experienced users require documentation to get familiar with commands. Also, they found it inconvenient to refer to the User Guide often.

It was our priority to improve their learning experience. So I took the initiative to go the extra mile to improve their command line experience.

Under the hood, it required major restructuring of input handling. In that process, I took care of that code was well abstracted for co-developers and future developers.

*AutoComplete with Dynamic Command Parsers*

* Benefits Users

** _What it does:_ allows users to be visually cued on the commands available that updates as he types.

** _Justification:_ It alleviates the drawback of being clueless and disoriented in a new command line interface

** _Highlights:_ The parser logic for autocomplete was designed from the ground up to cater for the application's unique needs.  After in-depth analysis of alternatives, the advanced paradigm of java reflections was utilised.

NOTE: In-depth explanation in User Guide extract below

* Benefits Developers

** _What it does:_ Allows new commands and parsers to be added with just one line of code

** _Justification:_ Abides open close principle of object oriented programming paradigm.

** _Highlights:_ Internal architecture was made succinct without unnecessary complications.

*Project management*

*** Coordinated development branch and master branch workflow for rapid prototyping in early weeks.

*** Suggested branching workflow (with username, merge count and purpose) during period closer to deployment for stability and accountability in changes.

*** Initial setup of continuous integration pipeline with Travis.

*** Managed product release on GitHub https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-2/main/releases/tag/v1.3.5[v1.3.5]


*** Actively participated in weekly team meetings that focused on restructuring of code base and to get everyone on the same page.
