    "description": "This module provides participants with in\u2010depth knowledge on the role of constituent materials of concrete such as cements, mineral admixtures, and chemical admixtures and their interactions that affect properties of fresh and hardened concrete. It also provides participants with in\u2010depth knowledge on concrete response to stresses, time\u2010dependent deformations, and durability of concrete exposed to severe environments. The module discusses the basic considerations and design philosophy for performance\u2010based design of concrete mixtures and production of concrete. It also discusses the progress in concrete technology and the latest development on high\u2010strength, highperformance, lightweight, and self\u2010compacting concrete. Sustainable development in construction industry and use of recycled aggregates and other recycled materials will be discussed as well. The module is targeted at practicing engineers.",
