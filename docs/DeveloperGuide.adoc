== Preface

This is the Developer Guide to Jarvis, a productivity manager tool designed
for NUS students who want to consolidate their schedule, tasks, finances and
modules in one place. The link to the GitHub repository can
be found link:{repourl}[here].

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture: High-Level View

The architecture diagram below explains the high-level design of Jarvis.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

`Main` has three classes called
link:{repourl}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/Main.java[`Main`],
link:{repourl}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/MainApp.java[`MainApp`], and
link:{repourl}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/AppParameters.java[`AppParameters`]

They are responsible for:

. On launch of Jarvis
+
Initialises all components (`Ui`, `Logic`, `Storage`, etc) in the correct
sequence and establishes the relevant links between each component.

. On exit of Jarvis
+
Shuts down all components and invokes any clean-up methods where necessary.

The rest of Jarvis consists of another four components:

[width="100%", cols="1, 3"]
|===
| Component                     | Remarks

|<<Design-Ui, *`UI`*>>          | Handles all UI logic in the application
|<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>     | Handles all parsing and execution of commands
'                                 that operates on `Model`.
|<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>     | Handles all reading and updating of runtime
                                  data within Jarvis.
|<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> | Handles all reading and writing of Jarvis'
                                  data, from and to the hard-disk.
|===

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as its corresponding
  component.

* Exposes its functionality using a `{ComponentName}Manager` concrete class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API using an interface `Logic`.
`Logic` is then implemented by the `LogicManager` concrete class, which
exposes its functionality to the rest of the application.

[[Design-ArchitectureInteraction]]
==== Architecture: Interactions between Components

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each
other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-cca 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete-cca 1` command
image::JarvisArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[1000,800]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The UI component defines the user-viewable part of the application. It consists
of a `MainWindow` made up of parts, such as the `StatusBarFooter`, `CommandBox`
and `HelpWindow`. Each individual feature of Jarvis inherits from the `View` class, which in turn inherits from the
abstract class `UiPart`. Every other non-feature related part inherits from the abstract class `UiPart`. Shown
below is the structure of the UI component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The `Ui` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of every part
is defined in matching `.fxml` files found in `/src/main/resources/view`.
For example, the layout of
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The UI has the following functionality:

* Takes in user input from the GUI, and using it in tandem with `Logic` to
  create the relevant commands.
* Executes the constructed commands using `Logic`.
* Listens for changes to `Model` so that the UI can be updated with the
  modified data.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/ui/[[Package\]]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component is the "brains" of Jarvis. While the `Ui` defines
the GUI and `Model` defines in-memory data, the `Logic` component does most
of the heavy-lifting in terms of deciding what to change within the `Model`
and what to return to the `Ui`. The diagram below shows the structure of the
`Logic` component.

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how the `Logic` component interacts with its internal
parts.

. Once a user input is obtained from the GUI, `Logic` uses `JarvisParser` to
  parse to command to return a `Command` object.
. The `Command` is executed by `LogicManager`.
. Depending on the command created, it may mutate the `Model`, such as adding
  a new task or course.
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` that
  is returned to `Ui`.
. These `CommandResults` can instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions,
  such as switching tabs between the various views, and displaying help or
  error messages to the user.

Shown below is the Sequence Diagram within the `Logic` component for the API
call: `execute("add-course c/CS1010")`.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add-course c/CS1010` Command
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

The original caller to `LogicManager`, in the context of Jarvis, is the `Ui`
component.

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/logic/[[Package\]]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` API is responsible for interacting with the data in Jarvis
including the various aspects such as user's preferences, command history,
finance management, cca information, courses and schedule information. The
`Model` API also acts as a facade that handles interaction with the data of
Jarvis.

Below is a class diagram involving the `Model` interface, which inherits
from the feature specific model interfaces.

.Model Interface
image::ModelInterfaceClassDiagram.png[]

The `Model` component,

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the `HistoryManager` data
* Stores the `FinanceTracker` data
* Stores the `CcaTracker` Data
* Stores the `CoursePlanner` Data
* Stores the `Planner` data

The concrete class `ModelManager` implements `Model` and manages the data
for Jarvis. `ModelManager` contains `UserPrefs`, `HistoryManager`, `CcaTracker`,
`CoursePlanner`, `FinanceTracker` and `Planner`. These classes manages the
data related to their specific features.

Below is a class diagram for `ModelManager`.

.`ModelManager` class
image::UpdatedModelClassDiagram.png[700,700]

Each feature has a class managing the data related to that feature as mentioned
earlier.

Below are the class diagrams of these classes.

.`UserPrefs`

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/model/[[Package\]]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` API is responsible for reading and writing data in json format.
This allows the application is remember information in json format when the
user closes the application. The `Storage` API acts as a facade that handles
interaction regarding storage related components.

Below is a class diagram involving the `Storage` interface, which
inherits from feature specific storage interfaces.

.Storage Interface
image::StorageInterfaceClassDiagram.png[]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `HistoryManager`, `FinanceTracker`, `CcaTracker`,
`CoursePlanner` and `Planner` data in json format and read it back.

The concrete class `StorageManager` implements `Storage` and manages
the storage for `UserPrefs`, `FinanceTracker`, `CcaTracker`,
`CoursePlanner`, `Planner` and `HistoryManager`.

Below is a class diagram of `StorageManager`.

.`StorageManager` class
image::UpdatedStorageClassDiagram.png[]

Each feature of Jarvis is able to save its information to local storage
in `JSON` format, by adapting each feature component into
`JsonSerializable{Component Name}` class.

Below are the class diagrams for these adapted classes.

.`JsonSerializableHistoryManager`
image::HistoryManagerStorageClassDiagram.png[200,200]

.`JsonSerializableCcaTracker`

link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/storage/[[Package\]]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Commons Component

The `commons` package represents a set of common classes and utilities used by
the multiple components throughout Jarvis.

Some examples are:

* link:{repourl}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/commons/util/JsonUtil.java[`JsonUtil`]
+
A class for formatting, reading and writing of `.json` files, heavily used by
the <<Design-Storage, `Storage`>> component.

* link:{repourl}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/commons/core/Messages.java[`Messages`]
+
A class that stores generic messages (i.e not specific to a particular feature)
to be displayed to the user throughout the application.

* link:{repourl}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/commons/core/LogsCenter.java/[`LogsCenter`]
+
A class used by many classes for writing and displaying log messages in Jarvis
log file.

Links : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jarvis/commons/[[Package\]]

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are
implemented.

=== Planner Feature

==== Overview

The planner feature in Jarvis enables users to easily organise and manage
their different tasks in school. Users will be able to keep track of tasks
they have done, tasks they have yet to do, and sort these tasks by
different attributes like task type and priority levels.

There are three types of tasks in the planner:

* `Todo`: Tasks with a description only
* `Event`: Tasks with a start and end date
* `Deadline`: Tasks with a due date

Users can `Tag` these tasks to sort them into different categories, as well
as add `Priority` and `Frequency` levels to them.

==== Implementation

The `Planner` contains a `TaskList`, which in turn, contains a number of tasks
a user has. Each task has a `TaskType` and `Status` and may also have a `Priority` level,
`Frequency` level and any number of `Tag` objects.

A simple outline of the `Planner` can be seen below, in Figure 26.

.Overview of the entire Planner
image::ModelPlannerClassDiagram.png[align=left]


The `Model` in Jarvis extends `PlannerModel` which facilitates all operations
necessary to carry out commands by the user.

* `Model#getPlanner()` -- Returns an instance of a `Planner`.

* `Model#addTask(int zeroBasedIndex, Task task` -- Adds a `Task` to the
planner at the specified `Index`.

* `Model#addTask(Task t)` -- Adds a `Task` to the `Planner`. Since no `Index`
is specified, the `Task` is appended to the end of the `TaskList`.

* `Model#deleteTask(Index index)` -- Deletes the `Task` at the specified
  `Index` from the `Planner`.

* `Model#deleteTask(Task t)` -- Deletes the specified `Task` from the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#size()` -- Returns the total number of `Task` objects in the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#hasTask(Task t)` -- Checks if a given `Task` is already in the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#markTaskAsDone(Index i)` - Changes the `Status` of a `Task` at the given
`Index` from `DONE` to `NOT_DONE`

* `Model#getTasks()` -- Returns the `TaskList` in the `Planner`.

* `Model#getTask(Index index)` - Retrieves the `Task` at the specified `Index` of
the `TaskList`

* `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` - Updates the `FilteredList` in the
`Planner` according to the given `Predicate`.

* `Model#updateSchedule()` - Updates the `FilteredList` of `Task` objects whose dates coincide with
the current date.

* `Model#getUnfilteredTaskList()` - Returns an `ObservableList<Task>` of all the `Task` objects
in the `Planner`.

* `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` - Returns an `ObservableList<Task>` of all the `Task` objects in
the `FilteredList`.

* `Model#getTasksToday()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of the list of `Task` objects that coincide with
the current day, backed by the `FilteredList` of `Planner`

* `Model#getTasksThisWeek()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of the list of `Task` objects that coincide with
the current week, backed by the `FilteredList` of `Planner`.

One example of the interaction between the `Model` and commands for the `Planner` can be seen when the user
executes a `pull-task` command.

.Sequence Diagram for pull-task command
image::PullTaskSequenceDiagram.png[align=left]

{sp} +

In the figure above, `pull-task` will result in the filtered lists in the `Planner` to be updated according to
the appropriate predicates. In this case, the predicate called will be `TaskPredicateMatchesPredicate` as the
user had specified a `pull-task` according to the `Priority` levels of the `Task` objects.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Task Descriptions in a Task

* **Option 1:** As a string attribute in `Task`

** Pros: Intuitive, easy to implement, less code required

** Cons: Provides a lower level of abstraction, especially if an `edit-task`
command is implemented

* **Option 2:** Building a separate `TaskDescription` class

** Pros: Higher level of abstraction

** Cons: More code, will take time to replace current methods that deal with
String `TaskDes` directly

Ultimately, we decided on Option 1 as there are no limitations on what a description of
a `Task` should be (other than not _null_). Further more, there is no manipulation of the
Task Description at the current stage of Jarvis, hence there is no real need to provide an
additional layer of abstraction for it. If we do intend to continue developing Jarvis in
the future, however, Option 2 might be a viable choice.

=== Finance Tracker Feature

==== Overview
The Finance Tracker feature allows the user to track their

1. Purchases
2. Monthly subscriptions (aka Installments)
3. Total & remaining spending

The feature offers the user to view his purchases and installments in two
separate lists, as well as be able to add, delete, find, edit these items.
Furthermore, the feature keeps track of the overall spending by the user
for the month, and if the user has set a limit, the feature tracks their
remaining available spending.

==== The Finance Tracker Model

The `FinanceTracker` class within the model provides an interface between the
components of the feature and the updating of the overall model. Like other
features, `Model` is associated with the finance tracker feature by
implementing `FinanceTrackerModel`, from which `Model` implements.

Some of the more significant methods within the `FinanceTracker` are shown
below:

* `Model#addPurchase(Purchase)` - Adds a single use payment to the top of the
list

* `Model#deletePurchase(Index)` - Deletes single use payment at that index

* `Model#addInstallment(Installment)` - Adds an installment

* `Model#deleteInstallment(Index)` - Deletes installment at that index

* `Model#hasSimilarInstallment(Installment)` - Checks for the existence of an
    installment with the same description in the finance tracker

* `Model#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` - Replaces an existing
    installment with a new installment

* `Model#calculateTotalSpending()` - Calculates the total expenditure by the
    user for this month

* `Model#calculateRemainingAmount()` - Calculates the remaining spending amount
    available to user

The Finance Tracker feature closely follows the extendable OOP solution already
implemented within AB3. In the Finance Tracker, the `Installment` objects and
the `Purchase` objects manage most aspects related to this feature. These
objects are stored in their respective `ObservableList` - `InstallmentList`
and `PurchaseList`, which provide an abstraction with `add`, `delete`, and
`set` operations that are called by `FinanceTracker` and its model.

Shown below is the class diagram for the Finance Tracker.

.Finance Tracker Class Diagram
image::ModelFinanceTrackerClassDiagram.png[]

==== Finance Tracker Components

As mentioned above, the Finance Tracker contains `Installment` and `Purchase`
objects.

===== Installments

Installments are monthly subscriptions added by the user to the Finance
Tracker and are stored in an `InstallmentList`. The current codebase requires
that all installments **must** have the following *non-nullable* attributes:

* `InstallmentDescription`
* `InstallmentMoneyPaid`

===== Purchases
Purchases are single use payments added by the user to the Finance Tracker
and are stored in a `PurchaseList`. The current codebase requires that all
purchases **must** have the following *non-nullable* attributes:

* `PurchaseDescription`
* `PurchaseMoneySpent`

==== Feature Details

The application should be able to add and delete both types of objects.
Furthermore, it should be able to find specific purchases and allow editing of
installments by their index in the `InstallmentList`.

We will be focusing on the editing of installments.

===== Editing an installment

The user has to specify the index of the installment he wishes
to edit, as well as any of the fields he wishes to change. If the index does
not exist, the system will inform the user of the error. As long as the
fields provided by the user to be edited are valid (prefixed with "d/" and
"a/"), the correct installment will be accurately edited. This is
reflected in the Activity Diagram below.

NOTE: An index is considered invalid if the numerical value provided is less
than or equal to zero, or greater than the largest index in `InstallmentList`.

.Activity Diagram for edit-install command
image::EditInstallmentActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Command Execution

For brevity's sake, we will illustrate only 2 specific commands and its
executions on model. These two commands are the `edit-install` and the
`delete-paid` commands.

===== Command `edit-install`

The following sequence diagram illustrates how an
`Installment` is edited when a user types in a `edit-install` command:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The
`FinanceTracker` is initialized. Assume that a valid `Installment` has already
been added to the `InstallmentList` in `FinanceTracker`.

Step 2. The user executes
`edit-install 1 d/student-price Spotify subscription a/7.50`
command to edit both the description and money spent on the existing
Installment in the FinanceTracker. An `EditInstallmentCommandParser` object is
created and its `#parse` method is called. The parse method returns a new
`EditInstallmentCommand` object.

Step 3. The `EditInstallmentCommand` object is executed on the model. The
`EditInstallmentCommand#execute` method is called, and this will create a new
`Installment` object from the existing installment but with all the edited
fields changed. In this method,
`Model#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` method is called.

[NOTE]
The `EditInstallmentCommand#execute` method first checks for whether the
index is within the size of InstallmentList.

Step 4. As mentioned in section 2, the methods in `Model` merely mirrors the
methods in the `FinanceTracker` class. As such, the
`FinanceTracker#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` method is called.
This in turns calls the
`#InstallmentList#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` method.

Step 5. This `InstallmentList#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)`
method first finds the `Installment` based on its corresponding index. Then,
it sets the edited installment at the index found earlier.

[NOTE]
TLDR: The calling of the `#setInstallment` method at the `Model`
level triggers a cascading series of `#setInstallment` method which culminates
in target installment being edited with the corresponding fields.

.Sequence Diagram for edit-install command
image::EditInstallmentSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Command `delete-paid`

The following sequence diagram illustrates how a
`Purchase` is deleted when a user types in a `delete-paid` command:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The
`FinanceTracker` is initialized. Assume that a valid `Purchase` has already
been added to the `PurchaseList` in `FinanceTracker`.

Step 2. The user executes `delete-paid 1` command to delete an existing
Purchase in the FinanceTracker. An `RemovePaidCommandParser` object is
created and its `#parse` method is called. The parse method returns a new
`RemovePaidCommand` object.

Step 3. The `RemovePaidCommand` object is executed on the model. The
`RemovePaidCommand#execute` method is called. In this method,
`Model#deletePurchase(Index)` method is called.

[NOTE]
The `RemovePaidCommand#execute` method first checks for whether the
index is within the size of PurchaseList.

Step 4. As mentioned in section 2, the methods in `Model` merely mirrors the
methods in the `FinanceTracker` class. As such, the
`FinanceTracker#deletePurchase(Index)` method is called.
This in turns calls the`#PurchaseList#deletePurchase(Index)` method.

Step 5. This `PurchaseList#deletePurchase(Index)` method will then delete
the corresponding purchase at the given index.

.Sequence Diagram for delete-paid command
image::DeletePurchaseSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

There were several design choices that we had to consider for the
implementation of the Finance Tracker feature.

===== Encapsulation of fields for `Installment` and `Purchase` objects.

Given that the `Installment` objects and the `Purchase` objects manage most
aspects related to the Finance Tracker feature, we had to consider how to
properly build the objects and the fields within them. This was a decision
that was made after much thinking as we had already begun implementing the
skeleton of the feature.

Below are our considerations in refactoring the implementation at that point
in time:

* **Option 1: Encapsulate constituent objects in their own wrapper classes**
+
As mentioned above, `Installment` would contain `InstallmentDescription` and `InstallmentMoneyPaid`
objects while `Purchase` would contain `PurchaseDescription` and
`PurchaseMoneySpent` objects.
+
This would increase OOP, which would provide a clearer modular structure to
hide implementation details. Furthermore, this would also allow the objects to
be re-used as they are more extensible, which is something we had to consider
for subsequent features.
+
In further development of our application, increasing OOP would also allow
developers to maintain the application more easily and hopefully aid in
quicker development since the code is easier to read and maintain.
+
However, as we had already begun implementing some basic methods, making
this decision resulted in a steep increase in code as everything had to
abstracted into separate classes.

* **Option 2: Using primitive data types**
+
On one hand, our team thought that since the `Installment` and `Purchase`
objects were not extremely complex, we could go without further encapsulation.
Furthermore, this would have been the easier alternative at the time
as it was the original implementation.
+
However, we decided that in the long-term vision of the application to
continue to be developed, we should increase OOP as much as possible.

===== Our Thoughts

In general, our decision was based primarily on following good software
engineering principles and providing the ability to allow for better
understanding and maintenance of our code base in the future. Thus,
we went with the first option.

=== CcaTracker Feature

==== Overview
The application is able to track Ccas. Each user can have multiple Ccas and
each Cca can have multiple equipments needed. In addition, the application is
able to track the progress of each person in their Ccas. Hence, there is a
need to represent the CcaTracker as a list of Ccas on which the application
can perform create, read, update and delete operations on each Cca.

==== The CcaTracker Model

The `CcaTracker` class within the model provides an interface between the
components of the feature and the updating of the overall model. Like other
features, `Model` is associated with the cca tracker feature by
implementing `CcaTrackerModel`, from which `Model` implements.

Some of the more significant methods within the `CcaTracker` are shown
below:

* `Model#containsCca(Cca cca)` -- Checks if the `CcaTracker` contains the
given cca.

* `Model#addCca(Cca cca)` -- Adds a `Cca` to the `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#removeCca(Cca cca)` -- Removes a `Cca` from the `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#updateCca(Cca toBeUpdatedCca, Cca updatedCca)` -- Updates a `Cca` in
the `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#getCcaTracker()` -- Gets the `CcaTracker` instance.

* `Model#getNumberOfCcas()` -- Returns the number of `Ccas` currently in the
  `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#getCca(Index index)` -- Gets the `Cca` instance by its index in the
  `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#updateFilteredCcaList(Predicate<Cca> predicate)` -- Updates the
  `FilteredCcaList` by passing it a predicate.

* `Model#getFilteredCcaList()` -- Returns an instance of the `FilteredCcaList`

* `Model#addProgress(Cca targetCca, CcaProgressList toAddCcaProgressList)` -
Adds `CcaProgressList` to the target `Cca`.

* `Model#increaseProgress(Index index)` -- Increases the progress of the `Cca`



==== Cca Tracker components
The class diagram for CcaTrackerModel is shown below:

.CcaTracker Class Diagram
image::ModelCcaTrackerClassDiagram.png[]

As seen in the diagram above, The `CcaTracker` consists primarily of a single `CcaList` object. This `CcaList` object is
essentially a wrapper around an `ObservableList` of `Cca` objects. Do note that the `CcaList` object can contain any
number of `Cca` objects (including none).

More interestingly, each `Cca` is made up of the following components, all of which are **non-nullable** attributes:

===== CcaName
Each `CcaName` is essentially just a wrapper class around a string that is the `Cca` 's name.

===== CcaType
Each `CcaType` is also just a wrapper class around a string that is the `Cca` 's type. Note that each `CcaType` is
restricted to 1 of the 4 enum types:

* sport
* performingArt
* uniformedGroup
* club

===== EquipmentList
Each `EquipmentList` is implemented as an `ObservableList` of `Equipment` objects. Note that each `EquipmentList` can
contain any number of `Equipment` objects (including none).

===== CcaProgress
The `CcaProgress` is a little more noteworthy. Each `CcaProgress` object contains a `CcaMilestoneList` object and a
`CcaCurrentProgress` object. As with all the lists in the `CcaTracker` feature, the `CcaMilestoneList` object is
implemented using an `ObservableList` as well. The `CcaCurrentProgress` class is merely a wrapper around an integer that
tracks the exact `CcaMilestone` that the user is currently at.


Now that we have an understanding of the underlying implementation of `CcaTracker`, lets take a closer look at the
feature details.

==== Feature details

CcaTracker has 7 specific commands that support the given operations to mutate
the state of the `Model`. Each command is represented as seperate class:

* `AddCcaCommand` -- Adds a `Cca` to the `CcaTracker`.

* `DeleteCcaCommand` -- Deletes a `Cca` from the `CcaTracker`.

* `EditCcaCommand` -- Edits the selected `Cca` in the `CcaTracker`.

* `FindCcaCommand` -- Finds a `Cca` from the `CcaTracker` based on the
  keywords specified .

* `ListCcaCommand` -- Lists all the `Cca` from the `CcaTracker`.

* `AddProgressCommand` -- Adds a progress tracker to a cca.

* `IncreaseProgressCommand` -- Increments the progress level of a cca.

For brevity's sake, we will illustrate only 1 specific command and its
execution on model.

The following activity diagram illustrates how a `Cca` 's
progress is incremented when a user types in an `increase-progress` command:

===== Increasing a cca's progress

.Activity Diagram for increase-progress command
image::ccatracker/IncreaseCcaProgressActivityDiagram.png[]

Firstly, before any increasing of progress can take place, the user has to add a `Cca` to the `CcaTracker` through the
`add-cca` command. The user then has to add a `CcaMilestoneList` to the `CcaTracker` through the `add-progress` command.

[NOTE]
Note that the execution of each command as stated above branches off into different scenarios, all of which present
themselves to the user in form of prompts in the user interface.

==== Command Execution
The diagram below shows the sequence diagram of the increase-progress mechanism.
Note that some classnames and methods had to be split into multiple lines due
to image size constraints.

image::ccatracker/IncreaseProgressSequenceDiagram.png[]


Given below is an example usage scenario of how the increase-progress mechanism
behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CcaTracker`
is initialized. Assume that a `Cca` has already been added to the Cca and that
a progress tracker has already been set for that `Cca`.

Step 2. The user executes `increase-progress 1` command to increment the
progress of the 1st `Cca` in the CcaTracker. A `IncreaseProgressCommandParser`
object is created and its `#parse` method is called. The parse method returns
a new `IncreaseProgressCommand` object.

Step 3. The `IncreaseProgressCommand` object is then executed on model. The
`IncreaseProgressCommand#execute` method is called and in this method, the
`Model#increaseProgress` method is called.

[NOTE]
The `IncreaseProgressCommand#execute` method first checks for whether the
index is within the size of CcaList.

Step 4. As mentioned in section 2, the methods in `Model` merely mirrors the
methods in the `CcaTracker` class. As such, the `CcaTracker#increaseProgress`
method is called. This in turn calls the `CcaList#increaseProgress` method.
This method first finds the `Cca` based on its corresponding index. Then, it
calls the `Cca#increaseProgress` method.

Step 5. This in turn calls the `CcaProgress#increaseProgress` method that
calls `CcaCurrentProgress#increaseProgress` method. At long last, the final
`#increaseProgress` method in the `CcaCurrentProgress` instance is called and
the `currentProgress` counter is incremented by 1.

[NOTE]
In short, the calling of the `#increaseProgress` method at the `CcaTracker` level
triggers a cascading series of `#increaseProgress` methods which culminates in
the `currentProgress` variable being incremented by 1.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Whether to have subclasses for each type of cca.

* *Option 1: Instantiate a `CcaProgress` object for
  each `Cca`*
This entails implementing `CcaProgess` class as consisting of a `CcaMilestoneList` and a `CcaCurrentProgess`. The

** Pros: Less code needed.
** Cons: Less extensible as CcaProgress is now limited to what is essentially a list of strings.

* *Option 2: Implement `CcaProgress` as a parent class.*
This entails creating classes such as SportProgress/PerformingArtsProgress that extend from CcaProgress for each type
of `Cca`.

** Pros: Easier to extend functionality for each type of cca.
** Cons: Does not significantly extend functionality for this version of
Jarvis.
+
Such an implementation can be represented using the class diagram below

.Class diagram showing the alternative implementation of CcaProgress.
image::ccatracker/AlternativeCcaProgressClassDiagram.png[]

===== Our Thoughts
After much consideration, we have decided to implement `CcaProgress` as per option 1. This is because we wish to afford
the user the flexibility to set whichever milestones they wish to in their Cca.

Option 2 would entail hardcoding a certain type of `CcaMilestone` for each type of `CcaProgress`. For example,
each `UniformedGroupProgress` might have included a series of `CcaMilestoneRanks`, where the user can set each
CcaMilestoneRanks to be ranks such as Private, Lance Corporal, Corporal, Sergeant etc. Then, the
`UniformedGroupProgress` could have individualised attributes such as types of awards etc.

However, in light of the fact that Jarvis is a CLI application, it would have been extremely cumbersome for the user to
type the myriad number of options.

===== Aspect: Whether to use observable list for `CcaProgressList`

* *Option 1 : Implement CcaProgressList as an
  `ObservableList`*
** Pros: Easier to manipulate for JavaFx.
** Cons: Potentially complicated nesting when passing arguments to it as
   CcaProgressList is nested several classes within `Cca`.

* *Option 2: Implement CcaProgressList as a normal `List` e.g.
  `ArrayList`.*
** Pros: Does not require predicates to be passed in.
** Cons: Might be more complicated when rendering in Javafx.

===== Our Thoughts
Implementing the `CcaProgressList` as an `ArrayList` would have been an easier option. However, the implementation of
the `CcaProgressList` as an `ObservableList` proved to be a wiser choice as `Javafx` fully supports the manipulation and
rendering of an `ObservableList`. Using an `ArrayList`  would have made the building of the ui thoroughly cumbersome.

=== Course Planner Feature

==== Overview
The Course Planner feature allows the user to track what courses they

1. Have taken
2. Are taking, and
3. Want to take

The feature offers updated information on courses offered by NUS, along with
convenient add, delete and check operations on the user's course list.

==== The Course Planner Model

The `CoursePlanner` class within the model provides an interface between the
components of the feature and the updating of the overall model. Like other
features, `Model` is associated with the course planner feature via
implementing `CoursePlannerModel`, from which `Model` implements.

Some of the more interesting methods (i.e not simple accessor and mutator
methods) within `CoursePlanner` are shown below:

* `Model#addCourse(Course)` - Adds a course to the user's list
* `Model#deleteCourse(Course)` - Deletes the course from the user's list
* `Model#lookUpCourse(Course)` - Looks up information about the given course
* `Model#checkCourse(Course)` - Checks if the user can take this course
* `Model#hasCourse(Course)` - Checks if the given course exists in the user's
list

The list of courses of the user is stored internally using a `UniqueCourseList`
object, providing an abstraction with `add` and `delete` operations that
are called by `CoursePlanner` and its model.

The text that is displayed to the user within the UI showing information about
the Course Planner is abstracted within the course text display. This is a
simple class that uses `Observable` to track changes to it as the program runs.
The class abstracts some operations on this string such as setting, getting,
printing to a displayable form, etc.

Shown below is the Class diagram for the Course Planner.

.Course Model Class Diagram
image::ModelCoursePlannerClassDiagram.png[]

Every `Course` has a few non-nullable attributes - `Title`, `CourseCode`,
`CourseCredit`, `Faculty` and `Description`. The other three (`PrereqTree`,
`Preclusion` and `FulfillRequirements`) are not required to exist as it
depends on the course's data.

==== Design Considerations

As explained above, the `CoursePlanner` is implemented by `Model` and follows
much of the extendable OOP solution implemented within Jarvis that is common
to the other features.

This section will discuss about the individual components that were created
for this feature, the alternative Software Engineering design choices for each
one, and our thought process of the eventual choices made for each component.

===== Course Datasets

Course datasets are taken directly from the {nus-mods-api}[NUSMods API]. These
datasets are stored using the `.json` file format on NUSMod's API. Since
Jarvis already heavily uses the Jackson JSON API, we have opted to store all
course data within Jarvis in their original form. Therefore, all data is read
directly from `.json` files.

[NOTE]
NUSMods is a popular website officially affiliated with NUS, where
students are able to look up information about courses and plan their school
timetable. This makes its dataset a reliable source of course information.

Each course, and their data, are given its own file. These files are laid out
in `/modinfo` within `/resources` to be easily accessible by the program.

A sample, valid `AB1234.json` is given below for a fictional course `AB1234`.

[JSON]
----
{
    "courseCode": "AB1234",
    "courseCredit": "4",
    "description": "Course description for AB1234.",
    "faculty": "A Faculty in NUS",
    "fulfillRequirements": [ "AB2234" ],
    "preclusion": "AB1231, AB1232",
    "prereqTree": {
        "and": [
            {
                "or": [
                    "CD1111",
                    "XY2222"
                ]
            },
            "EF3333"
        ]
    },
    "title": "Course AB1234's title"
}
----

As explained above, certain attributes of a `Course` are non-nullable. This
choice was made due to the actual course datasets -

This also means that every semester, all datasets must be pre-processed before
being deployed into the application. It is quite simple to create a script to do
the pre-processing, and is such a good trade-off as opposed to manually
checking every field when pulling data from a course file.

====== Storing of Course Datasets

A decision we had to make concerned the way we would store the data to be
referenced on runtime. Considering the multiple options, two stood out as
being the most feasible within Jarvis.

* **Option 1: Storing every course in a single, large JSON file**
+
This makes file handling easier to manage. Every course can be found in single
file and the code need not deal with many `FileNotFoundException` or
`IOException` upon lookup, as the file is guaranteed to exist.
+
The trade-off is that a large file will be difficult to view for a developer.
It will also have slow performance as the entire file would have to be
processed to look up one course.
+
The developer may also:
+
.. Store the whole file in a buffer for faster lookup, but this may be
time-consuming and troublesome to implement, especially due to the memory
consumption, or:
+
.. Process the whole file and create all `Course` objects upon start-up.
However, due to the large number of course files (11000+), this may also
have significant memory overhead.

* **Option 2: Storing each course as its own file**
+
This allows for fast lookup as the contents of all 11000+ course files of data
do not need to be scanned directly. Fast string concatenation of file paths
directly to the relevant `.json` file can be used instead.
+
Unfortunately, this also makes the data-set difficult to manage. If we want
to modify the data-set in any way, a script will have to be written to process
every file in the data-set. Additionally, every lookup must deal with
file-related exceptions.

====== Our Thoughts

We decided to go with Option 2, as once the files were downloaded and
processed, there was no need to modify them any further. Processing, or loading
inside a buffer, of very large text files are likely to significantly hamper
performance for little benefit. Manual lookup information about a specific
course during development is also much easier with such a method.


===== And-Or Tree

The `AndOrTree<R>` is a tree data structure served by the `util/andor` package
that provides an abstraction for processing the prerequisite tree.  The
prerequisite tree (henceforth referred to as `prereqTree`) is an attribute of a
`Course` that is available in the NUSMod's course data-set, the data comes in
the form of a `String` and will be covered shortly.

Before covering the tree itself, it would be helpful to cover its building
blocks.

====== The `AndOrNode` Class

Each node in the tree of type `R` is represented by an `AndOrNode<R>`. Every
node has a `List<AndOrNode<R>>`, to be used in checking the truth condition
of the tree, and every node is either an `AndNode`, `OrNode` or `DataNode`
node. This determines the conditional used to check the truth condition of a
node.

The truth condition of a node is determined using the method:
`boolean fulfills(Collection<R>)`. This checks the truth condition of the node
based on the following predicates:

1. The node is an `AndNode`
+
Any subset of elements in `Collection<R>` must match all children of this
node.

2. The node is an `OrNode`
+
Any element in `Collection<R>` must match at least one of the children of this
node.

3. The node is a `DataNode`
+
Any element in `Collection<R>` must match the data stored in this node.

So, an `AndNode<String>` with children `{"1", "2", "3"}` will match `true`
against a collection of `{"1", "2", "3", "4"}` and `false` against a collection
of `{"2", "3"}`.

====== Node Creation

The following class diagram demonstrates the structure of the `abstract class`
`AndOrNode` and its sub-classes.

.AndOrNode Inheritance Diagram
image::ryanytan-AndOrNodeInheritanceClassDiagram.png[800,600]

Using this format, a static method of the form `AndOrNode#createNode(T,String)`
is able to construct all instances of its sub-class, thus the caller will not
need to know of the different type of nodes.

====== The `AndOrTree` Class

The following are `public` methods in `AndOrTree`.

* `buildTree(String, Function<String, ? extends R>)`
+
Builds a tree from the given jsonString. `Function` is a mapper that processes
a `String` and returns a value of type `R`, where `R` is the type of data
stored by each node in the tree.

* `fulfills(Collection<R>)`
+
Checks if the given `Collection` of type `R` fulfills the condition specified
by this tree. `AndOrNode` has its own corresponding `fulfill` that checks its
children or data against `Collection`.

Due to the arbitrary ordering of the tree, `insert()` and `delete()` operations
commonly found in implementations of ordered trees are difficult to implement.
Instead, the tree is fully created upon the call to `buildTree()` and is then
enforced to be immutable once built. This is reflected in the class' lack of
mutator methods.


====== Building of the `AndOrTree`

As mentioned above, we use the `prereqTree` attribute in order to build the
tree. An example of a processable json string is as such:

----
"prereqTree": {
    "and": [
        {
            "or": [
                "CD1111",
                "XY2222"
            ]
        },
        "EF3333"
    ]
}
----

This can be read as:

----
To take AB1234, you require...
 |
 └ all of
   ├── one of
   |   ├─ "CD1111"
   |   └─ "XY2222"
   └─ "EF3333"
----

This means that to take the fictional course `AB1234`, a user would have to
complete `EF3333`, **and** either `CD1111` or `XY2222`.

The `buildTree()` method takes in the `json` string as an input. The Jackson
API uses this string to create a root `JsonNode` object, and the tree is built
recursively from the root. The sequence diagram of the tree building process is
shown below:

.buildTree() Sequence Diagram
image::ryanytan-AndOrSequenceDiagramSimplified.png[]

The class looks at each node - checks if its is an `Object`, `Array` or a
`String`, and does the appropriate actions and function calls.

Other ways of building the tree can be easily extended by overloading the
`buildTree` method. However, this will not override the immutable properties of
the tree.

====== Dependency on Course

`AndOrTree` posed some difficulty for us, in the decision to couple the
implementation of `AndOrTree` with `Course`. This is because the tree will
only ever be used by the Course Planner within the program, and thus it is
not required to implement the tree using generics. However, this would increase
coupling between `AndOrTree` and `Course`, which is unfavourable for testing.

Below are our considerations in implementing this data structure:

* **Option 1: Couple `AndOrTree` to `Course`**
+
This means that there is no need to pass any mapper function into the
`buildTree()` method as the class does not need to know how to map from `String`
to `R`. This also makes handling mapping exceptions easier as they can be
handled directly by `Course` instead of by `AndOrTree`.
+
However, this increases coupling between the tree and `Course`, resulting in
the correctness of the `AndOrTree` class being dependent on `Course` as there
is no way to stub it. The tree will also only be locked to `Course` and is
non-extendable.

* **Option 2: Using Generics**
+
This makes the tree reusable in the future. The tree will also
be able to store any data-type which allows for easier unit testing, since
it won't be dependent on the correctness of `Course`. Instead well-tested
libraries such as Java's `String` API can be used to test the class instead.
+
However, due to how the tree is built (i.e from a json string), a
mapper function must be passed into the `buildTree()` method to process
the string in each node to the generic type of the tree. The function is of
the type `Function<String, ? extends R>`, for a tree of type `R`.

====== Our Thoughts

Due to its benefits far outweighing its disadvantages, we picked the second
choice of using generics. While extendability and re-usability of the class is
a nice bonus, the decrease in coupling and increase in testability was the
deciding factor in choosing between these two approaches. Furthermore, behavior
of the building of the tree can be easily extended by either inheritance, or
overloading of the `buildTree()` method.

==== Implementation

With the significant individual components covered, the process of the
Course Planner can be discussed. We will be covering the `check` command
since the rest of the commands are either simple insert and delete operations
on a list, or retrieving data from a file. This command allows us to see the
full extent of back-end to front-end operations on the Course Planner.

The `check` operation allows users to check if they are able to take a certain
course. Whether the user can take the course depends on the courses in their
list. The following is the activity diagram of general overview of the process
when the user types a `check` command.

.Check Command Activity Diagram
image::ryanytan-CheckActivityDiagram.png[TODO]

Additionally, the following below shows the sequence diagram of how the
program checks if the user satisfies the course's prerequisites.

.CheckCommand Sequence Diagram
image::ryanytan-CheckCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The implementation in the back-end is quite similar to the other features, as
seen in the similarities between the above sequence diagram and the one
<<Design-ArchitectureInteraction, under the Architecture section>>.

=== Undo / Redo Feature

This section covers in detail the undo/redo feature of Jarvis.

We will cover these main points:

* Design Considerations
* Feature Details
* Implementations
* User Scenario demonstrating undo/redo

Let's explore how we decided to implement the undo/redo feature in the Design
Considerations section below.

==== Design Considerations
There were several available behavioral design patterns that we were
considering to adopt to implement our undo/redo feature in the application.

* Command Pattern
* Memento Pattern

These patterns are common useful patterns to enable undo/redo functions.
These are also viable options as our application design allows both of these
approaches to be integrated easily.

Let’s see how these adopting each of these approaches will span out in the
development of the application.

===== Command Pattern Approach

The application already makes use of the command pattern to decouple the
internal state of the application and the user action. Therefore implementing
undo/redo function with the command pattern would require us to achieve the
following things:

1.  Implement a class, `HistoryManager` to manage and store commands that
have been done/undone in chronological sequence to facilitate undo and redo
functions. This should be facilitated with the use of two `Deque`/`Stack`
like structures. One will be fore storing the commands that have been done,
while the other will be storing the commands that have been undone.
2. Implement ways to discern amongst commands that should be added to
`HistoryManager`, whereby undoable commands should be added, while
non-undoable commands should not be added.
3. Implement the inverse operation of commands that can be undone.
4. Integrate `HistoryManager` into `Model` by Implementing undo and redo
operations in `HistoryManager` to execute on the `Model` it is associated
with and expose these operations to the `Model`. An undo operation will
remove the latest done command and execute its inverse operation onto the
`Model` before it is added as the latest undone command. A redo operation
will remove the latest undone command and execute its normal execution on
the `Model` before it is added as the latest done command.
5. Implement commands, `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`, along with their
respective parsers, `UndoCommandParser` and `RedoCommandParser`.
6. Integrate commands and parsers into `JarvisParser`.
7. Integrate logic in `LogicManager` to add undoable commands to
`HistoryManager`.
8. Implement storage for `HistoryManager` by implementing a `JSON`
serializable `HistoryManager` along with the `JSON` adapted commands it
stores so it can be written to a `JSON` file in local storage.
9. Integrate the logic to save `HistoryManager` to local storage in
`LogicManager` after the successful execution of commands.

===== Characteristics
* Space efficient due to storing commands instead of states of the entire
application. Efficient usage of RAM and local storage for the application.
* Commands logic will be more complex as they must know how to undo its
execution. Commands contain more data to retain information needed to undo
its execution.
* Complex inverse executions may be unnecessarily convoluted compared other
approaches (such as the memento pattern). This involves more planning and
support on the classes that commands execute on.
* Requires implementation and testing of each command (and future commands)
to enable undo/redo function with respect to that command. Development of the
application will involve more overhead when integrating new commands to the
application as there are more behaviour to test.
* Development of `HistoryManager` scales along with commands that are added
to the application. Even after `HistoryManager` is developed and integrated
into the application, additional work is required with each command, such as
supporting inverse execution and serializing the command (for local storage).
This can affect development schedule and add time constraints when working
with tight deadlines.

===== Memento Pattern Approach

The application follows a structural facade pattern, storing the data in
`ModelManager` which implements the `Model`, which is an interface for
commands to interact with. `ModelManager` manages classes that wrap their
respective data. Therefore implementing undo/redo function with the command
pattern would require us to achieve the following things:

1. Implement a `Version` class. This class wraps the state of another class
as an immutable “snapshot”.
2. Define the interface `VersionedModel` that extends `Model` with additional
methods to save its current state and to change its state. `VersionedModel`
could be viewed as a _originator_ class that can produce “snapshots” of its
own state and update its state from “snapshots”. These “snapshots” are in
wrapped in the above `Version` class.
3. Let `ModelManager` implement `VersionedModel` along with its methods to
allow `ModelManager` to produce `Version` objects containing its current state
and to update `ModelManager` to a state provided by a given `Version`.
4. Implement a `HistoryManager` class to facilitate as a _caretaker_ class.
`HistoryManager` will store a series of `Version` objects containing states of
the `VersionedModel` in two `Deque`/`Stack` like structures. One will be to
store the previous versions, while the other is to store the future versions
that were undone from.
5. Implement commands, `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`, along with their
respective parsers, `UndoCommandParser` and `RedoCommandParser`.
6. Update commands to take in both `VersionedModel` and `HistoryManager`
as arguments in their execute methods so that undo/redo commands can get
`Version` objects containing previous or subsequent states of
`VersionedModel` from `HistoryManager` for `VersionedModel` to update to.
7. Integrate commands and parsers into `JarvisParser`.
8. Implement storage for `HistoryManager` by implementing a `JSON`
serializable `HistoryManager` along with the `JSON` adapted `Version` so
that it can be written to a `JSON` file in local storage.
9. Integrate the logic to save `HistoryManager` to local storage in
`LogicManager` after the successful executions of commands.

===== Characteristics
* Expensive on space due to storing multiple copies of the application
state. This increases the usage of RAM and local storage for the
application.
* Simple robust implementation that can be developed quickly, which can be
useful for tight schedules in the development process.
* Protects the encapsulation of private data of the application state
(provided local storage data is also encrypted). This prevents violation of
encapsulation of classes.
* Development of `HistoryManager` scales with how the information to be
remembered changes. Whenever the nature of the information to be remembered
changes, the memento class `Version` needs to be updated along with how
`VersionedModel` updates and saves its state. Adding new commands also do not
require any changed to `HistoryManager` unless there are changes to the data
fields to be saved in `Model`.

===== Our Thoughts
These are the following questions we asked ourselves when deciding between
these two approaches

* RAM and storage
* Development process
* Software design principles

===== RAM and storage

Since storing commands is more space efficient than storing states of the
`Model`, the command pattern will occupy less space than the memento pattern.

Being space efficient will allow us to increase the range of undo/redo
function of the application.

Considering the target user group being students, we also want to develop an
application that would not consume too much RAM or local storage given
students budgets and varying tiers of laptops.

Therefore regarding this aspect, we favor command pattern over the memento
pattern.

===== Development process

The memento pattern will require us to update `HistoryManager` whenever the
`Model` changes, while the command pattern will require us to implement
inverse executions for each additional command.

Therefore the memento pattern would require more overhead when changing the
`Model` of the application while the command pattern require more overhead
when adding undoable commands.

Our application are subject to both of these changes such as changes to the
`Model` and adding new commands. Therefore both patterns are similar in
overhead and depends on the frequency of changes made to `Model` or adding
new commands. We feel that both options are viable and would be feasible for
our team in the development of this application.

===== Software Design Principles

Both patterns would involve introducing dependency between `Model` and
`HistoryManager`.

The memento pattern would involve `HistoryManager` having a unidirectional
dependency to `VersionedModel` while introducing `HistoryManager` as a
dependency to `Command`.

The command pattern would involve `HistoryManager` having dependency with
`Model`. We can choose to nest `HistoryManager` into `Model` which would
increase coupling between the two classes by introducing bidirectional
dependency. We may choose to introduce this coupling to prevent increasing
the dependency between `Command` as command will just be associated with
`Model`.

Both patterns involve `HistoryManager` with the responsibility of keeping
track of commands/states. Single Responsibility Principle is not violated
in both approaches.

===== Design Choice

We determined that going along with the command pattern. We want to cater
this application to students whose laptops may not have generous amounts of
RAM. On top of the fact that students typically use their browsers
_extensively_, we felt that we should be mindful of RAM usage.

Comparisons between command pattern and memento pattern with respect to the
development process were trivial since the `Model` and command sets are
already planned, and future changes to `Model` and commands would not have
any serious drawback regardless of the approach.

The section below will discuss feature details and characteristics we have
considered that would influence the logic of how we implement undo/redo.

==== Feature Details

The application should be able to undo and redo changes made by commands to
give the user more flexibility in their inputs. Undo and redo operations
should also be undo or redo multiple commands in a command. In the event that
a undo/redo command that comprises of multiple undo/redo operations fails at
any point, all changes made by the command should be rolled back. This is
reflected in the Activity Diagrams below.

.Activity Diagram for undo command
image::UndoCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

.Activity Diagram for redo command
image::RedoCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

Therefore there is a need to remember commands that change the state of the
`Model`. Commands that just render a view without actually changing the
application should not be stored as it does not make sense to undo or redo
them. We will distinguish these types of commands into two categories,
*invertible commands* and *non-invertible commands*.

* *Invertible commands* -- commands that mutate the state of the `Model` and
should be stored for `undo`/`redo` functions.

* *Non-invertible commands* -- commands that do not mutate the state of the
  `Model` and should not be stored for `undo`/`redo` functions.

[NOTE]
Undo and redo commands will be considered non-invertible commands even though
they technically change the state of the `Model`. The reason is that they are
commands facilitating the undo and redo operation, thus they should not be
stored.

The following activity diagram illustrates how commands are remembered when a
user types in a command:

.Activity Diagram for how commands are remembered after their successful execution
image::InverseCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The section below will discuss in more detail how undo/redo is implemented.

==== Implementation
The undo/redo feature mechanism is facilitated by `HistoryManager`.
`HistoryManager` remembers *invertible commands*. These commands are stored
internally in two `CommandDeque` objects, `executedCommands` and
`inverselyExecutedCommands`. `CommandDeque` serve as custom `Deque` data
structure, which stores the latest added command to the top.

An undo operation would comprise of taking the latest executed command from
`executedCommands`, inversely executing it, and adding it to
`inverselyExecutedCommands`. A redo operation would comprise of a taking the
latest inversely executed command from `inverselyExecutedCommands`, executing
it, and adding it to `executedCommands`.

`Model` supports operations to facilitate undo and redo capabilities by
extending the `HistoryModel` which has the following operations:

* `Model#getHistoryManager()` -- Gets the `HistoryManager` instance.

* `Model#setHistoryManager(HistoryManager)` -- Resets the `HistoryManager`
data to the given `HistoryManager` in the argument.

* `Model#getAvailableNumberOfExecutedCommands()` -- Gets the maximum available
number of commands that can be undone.

* `Model#getAvailableNumberOfInverselyExecutedCommands()` -- Gets the maximum
available number of commands that can be redone.

* `Model#canRollback()` -- Checks if it is possible to undo a command at the
given state.

* `Model#canCommit()` -- Checks if it is possible to redo a command at the
given state.

* `Model#rememberExecutedCommand(Command)` -- Remembers the given `Command`
and stores it in `executedCommands` to facilitate undo capability for this
command.

* `Model#rememberInverselyExecutedCommand(Command)` -- Remembers the given
  `Command` and stores it in `inverselyExecutedCommands` to facilitate redo
capability for this command.

* `Model#rollback()` -- Inversely executes the latest command stored in
  `executedCommands` to revert the changes of the latest executed command
made onto `Model`.

* `Model#commit()` -- Executes the latest undone command stored in
  `inverselyExecutedCommands` to reapply the changes that were made onto
  `Model` by the latest undone command.

Commands support the given operations to mutate the state of the `Model` and
to check if they should be stored for undo/redo function:

* `Command#hasInverseExecution()` -- Checks if the command's execution mutates
the state of the `Model`, which is used to determine if the command should
be remembered by `HistoryManager`.

* `Command#execute(Model)` -- Executes the command on the given `Model`.

* `Command#executeInverse(Model)` -- Executes on the given `Model` such that
it will undo whatever changes were made when `Command#execute(Model)` was
called.

Below is a class diagram between `Model`, `ModelManager`, `HistoryManager`,
`CommandDeque` and `Command`.

Undo and redo operations are executed with `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`
These commands store an integer value referencing the number of commands to
undo or redo, represented by `UndoCommand#numberOfTimes` and
`RedoCommand#numberOfTimes`. The Class Diagram below shows details about
`UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`.

Below are two sequence diagrams of how a `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`
executes in the program. The sequence diagrams below show the process of undo
and redo of a single command for simplicity and clarity.

Below is a sequence diagram of how an `UndoCommand` to undo a single command
executes in the program.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how undo/redo mechanism behaves.

==== User Scenario demonstrating undo/redo

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The
`HistoryManager` is initialized. `HistoryManager#executedCommands` and
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands` are empty.

Step 2. The user executes `delete-cca 1` command to delete the 1st person
in Jarvis. A `DeleteCcaCommand` is created and executed in
`LogicManager#execute(String)`. Since `DeleteCcaCommand` is an
*invertible command*, `HistoryManager` stores the command, adding it
to `HistoryManager#executedCommands`.

[NOTE]
`HistoryManager` stores *invertible commands*, not *non-invertible commands*.

Step 3. The user executes `add-task t/todo des/Revise CS2103T` to add a new
todo. A `AddTaskCommand` is created and executed in `LogicManager#execute(String)`.
Since `AddTaskCommand` is an invertible command, `HistoryManager` stores the
command, adding it to `HistoryManager#executedCommands`.

[NOTE]
If a invertible command execution fails, `HistoryManager` will not remember
it, therefore it will not be stored for undo/redo function. Therefore,
`HistoryManager` will be guaranteed to store only commands that have executed
or inversely executed on the `Model` successfully.

Step 4. The user now decides that the last two commands entered was a mistake,
and decides to undo those commands by executing the `undo 2`. A `UndoCommand`
is created and executed in `LogicManager#execute(String)`, where
`UndoCommand#numberOfTimes` is 2. The command calls `Model#rollback()` twice.
Each time `Model#rollback()` is called, the `Model` will call `HistoryManager`
to take the latest command from `HistoryManager#executedCommands` and call
`Command#executeInverse(Model)` on the `Model`, undoing the changes made to
`Model` by the command when it was first executed before being stored in
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands`. Then the command is added to
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands`. After the `undo 2` command execution
is complete, the `Model` state is reverted to what it was before the two undone
commands were first executed. Since `UndoCommand` is a *non-invertible* command,
it is not stored by `HistoryManager` after its execution.

[NOTE]
`undo`/`redo` commands can undo/redo one or more commands. To undo/redo one
command, entering `undo`/`redo` is equivalent to entering  `undo 1`/`redo 1`.
 +
 +
If an `undo`/`redo` command is given to undo/redo more commands than
available, the operation will fail and no `undo`/`redo` is applied at all.
This check is enforced by `Model#getAvailableNumberOfExecutedCommands()`,
`Model#getAvailableNumberOfInverselyExecutedCommands()`, `Model#canRollback()`
and `Model#canCommit()`.
 +
 +
If an `undo`/`redo` command fails at any point in undoing/redoing one or more
commands, all changes made during the command will be reverted and `Model`
will be in the state that it was in before the `undo`/`redo` command was
executed.

Step 5. The user decides to execute the command `list-history`. A
`ListHistoryCommand` is created an executed in `LogicManager#execute(String)`.
The command calls `Model#getAvailableNumberOfExecutedCommands()` and
`Model#getAvailableNumberOfInverselyExecutedCommands()`, and sends a message
to the user indicating the number of commands that can be undone and the
number of commands that can be redone. In this use case with reference to the
previous steps, there are zero commands that can be undone and two commands
that can be redone. Since `ListHistoryCommand` is a *non-invertible command*,
`HistoryManager` will not store it after its execution.

Step 6. The user decides to redo the last command that was undone by
executing a `redo` command by typing in the command `redo`. A `RedoCommand`
is created and executed in `LogicManager#execute(String)` to redo the latest
undo. The command will call `Model#commit()` once. `Model` will call
`HistoryManager` to take the latest command from
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands` and call `Command#execute(Model)`
on the `Model`, re-applying the changes that were undone. Then the command
is added to `HistoryManager#executedCommands`. After the `redo` command
execution is complete, the `Model` state is changed to when the redone command
was executed. Since `RedoCommand` is a *non-invertible command*, it is not
stored by `HistoryManager` after its execution.

Step 7. The user executes `add-course c/CS2103T` to add a course. A
`AddCourseCommand` is created and executed in `LogicManager#execute(String).
Since `AddCourseCommand` is an *invertible command*, it is stored in
`HistoryManager` and the commands stored in
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands` is cleared. Therefore
the user can still undo commands but the commands that can be redone
are all cleared and will not be able to be redone.

[NOTE]
Commands stored in `HistoryManager` that were undone are not cleared
after executions of *non-invertible commands*. However, if a
*invertible command* is executed, commands that are undone and stored in
 `HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands` will be cleared. This is
similar to how navigation works between pages you visit in a browser tab.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class
is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the
  configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`
  which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the
  termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in
  debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file
location, logging level) through the configuration file (default:
`config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. **Initial Launch**

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

.. Double-click the jar file
+
**Expected**: Shows the GUI with a set of sample data in every feature. The window
size may not be optimal

. **Saving Window Preferences**

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different
   location. Close the window.

.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
+
**Expected**: The most recent window size and location is retained.

. **Storage**

.. Launch the application and make a change that changes the state of the
   program, such as `add-task` or `add-course`. Close the window.

.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
+
**Expected**: The app should re-launch into the same state as when it was
closed.

=== Deleting Data from a list

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all tasks using the `list-task` command. Multiple
   tasks in the list.

.. Test case: `delete-task 1`
+
**Expected**: First task is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted
contact shown in the status message.

.. Test case: `delete-task 0`
+
**Expected**: No task is deleted. Error details shown in the result display.
Status bar remains the same.

.. Other incorrect delete commands to try:

... `delete-task`
... `delete-task x` (where `x` is larger than the list size)
... `delete-task y` (where `y` is any alphanumeric character)
+
**Expected**: Similar to previous.

=== Saving data

. Missing data files

.. Run the app once and play around with the application. Once a change is
   made, the program will generate a data files in `./data/`

.. In `./data/`, delete `courseplanner.json`.

.. Re-launch the app.
+
**Expected**: Default Course data should now be present in the Courses tab.

. Corrupted data files

.. Run the app once and play around with the application. Once a change is
   made, the program will generate a data files in `./data/`

.. In `./data/`, open `courseplanner.json`. On line 2, delete the `[`:
+
----
1 {
2   "courses" : [ {
3 ...
----
+
should become
+
----
1 {
2   "courses" : {
3 ...
----

.. Re-launch the app.
+
**Expected**: Go to the Courses tab and the tab should not have any data.
`courseplanner.json` **still exists**.
