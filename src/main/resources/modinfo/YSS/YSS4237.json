    "description": "Some of the most important turning points in world history have resulted in, and from, territorial expansion and conquest of both inhabited and uninhabited frontiers. Many of the international laws we now take for granted emerged as the result of highly contentious and uncertain incursions into previously un-regulated domains. In this course, students will explore the root causes of state-led territorial expansion and the ramifications of conquest and domination for international law. We will analyse theories of conquest and delve into case studies of particular cases of expansion into inhabited territory (e.g. Japan\u2019s Co-Prosperity Sphere, United States\u2019 westward expansion across America, German expansion in Western and Eastern Europe) and state expansion into uninhabited frontiers (e.g. South China Sea disputes, airspace, outer space, Antarctica, the deep sea). Students will learn to analyse and critique competing arguments, synthesize explanatory lenses, and perform research into this arena of international politics and law.",
