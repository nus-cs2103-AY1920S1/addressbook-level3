[[Commands]]
== Commands
====
*Command Format*

* Names are limited to 40 alphanumeric characters.
* Phone numbers must be between 3 to 20 digits long.
****

=== Create new activity: `activity`

Creates a new activity with a title, contacts (optional) and no expenses.
****
* Additional contacts to add to the activity can be specified by using `p/` prefix.
** Initially, the application will search for contact with exact matching name.
** If no exact match is found, keyword matching is used instead. Refer to <<Finding contacts or activities: `find`>> for more details.
** For a contact to be successfully added, given keywords must have exact 1 matching contact. Otherwise, the activity will be created without adding the contact suggested by the keywords, and warning message will be shown.
* Changes the current view to this activity (as if `view a/ACTIVITY_ID` was called).
* Each activity will be assigned an activity ID automatically. +
****

Format: `activity t/ACTIVITY_TITLE [p/PERSON ...]`

Examples:

* `activity t/Chalet p/John Doe` +
Creates a new activity with title 'Chalet' John Doe as participants.

* `activity t/Breakfast p/David Li p/Bernice Yu` +
Creates a new activity with title 'Breakfast'. If the contact named 'Bernice Yu' doesn't exist, only the contact 'David Li' will be added in as a participant, and a warning message will be shown, stating that contact named 'Bernice Yu' could not be found.

=== Add contacts to an activity: `invite`

Adds a contact in the contact list to the currently viewed activity. Multiple contacts can also be added at once.
If there is no current viewed activity, then the contact cannot be added and there will be an error.
If the specified contact does not exist in the contact list, then the contact cannot be added and a warning message indicating non-unique search result will be shown instead.

Format: `invite p/PERSON ...`

Examples:

* `invite p/John Doe p/Mary` +
Adds both John Doe and Mary to the current viewed activity.

* `invite p/Mary p/David p/Alex` +
Adds David and Alex to the current viewed activity if they are found in the contact list. Mary will not be added into the activity again since she in already in the activity, a message indicating her existence in the activity will be shown instead.

=== Remove contacts from an activity: `disinvite`

Removes a contact from the currently viewed activity. Multiple contacts can also be removed at once.
If there is no current viewed activity, then the contact cannot be removed and there will be an error.
If the specified contact does not exist in the current activity, a warning message indicating that the contact does not exist in the current activity will be shown instead.
If the specified contact is involved in an expense, he cannot be removed since he does not owe money to anyone and no one else owes him money and a warning message indicating that he is involved in an expense will be shown instead.

Format: `disinvite p/PERSON ...`

Examples:

* `disinvite p/John Doe p/Mary` +
Removes John Doe and Mary from the current activity. If any one of them are involved in expenses, none of them will be removed.

// tag::expense[]
=== Add expenses to an activity : `expense`

Creates a new expense with a list of contacts, an amount and an optional description, and adds it to the currently viewed activity. The first contact in the list is taken to be the person who paid for the expense, and the remaining people will be counted as owing the first person money. Any duplicated person will be ignored. +

If only one contact is specified in the list, then SplitWiser will assume that all current participants in the activity are involved in this expense and thus owe this person money. +

If no activity is being viewed, the description is compulsory - a new activity will instead be created with the same title as the description (as if `activity t/ACTIVITY_NAME` was called). The expense and contact(s) will then be added to the activity. +

Format: `expense p/PERSON e/AMOUNT_PAID [p/PERSON ...] [d/DESCRIPTION]`

****
* Exactly one expense amount must be provided.
* The amount specified will be rounded to 2 decimal places.
* After rounding, the allowable expense amount for any single expense is from $0.01 to $1,000,000.
****

Examples:

* `expense p/John Doe e/100` +
Adds a single expense of $100 by John Doe to the currently viewed activity. If John Doe is not in the current activity, an error will occur and no expense will be created. Otherwise, all existing participants of the activity will now owe John a portion of the $100. +
If no activity is currently viewed, an error will occur as there is no description provided to use for automatic activity creation to contain this expense.
* `expense p/Mary e/100 p/Joseph p/Silva d/Drinks` +
Adds an expense of $100 to the currently viewed activity by Mary where Joseph and Silva are involved i.e. Joseph and Silva owe Mary a portion of the $100. This expense will be named `Drinks`. If any one of the participants are not in the present activity, then an error will occur and no expense will be created. +
Alternatively, if no activity is currently viewed, an activity titled `Drinks` will be created to contain this expense. Mary, Joseph and Silva will then be added to the activity.

NOTE: It is in fact possible to add an expense where no one else is involved in by specifying that the people involved only include the person who is paying, +
e.g. `expense p/John Doe e/15 p/John Doe d/Cab` +
This adds an expense of $15 by John Doe called `Cab` where only John himself is involved, thus no one owes anyone anything. This can be used to add an expense simply for recording purposes if desired, though it is not an intended use case for SplitWiser since there is no debt to calculate and resolve.
// end::expense[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Edit an existing contact or activity : `edit`

Edits some details of the current contact or activity in view. Note that contact names must be unique, so if a specified name already exists in the address book, the edit will not be processed. +

Format: `edit [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [tag/TAG] ...` for contacts OR `edit [t/ACTIVITY_TITLE]` for activities.

****
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Irrelevant parameters will be ignored. For example, `edit p/999 t/new title` when viewing an activity will only update the title to `new title`, and `p/999` will be ignored.
* Expenses cannot be edited.
****

Examples:

* `edit p/999` +
Edits the phone number of the current contact in view to `999`. No changes are made if a contact is not being viewed.
* `edit t/BBQ` +
Edits the title of the current activity in view to `BBQ`. No changes are made if an activity is not being viewed.
// end::edit[]

=== Finding contacts or activities (v1.4): `find`

Finds contacts or activities whose name or title respectively contain *any* of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD ...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name of contacts and title of activities are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Contacts and activities matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find John` +
Returns contacts (e.g. `john` and `John Doe`) and activities (e.g. `John birthday party`).
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any contact or activity whose name or title contains the word `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`.

=== Deleting a contact, activity or expense (v1.4) : `delete`

Deletes the specified index from the current list view. Delete can also be used to delete all entries by not specifying any index, but the user will be prompted to confirm this action.

If viewing a contact instead, the contact will be deleted.

If viewing an activity instead, it will delete an expense* by index. Not specifying any index will result in the current activity being deleted. +

Multiple entries can be deleted at once.

Format: `delete [INDEX] ...`

****
* Deletes the entry at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact or activity or expense list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* *Expenses cannot be completely deleted. It will instead be struck off (but still visible) in the activity view, and moved to the bottom of the list.
****

Examples:

* `delete 2` +
If viewing the list of contacts, deletes the 2nd person by index. +
If viewing a contact, deletes the contact. +
If viewing the list of activities, deletes the 2nd activity by index. +
If viewing an activity, strikes off (soft-deletes) the 2nd expense by index.
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st entry (either a contact or activity) in the results of the `find` command.

=== Assign an activity as a sub-activity: `assign` (*v2.0 only*)

Assigns an activity as a sub-activity of the currently viewed activity. If no activity is currently being viewed, or an invalid activity ID is provided, no change is made.

Multiple activities can be assigned at once.

Format: `assign a/ACTIVITY_ID ...`

Examples:

* `assign 3 5`
If viewing an activity with title 'Family trip', assigns the activities with IDs 3 and 5 as sub-activities of 'Family trip'. Otherwise does nothing.

Multiple activities can be resolved at once.

Format: `close a/ACTIVITY_ID ...`

Examples:

* `close 3 4` +
Marks the activities with activity ID 3 and 4 as resolved, updating the aggregated debt of their participants.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Format: `exit`

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the application on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file contained in your current SplitWiser folder.

// tag::poweruser[]
== Powerusers

Certain features are not included intentionally, as some of them may potentially result in undefined behavior.
Hence, everything covered in this section is performed by *you* in the explicit knowledge that *something might break*!

=== Force deleting expenses
The default behavior for `disinvite` is to never allow permanant deletion for expenses.
What you will see instead is that it is striked out in the UI.
This is for good reason!
It preserves accountability and transparency.

You can however forcibly delete an expense by editing the `data/activitybook.json` file if you so incline.
Before anything, find out the `ID` of the expense that you wish to remove (this is different from the `#` index shown on the right of the GUI).
Ensure the application is closed, then find the activity in question in the `json`, and edit the `expenses` field as you wish.

After restarting you will see that the expense is permanantly removed from the activity.
The debts will have been recalculated as though it was never there.

CAUTION: Deleting an expense does not care about the existing debts caused by that expense!

=== Force disinvite from activity

[quote, User Guide on the disinvite command]
____
If a contact is involved in an expense, he/she cannot be removed.
____

To forcibly remove a contact from an activity, you will have to edit `data/activitybook.json`.
Before anything, find out the `ID` of the person that you wish to remove (this is different from the `#` index shown on the right of the GUI).
You should also be extremely sure that the contact is not involved in any other activities or expenses.
Ensure the application is closed, then find the activity in question in the `json`, and edit the `participants` field as you wish.

After restarting you will see that the person is permanantly removed from the activity.

CAUTION: This operation is very dangerous! The person might be included in expenses or other activities -- in that case, an error will be generated and the application will reset.
