== PROJECT: TagLine

== Overview

This portfolio is made to summarize my contribution in my CS2103T project.

My team, which consists of 5 CS students, was asked to develop an address book application as part of our project
assignment.

After some discussion, we decided to morph the application into a note management app called as Tagline which utilizes
several types of tags in order to helps its user in managing their notes efficiently.

Following are the screenshot of Tagline:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I added `note tag` and `note untag` commands in TagLine.
** What it does: This command allow user to tag its note with any of three types of tags in tagline.
** Justification: This tagging feature along with the filtering `note list` command will help its user to manage
their notes efficiently.

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented `Hash Tag` model.
** What it does: Hash Tag is one of the three types of tags which helps its user to categorize their notes with topics.

* *Minor enhancement*: I refactored `contact model` from address book
** What it does: Tagline has an address book integrated inside of it. Therefore, we decided to reuse some part of AB3.
However, we need to do some minor tweak so that it suits our app well.
