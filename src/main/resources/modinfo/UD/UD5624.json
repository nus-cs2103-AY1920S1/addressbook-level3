    "description": "The module is to provide students the in-depth understanding of urban form analysis, urban form making and development processes over extended spatial and temporal environment through various urban design cases and theories. As one of the essential courses of urban design, the lecture/seminar is going to introduce not only the historical legacy but also those cutting-edge thinking for the future. The discussion will cover many discourses related to how cities and urban spaces could be analyzed, designed, managed, evaluated, represented and changed. The original thought of city form and design from Kevin Lynch is regarded as the starting point for the whole module. The following sessions will cover those new trends and issues in different specific urban design topics, such as downtown urban design, urban regeneration, Asian urbanism and large-scale project development, waterfront redevelopment, transit village, sustainable city, landscape ecological design, information city, the emerging technologies for urban simulation and finally the making of urban design plan.",
