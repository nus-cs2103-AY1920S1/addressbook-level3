    "description": "The Leadership Skills Assessment and Development Module aims to develop students\u2019 self-awareness. Selfawareness helps to understand why we do things the way we do. It also helps to understand the people around us. How they perceive us, our attitudes, and our behaviors and why they react to us the way they do. This understanding allows us to break routines and to learn new ways of dealing with the challenges we encounter. Hence, the more we know about our self, including our strengths, weaknesses, motivations, needs, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, desires, habits, and assumptions, the better we are able to adapt to change, learn, and direct our future.",
