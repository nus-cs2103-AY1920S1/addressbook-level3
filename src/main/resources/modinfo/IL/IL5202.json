    "description": "The pervasive use of the Internet and technology for the conduct of business, and the complexity of organizations mandate the adoption of an effective and pragmatic IT governance and risk management framework to bind business and IT strategies. This will allow companies to reap the full benefit of exploiting IT to meet business goals and sustain competitive advantage. The urgency is further compounded by the recent high profile cases on data leakage and system breaches. IT governance risk and compliance (IT GRC) is therefore now a top priority for IT leaders. This course presents a holistic overview of IT GRC.",
