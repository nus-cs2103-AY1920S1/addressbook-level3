    "description": "The central theme of this course is what to measure and how to measure, when assessing the effects of marketing tactics. Evaluation and control are essential strategic marketing processes and the basis of evaluation and control is measurement. We will examine such questions as:\n\u2022 How to measure customer satisfaction and brand attitudes?\n\u2022 How much will sales have to increase to justify expanding the sales force?\n\u2022 What will be the effect on total firm profit from eliminating the poorest performing customers? \n\u2022 What is the lifetime value of a customer?\n\u2022 How will a price cut affect sales?\n\u2022 How can conjoint analysis be used to evaluate new product concepts?\n\u2022 What are the long term effects of sales promotions?\n\u2022 What are the effects of advertising?\nThe course will also focus on performance \u201cdashboards\u201d, which allow executives to monitor, analyze and manage the business. Dashboards can be both tactical and strategic in their orientation, but always involve collecting and summarizing data, preparing key performance indicators (KPI\u2019s), and bringing this information together in a form relevant to marketing decisions on an ongoing basis.",
