    "description": "What to listen for in fugues using Bach\u2019s collection as an omnibus guide. Students are introduced to structural listening as the primary mode of engaging content in this music. Bach\u2019s fugues demonstrate a wide range of expressions and techniques that are found in the works of many other composers, so analytical techniques learned in the seminar can be applied generally. No composition work required. Ability to read music in treble and bass clefs assumed, with further knowledge of keys, scales, and meters prerequisite. No prior work in harmony or counterpoint is necessary.",
