    "description": "Understanding environmental economics and how it affects policy decisions is an important part of modern policy making. This module builds on the gateway module (PP5451 Foundations of Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics) and introduces advanced level economic analyses of natural resource management. The analyses involve critical reviews of concepts and methods in both microeconomics and macroeconomics leading to the formulation of resource management policies some of which deviate from acknowledged norms. Central to both the microeconomic and macroeconomic analyses is the recognition of the role of laws of thermodynamics and ecological systems balance on the functioning of economic systems.",
