= Introduction

NurseTraverse is designed for community nurses who make home visits to their patients. It is a computer app that will allow nurses to keep track of their patients' data, appointments and visits. NurseTraverse is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

= Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `nurvetraverse.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your NurseTraverse app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`app-help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`pat-list`* : lists all patients
* **`pat-add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to NurseTraverse.
* **`pat-delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`app-exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Parameters are additional pieces of information required/used when running a command.
* Items in square brackets are *optional* e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Diabetic` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items that are not in square brackets are required e.g. `n/NAME` from the `pat-add` command.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Diabetic`, `t/Diabetic t/Fever` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Due to the number of commands, each command will follow the syntax of `*ENTITY ACTION [PARAMETERS]*`. For example, if you wanted to delete a patient, you would do something like `pat-delete 3`.
