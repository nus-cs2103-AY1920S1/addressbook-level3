    "description": "This module introduces the concepts that serve as a basis for hundreds of programming languages. It aims to provide the students with a basic understanding and appreciation of the various essential programming-languages constructs, programming paradigms, evaluation criteria and language implementation issues. The module covers concepts from imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic, constraints, and concurrent programming. These concepts are illustrated by examples from varieties of modern object-oriented, functional, and logic programming languages. The module also introduces various implementation issues, such as pseudo-code interpretation, static and dynamic semantics, abstract machine, type inferencing, etc.",
