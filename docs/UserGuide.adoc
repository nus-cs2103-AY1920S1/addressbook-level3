With just a few simple commands, this delivery manager can help to kickstart your delivery service.

**Command Types**

* In *DeliveryMANS*, there are 2 types of commands: universal commands and context-specific commands.
* Universal commands can be called under any context in the application.
* Context-specific commands can only be accessed in a specific context. Context-specific commands comprise customer,
restaurant and deliverymen commands, which can only be called under the customer, restaurant and deliverymen context
respectively.


**Command Format**

* Command words for universal commands are prepended with "-" *(not for now)*
** Example Usage: `help`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add_order c/CUSTOMER r/RESTAURANT f/FOOD q/QUANTITY`,
`CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `FOOD` and `QUANTITY` are parameters to be supplied.
** Example Usage: `add_order c/Donald Trump r/KFC f/Chicken Bucket q/100`

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times e.g. `f/FOOD...` can be used 1 or more:
** Example Usage: `f/3 Piece Chicken Meal` or `f/Pepperoni Pizza f/Char Kway Teow`

* Items with `[]` are optional and can be ommitted e.g. `[t/TAG]...`
