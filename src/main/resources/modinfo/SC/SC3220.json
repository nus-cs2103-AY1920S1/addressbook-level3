    "description": "Ritual, performance and symbolism have been core areas in social science analysis for some time. Initially studies of symbolism focussed on non-industrial peoples, whose ritual lives were very rich and visible. Increasingly social scientists have come to see that ritual is still an important activity in the contemporary world, and that analyzing performances can give us insights into nationalism, sports, tourism, media and other areas of life that deal with questions of identity. This course will offer students an overview of these important topics, in order to better understand communication, identity and community in the modern world.",
