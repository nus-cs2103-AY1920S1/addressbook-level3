    "description": "This module aims to produce chemical engineers who can contribute and increase the effectiveness of problem solving in the Chemical Process Industries. It introduces robust heuristics and a systematic approach to problem solving, which combines critical and creative thinking with technical knowledge. The skill development is delivered through the presentation of various problem-solving strategies and techniques, and by applying them to real case studies from a few diverse process industries.",
