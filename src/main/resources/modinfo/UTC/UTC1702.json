    "description": "This will serve as an umbrella module for all Junior Seminars in Residential College 4. Each module under this umbrella will focus on a specific socially relevant theme to cultivate a 'big picture' thinking in students and help them to visualize how interconnections and interdependencies between various actors of a system result in interesting and complex behaviors. Students will develop qualitative and quantitative diagrammatic models using computational tools to analyze the theme of interest from multiple perspectives (social, economical, political etc.) and will use them to gain better understanding of issues and capacity for broader and deeper conversations.",
