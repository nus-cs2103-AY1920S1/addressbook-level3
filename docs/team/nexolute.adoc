== PROJECT: IchiFund

'''

== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions towards the project, IchiFund,
which is part of a software engineering module, CS2103T.
My team decided to morph an existing address book software into a
desktop finance management application for university students who prefer
using a command-line interface. We call this application IchiFund.

My role was to develop the https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-w12-4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#budgets[Budgets]
component and design the user interface for the application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Developed the `Model`, `Logic`, `Storage`, and `Ui`
infrastructure for budgeting features.
** Functionality: Provides the foundation on which features related to budget,
such as `add`, `delete`, and `find`, are built upon.
** Justification: The ability to read, create, delete, and find budgets on the
application depends on the budget infrastructure. With this infrastructure in
place, it is easy to implement and extend the budgeting features within IchiFund.
** Highlights: This enhancement is part of the core features in IchiFund. The
ability to implement this enhancement demonstrates a deep understanding of the
underlying MVC design pattern of the original addressbook3 codebase. This is
clearly highlighted when I introduced a `Task` abstraction to update all budgets
upon an update of any transaction.

* *Minor enhancement*:
- Redesigned the user interface from bottom up (PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/131[#131]).
- Added the ability to add transactions (PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/99[#99]).
- Added the ability to delete transactions (PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/103[#103]).
- Added the ability to find transactions (PR https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-4/main/pull/163[#163]).
