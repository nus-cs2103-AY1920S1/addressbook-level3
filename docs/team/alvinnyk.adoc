== PROJECT: TimeBook

---

== Overview


My team was tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop addressbook book application for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to morph it into scheduler application called *TimeBook*. Our application aims to help NUS (National University of Singapore) students
keep track of their schedules and that of their peers. It has unique features such as NUSmods integration, GoogleMaps enabled location suggestion service,
as well as the ability to generate common free time slots among the a group of individual schedules.

*TimeBook*

My main role was to design a model for users to input their schedules, as well as the schedules of their peers.
I also implemented an algorithm that generates a combined schedule of a group of schedules that shows the overview
of the group's schedule, as well as the common free time slots in the group.

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail as well as the relevant documentation I
have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of Contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: Schedule Generator
** *What it does*:
*** Allows the user to generate a combined schedule of any number of people. It also deconflicts the combined schedule
and generates the common free time slots among the members. The user is also able to see the event, timings and venues
of each member's schedule in the combined schedule.
** *Justification*:
*** The schedule of a typical NUS student is usually very busy. Finding the best time to meet up among a group can be a
hassle as not everyone is free at certain times. Typically, NUS students have to painstakingly deconflict everyone's schedules
in order to find a common free time to meet up. This feature removes this hassle by combining the schedules of a group of
people, deconflicting the schedules and shows which are the time slots where everyone is free.
** *Highlights*:
*** This feature works closely with external data sources such as NUSMods API(Application Programming Interface) to
easily import their NUSmod timetables, as well as GoogleMaps API to show to the user the location of each of the time slots.

* *Minor Enhancements*:

** *Select Command*:
*** Allows the user to select any time slot on the schedule. It will generate a pop up window that shows the user
details of the time slot such as the event name, timings and the location on Google Maps. (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/259[#259])

** *Implemented Websocket*:
*** Allows the application to access external data sources such as NUSmods and GoogleMaps API. (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/42[#42], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/43[#43], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/44[#44])


* *Other Contributions*:

** Morphing and Enhancement of Existing Features:
*** Morphed existing model for use in TimeBook (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/56[#56], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/149[#149], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/265[#265])
*** Implemented new commands to interact with model (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/56[#56], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/162[#162])
*** Implemented storage component to save model data(Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/70[#70])
** Application Testing:
*** Wrote tests for model and logic component and increased coverage by a total of 11% (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/257[#257], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/262[#262], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-4/main/pull/266[#266])
