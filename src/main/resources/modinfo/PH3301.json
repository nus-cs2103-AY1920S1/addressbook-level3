    "description": "This is the second part of a two part course\n\nwhich offers an introduction to philosophical\n\ndebate in the Warring States period of ancient\n\nChina, the Classical Age of Chinese Philosophy\n\nand the seedbed from which grew all of the\n\nnative currents of thought that survived from\n\ntraditional China. Continuing from Part I, we\n\nwill be discussing Later Mohist Logic, Gongsun\n\nLong and other \u2018Sophists\u2019, Zhuangzi, Xunzi and\n\nHanfeizi in this module. The approach of the\n\ncourse will be both historical and critical, and\n\nwe will attempt to both situate Classical\n\nChinese philosophical discourse in its\n\nintellectual-historical context and to bring out\n\nits continuing relevance.",
