    "description": "The principal objective of this course is to provide an understanding and appreciation of the various legal issues and perspectives involved in carrying out business and corporate transactions in India. The course will begin with a brief introduction to India\u2019s legal system, the Constitution and the judiciary so as to set the tone. This part will also contain an evaluation of the changes since 1991 to India\u2019s economic policies that have made it an emerging economic superpower. Thereafter, it will deal with the core through a discussion of the legal aspects involved in setting up business operations in India, the different types of business entities available, shareholders\u2019 rights, joint ventures, raising finance both privately and by accessing public capital markets, and the regimes relating to foreign direct investment, corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions and corporate bankruptcy. Where applicable, the course will provide relevant comparisons with similar laws in other jurisdictions such as the U.S., the U.K. and Singapore. While the course is not intended to involve an exhaustive study of all applicable laws and regulations, it will highlight key legal considerations for business transactions in India and allow for deliberation on topical, contemporary issues with real-world examples.",
