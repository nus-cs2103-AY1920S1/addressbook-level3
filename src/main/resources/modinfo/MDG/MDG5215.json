    "description": "Advancements in medicine and the biosciences are often, if not always, co-produced with ethical, economics and legal/regulatory norms. For this reason, the ability to understand and articulate what these normative conditions (and requirements) are is just as critical to being an effective researcher as technical excellence. This module initiates students to the normative components (i.e. ethical, legal and to a more limited extent economic norms and determinants) of biomedical sciences and technologies. It also aims to help students develop skills of critical thinking and ethical analysis; to explore the impact of developments in medicine and the biosciences; and to encourage interdisciplinary dialogue. Key components of this module will relate to: \u2022 Introduction to Ethical and Legal Theories (as well as Economic theories to a more limited degree); \u2022 Ethics, Medicine and Biotechnology; \u2022 Regulatory norms and practices in Singapore and key scientific jurisdictions; and \u2022 Key Issues in Research Ethics.",
