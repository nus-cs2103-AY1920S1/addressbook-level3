    "description": "This seminar examines the relationship between private\n\nwealth and political power. Most polities claim to\n\npursue public ends, yet many leaders have close links to\n\nprivate money. In democracies, elections are supposed\n\nto produce accountable officials, yet campaigns depend\n\non funding from corporations and individuals. This\n\nmodule addresses questions about the \u2018dirty\u2019 side of\n\npolitics and how private financing of political campaigns\n\ncould be regulated: Why does vote-buying occur in\n\nsome situations but not others? What is the role of\n\norganised crime in the business-politics nexus? How\n\nrepresentative are elected leaders if they are also\n\nindebted to campaign financiers? These themes have\n\nwide relevance and we will study them in a variety of\n\ncontexts, from local struggles in the developing world\n\nto American presidential elections.",
