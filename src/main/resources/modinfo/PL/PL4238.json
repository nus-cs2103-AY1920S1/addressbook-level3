    "description": "Social Neuroscience uses biological concepts and methods to understand social emotion and behaviour. Topics to be covered include the neural basis of selfrepresentation and theory of mind; the neural signature of social pain and social reward; and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cooperation, emotion regulation, and inequity aversion. The influence of culture on the neural responses to social stimuli and the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders such as autism will also be explored. In this module, we will review seminal and most recent research on these topics and discuss implications for understanding human behaviour.",
