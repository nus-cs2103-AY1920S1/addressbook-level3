    "description": "This freshman seminar expands the students' perspective on generations by engaging them in a critical understanding of the multidisciplinary field of intergenerational studies. What happen when generations drift apart? what happen when generations unite? How are generations construced in consumption, care, policies, familial and extra-familial relations across cultures? The seminar engages the students through ethnographic texts, films, policy case studies, field trips and their own reflections on intergenerational exchanges.",
