    "description": "This course considers the short story as a highly mobile modern genre, circulated globally through magazine and newspaper publication and translation. Concentrating on the work of several important writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, we will explore the formal and contextual elements of stories from a variety of geographical locations (Africa, North America, South America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe). We will also consider the manner in which these stories engage with the political, ideological, technological, and social transformations that constitute global modernity.",
