== AddMin+   -  All in One Administration App
AddMin+ is an all in one administration desktop application, that is specially designed for ABC Company, which is a tech startup company with only 6 full-time employees. ABC Company is still a relatively small company and it could only afford to hire 1 full-time employee to deal with all administrative matters.

* AddMin+ is specially designed to help ease the workload by offering a one-stop platform to help deal with the various administrative needs of the company.
* AddMin+ uses a Command Line Interface(CLI) and displays the results through a Graphical User Interface(GUI) to assist the employee in their specific needs.
