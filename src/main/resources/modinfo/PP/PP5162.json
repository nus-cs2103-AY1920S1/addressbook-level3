    "description": "The family is the fundamental building block of society and the level at which many important decisions such as fertility and retirement are made. This module discusses a) how families are formed and dissolved, b) how families make decisions in terms of division of labour and allocation of resources; and c) drivers of inequalities within and between families. We will use the economic perspective to explain dramatic changes to the family unit sweeping across Asia and the rest of the world. Students will have a chance to apply these insights to policy case studies in an Asian or comparative context.",
