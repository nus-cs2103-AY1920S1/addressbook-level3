    "description": "The European Union is often viewed as an economic superpower but a military pygmy. This module aims to provide students with tools to evaluate whether the EU, as a non-state actor, can have a coherent and effective foreign policy. It considers theories and debates concerning the institutionalisation of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), and includes case studies of EU objectives and actions on selected issues (international trade, ethics, human security), in selected regions (Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa), and in relations with international organizations such as the UN.",
