****
Hello! My name is Kerwin Lim. I'm a Computer Science Major at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I'm currently in my second year of studies.

This portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of TutorAid. TutorAid is a project that my team and I completed for our CS2103T module. We have put in our heart and soul creating TutorAid. It has been a tremendous learning journey for my team and I and we hope that users will enjoy and benefit from our product!

== PROJECT: TutorAid

== Overview

TutorAid is a useful application created for Tutors, by Tutors. The purpose of our application is to be a all encompassing solution to store information such as notes and reminders. Our product is made for tutors and teaching assistants in NUS. However, we have plans to expand to tutors in general. +

TutorAid is a comprehensive solution with complete integration of its features. Some of its features include: tasks, reminders, notes, student profile and earnings. Our features have been tailored to suit the needs of our target audience.
By storing their information in one central location, tutors' workspace can be made more organized. This can help improve productivity and enable a smooth workflow. A clear space is indeed a clear mind. +

TutorAid is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based tool that caters to professionals adept at typing. We have recently added more Graphical User Interface (GUI) features to make TutorAid more user friendly and to increase efficiency.

== Role

My main role was to prototype and develop the Reminders feature, the Calendar feature and make enhancements to the Graphical User Interface.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Reminders Feature*
** What it does: allows users to add Reminders. These will then be displayed in a reminders window that will pop up and remind users of urgent tasks.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users can be reminded of urgent and important tasks at hand. This will ensure that users have ample time to plan and complete their tasks punctually.
** Highlights: This feature allows users to create, remove and find Reminders. It required an in-depth analysis of design as it is also linked to the the Tasks feature. Users can create reminders for a specific task when creating said task. This highlights TutorAid's integration of all features with each other.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Calendar Graphical User Interface*
** What it does: allows users to view their Tasks chronologically. These will be reflected on the Calendar in Calendar View. Calendar View helps users keep track of tasks and plan their schedule better.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view their overall schedule. This can help users locate their busy periods and plan accordingly. It will also alert users of what tasks are due and when.
** Highlights: Calendars have a plethora of benefits: helping users prioritize, stay on task, increase productivity etc. Its implementation required integrating with the Tasks feature to be able to accurately display the Tasks Description and Start Date. Clicking on a date will also bring up the list of tasks due on that particular date.
