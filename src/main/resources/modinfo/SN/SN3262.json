    "description": "This module is concerned with the political evolution of the Indian nation in two of its most formative periods: the late nationalist struggle from 1920-47 that led to the withdrawal of the colonial power; and the years of Jawaharlal Nehru's prime ministership, 1947-64. The module looks at both decolonisation and nation-building as processes characterised by debate and contestation in relation to (a) social, regional and group identity and (b) political rights and power. The module will study the impact of that debate and contestation on the character, institutions and political life of the nation.",
