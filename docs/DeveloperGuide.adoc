== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design


[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::uicomponent[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `FeedbackDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `ActivityListPanel`, `AccomodationListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
// end::uicomponent[]

// tag::logic[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `PlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a contact).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add activity n/Climb Fuji a/Mount Fuji")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add activity n/Climb Fuji a/Mount Fuji` Command

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// end::logic[]

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `ActivityManager`, `AccommodationManager`, `ContactManager` and `Itinerary` that represents the managers for activity, accommodation, contact and day respectively.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Activity>`, `ObservableList<Accommodation>`, `ObservableList<Contact>` and `ObservableList<Day>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
// end::model[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageUML.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* application data is split into 4 different components, `Accommodation`, `Activity`, `Contact`, `Itinerary`.

// end::storageuml[]
==== Accommodation Storage component
.Structure of Accommodation Storage component
image::AccommodationStorageUML.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/accommodation/AccommodationStorage.java[`AccommodationStorage.java`]

The `Accommodation Storage` component,

* can save `Accommodation` objects in json format and read it back.
* as `Tag is a field in Accommodation`, similarly JsonAdaptedTag is a field within JsonAdaptedAccommodation. Hence
the association as shown in the diagram above.
* as `Contact is a field in Accommodation`, similarly JsonAdaptedContact is a field within JsonAdaptedAccommodation. Hence
the association as shown in the diagram above.

==== Activity Storage component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/activity/ActivityStorage.java[`ActivityStorage.java`]

* can save `Activity` objects in json format and read it back.
* as `Tag is a field in Activity`, similarly JsonAdaptedTag is a field within JsonAdaptedActivity. Hence
the association as shown in the diagram above.
* as `Contact is a field in Activity`, similarly JsonAdaptedContact is a field within JsonAdaptedActivity. Hence
the association as shown in the diagram above.

==== Contact Storage component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/contact/ContactStorage.java[`ContactStorage.java`]

* can save `Contact` objects in json format and read it back.
* as `Tag is a field in Contact`, similarly JsonAdaptedTag is a field within JsonAdaptedContact. Hence
the association as shown in the diagram above.

==== Itinerary Storage component
.Structure of Itinerary Storage component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/day/ItineraryStorage.java[`ItineraryStorage.java`]

* can save `Itinerary` objects in json format and read it back.
* as `ActivityWithTime is a field in Day`, similarly JsonAdaptedActivityWithTime is a field within JsonAdaptedDay. Hence
the association as shown in the diagram above.
* as `Activity is a field in ActivityWithTime`, similarly JsonAdaptedActivity is a field within JsonAdaptedActivityWithTime.
Hence the association as shown in the diagram above.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.plannerbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
The `undo` command allows user to undo by one command (if the command is `undoable`).
The redo command allows user to return to the original state before latest undo.

==== Implementation

The undo/redo feature utilizes various classes to operate, such as `CommandHistory` class and the
classes within the `events package` in the logic component.

CommandHistory is a `static` class that contains the undoEventStack and redoEventStack of the application, each containing Events.

*KEY IDEA:*
|===
| *Event* -- Every UndoableCommand can be wrapped into its own unique Event. +
*undo/redo* -- Every Event has an undo and redo method. +
*EventFactory* -- An Event object is generated by the EventFactory when executing the UndoableCommand. +
|===

include::UserGuide.adoc[tag=undoredolist]

*Step 1.* The user executes an `UndoableCommand`.

*Step 2.* The UndoableCommand is executed, generating an `Event` in the process.

*Step 3.* `EventFactory` will parse the `UndoableCommand` to generate an Event. +
(eg. DeleteActivityCommand will result in DeleteActivityEvent generated)

[NOTE]
EventFactory is a static class that will parse an UndoableCommand and generate the corresponding Event.

*Step 4.* Event is added to `undoEventStack` stored in CommandHistory. The `redoEventStack` in
CommandHistory is also `cleared` upon generating a new Event.

*Step 5.* The UndoableCommand has been executed, returning a `CommandResult` to be shown.

*Step 6.* To undo the previous UndoableCommand, the user executes `undo` command. An `UndoCommand` is generated.

*Step 7.* `UndoCommand` is `not` an `UndoableCommand`. Executing the UndoCommand gets the Event from the top of undoEventStack
and calls the undo method of `Event`.

[NOTE]
Both UndoCommand and RedoCommand are not UndoableCommands, no Events are generated.

*Step 8.* The `Event` is popped from the undoEventStack and pushed to redoEventStack in CommandHistory. A CommandResult
is returned and the Event is `undone`.

*Step 9.* To redo the command that has been undone, the user executes `redo` command. A `RedoCommand` is generated and it
is `not` an `UndoableCommand`. This execution is similar to steps `6` and `7`, except Event is popped from redo stack instead and pushed to undo stack.

The *following two sequence diagrams* shows how the user's input is handled for `'delete activity 1'`.

The first diagram below shows the execution of `'delete activity 1'` command. It shows how the `Event` is generated and how the
`undoEventStack and redoEventStack is updated`.

.Executing delete activity
image::DeleteActivitySequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
When DeleteActivityCommand is executed, it generates the `activityToDelete` by extracting the `Activity` to be deleted from
the Model's list of activities based on the index specified in user's command input. It then calls the Model's
`deleteActivity` method.

The second diagram below shows the execution of `undo` command. Executing `UndoCommand` calls undo of the `DeleteActivityEvent`,
which returns an `AddActivityCommand` with the `Activity (initially deleted)` to be added back at the `correct index`.
Both Activity and Index were stored in `DeleteActivityEvent`. +

This new `AddActivityCommand` is executed, and the `DeleteActivityCommand` is successfully undone.

.Executing undo for 'delete activity'
image::UndoDeleteActivitySequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Each Event stores the `necessary data` required by the reverse Command to undo the effects of the initial
UndoableCommand. +
(eg. AddActivityEvent stores the `Activity added`, as `DeleteActivityCommand` requires the Activity to undo
the initial `AddActivityCommand's` changes)

The following *activity diagram* summarizes what happens when a user executes an UndoableCommand, an UndoCommand,
a RedoCommand, or any other Commands.

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user does not execute an UndoableCommand, UndoCommand or RedoCommand, the stack of Events in CommandHistory will *not be affected*. +
(eg. view, list commands)

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
* **Option 1 :** Wrap every UndoableCommand in an Event class, which has undo and redo methods.
** Pros:
*** Uses less memory by storing Event objects rather than storing every state of the Model.
*** Convenient for future extensions for new Commands added. Just need to ensure for every UndoableCommand, there must be a Command
that is able to undo its changes.
*** Command classes obey Single Responsibility Principle, they do not need to know how to undo or redo itself, as it is
abstracted to their corresponding Event classes.
** Cons:
*** Every UndoableCommand requires another Command to undo its changes. Might be difficult to manage if more UndoableCommands
are added.
* **Option 2 :** Saves the entire Model data (comprising of accommodations, activities, contacts and days).
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
** Cons:
*** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. Expensive to store the various objects at every state.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Use of static class CommandHistory to store a stack of Events to undo, and a stack of Events to redo.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement and understand. Every Event object is generated through EventFactory and stored in CommandHistory.
** Cons:
*** Static class is used instead of Singleton implementation. No single instance of CommandHistory is created, cannot be
passed as a parameter to other methods and treated as a normal object, hence might pose a difficulty during extensions.
* **Option 2:** Create a HistoryManager class to store a single list of Model objects for undo/redo
** Pros:
*** Straightforward and easy implementation, storing a deep copy of Model whenever an UndoableCommand is executed.
** Cons:
*** Need to keep track of the Model object obtained from the list to set during Undo/Redo. Difficult to manage the pointer
in the list.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::optimise[]

=== Schedule optimisation
==== Implementation

Scheduled activities in a day can be modeled as a `Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)` where the `vertices` are the `activities` and an `edge` from 1 vertex to another means that the activities are `not overlapping`. Just like DAGs, there are `no cycles` within the schedule due to the linearity of time.
When the command is executed, an `adjacency list` is formed from the existing activities within the schedule. The paths are then traced, with the help of a utility method, from the adjacency list to find `all possible combinations` of activities such that there are no overlaps between activities. The list of paths are then sorted
by their total cost. If there are `multiple paths` with the `same total cost`, the one with the `most number of activities` is selected. The existing day is then replaced with a day that contains the new schedule made from the path.

* optimise INDEX_OF_DAY -- optimises and de-conflicts the schedule. This operation supports activities with or without
a cost. Activities without a cost have a default cost of $0.00.

Given below is a sample usage of the feature:

The user calls `optimise` command on an existing day with `overlapping activities` within its schedule. This results in a schedule `without overlaps` such that the `lowest overall cost` and the `most number of activities` if there are `multiple combinations` with the `same total cost`, such that the user's time is maximised.

Shown below is a summary of the execution of the command.

image::OptimiseSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
Aspect: Algorithm to de-conflict

* Alternative 1 (current): Find all combinations, if the total cost is the same, combination with more activities is selected.

** Pros:
*** Allow users to maximise time by squeezing more activities into the schedule.
*** Allow optimisation to cover more criteria such as cost, number of activities, etc.

** Cons:
*** Costly runtime.

* Alternative 2: Use Single Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithms to find a combination without conflicts.

** Pros:
*** Fast runtime.

** Cons:
*** Use of SSSP algorithms like Djikstra or Bellman Ford restricts the criteria of optimisation due to the limits of edge weight (i.e. cost).

Aspect: De-conflict process

* Alternative 1 (current): Model as a DAG and find combination with the lowest overall cost.

** Pros:
*** Easy for users to use, less hassle for indecisive users.

** Cons:
*** Less control for the user to choose activity.

* Alternative 2: Allow users to manually de-conflict by selecting individual activities they wish to keep.

** Pros:
*** Users have more control over activities.

** Cons:
*** Users have to enter multiple inputs to de-conflict.

// end::optimise[]

// tag::scheduleactivity[]
=== Schedule feature

*_Plan²travel_* allows user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time of a day.
This is accomplished by executing the `ScheduleCommand` with `activity index`, `start time` and  `day index`.

Eg. `schedule ACTIVITY_INDEX st/START_TIME d/DAY_INDEX`

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using `ScheduleCommandParser` which converts the string variable of start time into a LocalDateTime object, while activity index and day index are converted into Index objects.
These are then passed to the `ScheduleCommand` for execution later on.

Given below is a sequence diagram showing the creation of `ScheduleCommand`:

.Sequence diagram showing how ScheduleCommand is created.
image::ScheduleCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of `ScheduleCommand`, `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `ScheduleCommand`.

Below are the steps taken during the execution of `ScheduleCommand`:

1. `Model` will retrieve the list of days from the `Itinerary` and the list of activities from  `UniqueActivityList`.

2. The `activityIndex` and `dayIndex` will then be used to obtain the targeted `Activity` from activity list
and targeted `Day` from list of days.

3. `Activity` will be converted to `ActivityWithTime` using the `startDateTime` and `duration` of activity.

4. This `ActivityWithTime` is then added to the list of `ActivityWithTime` in the target `Day`.

5. The list of `ActivityWithTime` is sorted according ActivityWithTime startDateTime.


Given below is a sequence diagram showing the execution of `ScheduleCommand`:

.Sequence diagram showing how ScheduleCommand executes.
image::ScheduleCommandExecution.png[]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Update activities for that particular day

* **Current Choice:** Directly updates the activity list in the targeted `Day` class.
** Pros: Seem more intuitive and simple to implement.
** Cons: Might make it harder to debug error that surface if many other functions/classes also depends on the same `Day` class.
* **Alternative:** Create a new `Day` class with the new updated activity list to replace the targeted `Day` class.
** Pros: Easier for developer to test the code.
** Cons: Might create unnecessary overheads in the code by creating new object every time we schedule an activity.

// end::scheduleactivity[]

// tag::autoschedule[]
=== Auto Schedule feature
==== Rationale
There are times when users are planning for an overseas trip, there are so many activities in their activity list that they want to do but the problems faced are that they are unable to finish all the activities in the list or they are unable to find an optimal schedule plan.

==== Overview
The `autoschedule` command requires user to specify either the `tag name` or the `activity name` itself in order of the type of activity that they want.
For example, `t/shopping t/sightseeing t/dining` would means an activity of `shopping` type would be scheduled first followed by `sightseeing` and then `dining`.
Before using the autoschedule command, users are to fill up their activity list first and ensure that they have input the `duration` for each activity and are recommended to input their `priority` for those activities.
Afterwards, `autoschedule` would serve to ensure that the activities scheduled do not overlap, are according to what the users prioritised first and that all activities have a chance to be scheduled.


=== Implementation
The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AutoScheduleCommandParser` which converts all the `tag` or `name` prefix's argument with their respective `start time` ,if given, in `NameOrTagWithTime` class and stores them in a list to maintain the same ordering as given by the user.

If `address` is specified, it is wrapped in an `Address` class and if the `day index(es)` to schedule are specified, they stored in a list with each index wrapped in an `Index` class.
The `list of NameOrTagWithTime`, `address` and `list of day indexes` are then passed to the `AutoScheduleCommand` for execution later on.

Given below is a sequence diagram showing the creation of `AutoScheduleCommand`:

.Sequence diagram showing how `AutoScheduleCommand` is created.
image::AutoScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[]

Below are the steps taken when executing of the `AutoScheduleCommand`:

*Step 1.* `AutoScheduleCommand` will firstly get the `list of days` and `list of activities` from the `Model` class

*Step 2.* If address is specified, the `list of activities` will be filtered to get all activities that has the same `address`.

*Step 3.* If no `day indexes` to schedule are being specified, `AutoScheduleCommand` will generate a schedule for all `days`.

Below shows the checks taken by `AutoScheduleCommand`:

.Activity diagram showing how `AutoScheduleCommand` checks the requirement given by user:
image::AutoScheduleActivityDiagram1.png[]

After filtering the activity list, `AutoScheduleCommand` will proceed to begin preparation for the scheduling of the first activity of those specified day(s).

*Step 4.* It will filter the activity list that has been filtered by address to get all the activities with the same tag or activity name as the first activity to schedule.

*Step 5.* After which it will sort the list such that the activity that has not been scheduled will be scheduled first.It will ensure that for cases where both activities has not been scheduled before, the one with the higher priority will be scheduled first.

.Activity diagram showing how `AutoScheduleCommand` handles the preparation for the scheduling of the first activity:
image::AutoScheduleActivityDiagram2.png[]

*Step 6.* Next, `AutoScheduleCommand` will check if the chosen activity to be scheduled does not overlap with the start time of the next activity if user specify.

*Step 7.* If the chosen activity overlaps, it will traverse the filtered list, picking the next activity with the **next lowest count** in the itinerary and check if it overlaps.
The process will continue until it finds a suitable activity or it has finished traversing the whole filtered list. If it is planning for the last activity of the day, it will instead check whether the activity chosen overlap til the next day.

.Activity diagram showing how `AutoScheduleCommand` finds an activity to schedule:
image::AutoScheduleActivityDiagram3.png[]

Step 4 to Step 7 will repeat for the next activity to schedule for that day until it finished scheduling for that day or it could not find a suitable activity to schedule.
If there other days to schedule, the steps taken will also be the same as Step 4 to Step 7.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Counting the number of times similar activity of the same name or tag appears in the list
* **Current Choice:** Count the number of times all the similar activities appear in the itinerary every time we are planning to schedule an activity.
** Pros: It will ensure that the count number for the similar activities will always be right before they are chosen to be scheduled
** Cons: Slow down the program as we have to traverse through all the activities for each day everytime we are planning to schedule for an activity.
* **Alternative:** Have a counter inside the activity itself to keep track
** Pros: Significantly improve the runtime speed and less complicated to implement
** Cons: Over time, the count might be inaccurate due to multiple scheduling and unscheduling which alter the count number and we might not have keep track of it at certain point of time.

===== Aspect: Account for travelling time
* **Current Choice:** Allows user to input the start time of activity
** Pros: Gives user the flexibility and they are better able to gauge the travelling time of each activity
** Cons: It restrict the number of possible activities that could be scheduled as we have to consider activity not overlapping with the start time of the next activty.
* **Alternative:** Fix a break of 30min between every activity to acount for travel time
** Pros: Activities that user prioritised are more likely to be scheduled as we do not have to consider overlap of the start time of next activity.
** Cons: Certain activity may require more travelling time. If we fix a longer travelling time, it might not be optimising the schedule plan as certain activity might have shorter travelling time.
// end::autoschedule[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Auto Complete feature
==== Rationale
There are many commands to learn in our program and some of the commands can be wordy. In order to ease the learning curve and to help the user be productive as quickly as possible, autocomplete was implemented.

==== Implementation
*KEY IDEA:*

Every command in the planner can be broadly broken down into a few categories, namely:

. Command Word
. Preamble
. Required Prefix
.. That are used once
.. That are used multiple times
. Optional Prefix
.. That are used once
.. That are used multiple times

AutoCompleteSuggester makes use of this and checks the input for these categories one by one.

* If the input lacks the command word, then the best matching command word will be suggested.
* If the command word is provided, but the preamble is not (and it is required by the command), then the preamble will be suggested.
* If the input contains the command word and contains the preamble(when necessary), then the required prefixes and optional prefixes will be suggested. Since there are some prefix that should only be used, the input will be checked to see if these prefixes are present and remove them from the suggestions.

The `AutoCompleteParser` supports the `AutoCompleteSuggester` by parsing the user input into the command word, the preamble and a list of prefixes used in the program.

Given below is a sequence diagram showing the generation of suggestions:

.Sequence diagram showing the generation of suggestions.
image::AutoCompleteSuggesterSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Sub diagram for getPossibilities
image::AutoCompleteSuggesterGetPossibilitiesSequenceDiagram.png[]

Below is how the `autocomplete` feature is triggered:

*Step 1.* Modification in the text of `AutoCompleteTextField` is detected.

*Step 2.* If the input is empty, hide the pop-up box which contains the suggestions. If not empty, get entries (suggestions) for the pop-up box.

*Step 3.* If there are entries, populate the pop-up box with it. Else, hide the pop-up box.

*Step 4.* If pop-up box in previous step was populated, then show the pop-up box to the user.

.Activity diagram showing how the pop-up box containing the suggestions appears:
image::AutoCompleteActivityDiagram1.png[]

Below is how entries for the pop-up box is obtained:

*Step 1.* Check if input contains '<' or '>', as that would indicate that the user has accepted the suggestion of preamble, which has description enclosed with < and > (for e.g. <INDEX>) but has not replaced it with the actual preamble. If it has '<' or '>', then don't give suggestions to user.

*Step 2.* If the input does not contain '<' or '>', parse the command word.

*Step 3.* Next check if command word can be found. If it is not found, suggest command words that partially matches what the user has already inputted. If command word was found, do a check if there is a space at the end of the input.

*Step 3.* Next check if command word can be found. If it is not found, suggest command words that partially matches what the user has already inputted. If command word was found, do a check if there is a space at the end of the input.

*Step 4.* If there is no space, don't give suggestions to the user as it is assumed that the user is still typing. If there is a space, then parse preamble, parse prefix and make suggestions based on the command word, preamble and prefix present in the input.

.Activity diagram showing how entries for the pop-up box is generated:
image::AutoCompleteActivityDiagram2.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Underlying data structure to store the command words
* **Current Choice:** Use an ArrayList
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Might be slow in providing suggestion for the command word, as in the worse case, it needs to iterate through every command word entry and check with every entry.
* **Alternative:** Use a Trie
** Pros: Faster in providing suggestion for command word as it only has to iterate through the length of the input.
** Cons: More complicated to implement. The Trie also needs to be built during startup.

* **Reason for choice**: Given that the program does not have many commands and unlikely to have a significant number more commands in the future, search times are not an issue.

===== Aspect: Checking if the user has completed typing the command word/preamble/prefix content
* **Current Choice:** Assumes the user has finished the command word/preamble/prefix content when there is a whitespace at the end of input
** Pros: Simple to implement. Works in most cases.
** Cons: Might be wrong when suggesting new prefix as there are some commands like autoschedule that have prefixes that can have 2 arguments (autoschedule t/argument1 argument2 d/argument1 argument2...)
* **Alternative:** Waits for a specific duration of time before giving user suggestions
** Pros: More likely to provide suggestions when the user needs it.
** Cons: There might be a noticeable delay in the suggestions appearing if the specific duration is too long. More complicated to implement.
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable

==== Current Implementation

Internally, Timetable is a List of ActivityWithTime. This gives the Timetable flexibility to accept Activities that start and end at any time instead of fixed intervals (e.g. 30 minute intervals) while allow for conflicting ActivityWithTime.

==== Design considerations
* Alternative 1: an Array of time slots that stores Activity

** Pros: Simple and intuitive to implement. UI for itinerary is easier to implement too. Very fast access to each Activity in the Timetable.

** Cons: Constrained to fixed intervals. Hence, Activity start times and end times have to be in multiples of the fixed interval.

* Alternative 2: a TreeSet of ActivityWithTime

** Pros: Allows flexible start times and end times. Fast access to Activity in Timetable. Does not allow ActivityWithTime objects to have the same start times.

** Con: UI for itinerary might be difficult to implement as each the size of each block of ActivityWithTime in the UI is not the same. Does not allow for conflicting startDateTime between ActivityWithTime.

* Alternative 3(current choice): a List of ActivityWithTime

** Pros: Allows flexible start times and end times. ActivityWithTime can have the same startDateTime, thus allowing conflicting ActivityWithTime.

** Con: UI for itinerary might be difficult to implement as each the size of each block of ActivityWithTime in the UI is not the same. Slower access time if the size of the List is large.
// end::timetable[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* a student who is inexperienced in planning for overseas trips
* has a need to manage and schedule planner items
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Many students wish to go for overseas trips during their holidays. They may be inexperienced in
trip planning. These students would benefit from having a template as a way to organise the information they have for
their trip. Plan²travel can organise information faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
