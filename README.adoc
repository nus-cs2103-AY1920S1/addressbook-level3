* StudyBuddyPro is a desktop application to aid our studies.
* It has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is intended for *students in the School of Computing* at the *National University of Singapore*.
* Being highly familiar working with CLI, Computing Students can greatly benefit from the app to manage their studies efficiently and faster than traditional GUI apps.
