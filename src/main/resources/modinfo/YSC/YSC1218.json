    "description": "The fundamental building blocks of everything that surrounds us will be discussed: from simple gases, liquids and solids, through man-made dyes, drugs and plastics, all the way to the molecules of living things. We will start from just a couple of basic physical laws, then explore the interactions between matter and energy which allow us to answer complex questions such as: How do medicines work? What makes our world so colourful? Where can I make my own measurements? We will do lab experiments and employ a number of sophisticated instruments to gain an even deeper understanding of the molecular world.",
