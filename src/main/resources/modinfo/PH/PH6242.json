    "description": "This module will explore in depth some advanced topics in philosophy of language. Possible topics are the nature of truth, Dummettian anti\u2010realism, contextualism, relativism, or two\u2010dimensionalism. We may also consider the application of philosophy of language to issues in other areas of philosophy, such as the debate between cognitivists and noncognitivists in metaethics, or the question of whether metaphysical disputes are merely verbal.",
