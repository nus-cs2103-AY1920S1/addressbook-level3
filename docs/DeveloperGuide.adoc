== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `deletestudent 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `AssignmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Handles the History feature

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `NotebookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletestudent 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletestudent 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Notebook data.
* saves the state of the Notebook after each change in state for undo redo function.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Classroom>`, `ObservableList<Student>`, `ObservableList<Assignment>`, and `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Classroom`, which `Student` can reference. This would allow `Classroom` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]
// end::model[]

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Notebook data in json format and read it back.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete feature

==== Current Implementation

The AutoComplete feature is facilitated by 2 classes: the `AutoCompleteTextField`, and the class `Styles`.
Both are represented in the class diagram below.

image::SebastianDG/AutoCompleteClassDiagram.png[auto_,300,300,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

The `AutoCompleteTextField` adds a `ChangeListener` to textProperty() that notifies `AutoCompleteTextField`
whenever the user inputs new text, i.e when the text entered changes.

Step 1.  User triggers the listener when user enters text.

Step 2. From the text entered, `AutoCompleteTextField` attempts suggesting existing commands.
If input matches any existing commands, it proceeds to step 3. Otherwise, it does nothing and waits for user input.

Step 3. `AutoCompleteTextField` calls `Styles#buildTextFlow`to highlight the portion of each
command suggestion where the user's input matches the suggestion.

Step 4. `AutoCompleteTextField` then displays a popup menu using the javafx class `ContextMenu`.

Step 5. If the user selects a suggestion, the textfield is set to that suggestion, and the popup menu is
closed. If the user enters more text, `AutoCompleteTextField` returns to step 1.

Step 6. Otherwise, the popup menu is closed.

This sequence of steps is illustrated below with an activity diagram.

image::SebastianDG/auto_activity.JPG[auto_,500,500,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::upload[]
=== Upload feature

==== Current Implementation

The uploading of a student's picture is facilitated by UploadPictureCommandParser, UploadPictureCommand, ModelManager, FileChooser and DisplayPicture,
while the displaying of the student's picture is facilitated by MainWindow and StudentCard. +
`UploadPictureCommandParser` implements `Parser`. `UploadPictureCommand` extends `Command`,
and represents the logic that will be executed once the user activates the upload command and chooses a file. +
The `UploadPictureCommand` command communicates with `ModelManager` to replace the old `Student` object with
a new `Student` object that has its display picture field changed. +

This change is then reflected in the UI when `MainWindow` loads the `StudentCard` for the new student,
which will load the image and display it in the UI.

The main operation implemented is `UploadPictureCommand#execute`.

Step 1. The user wants to upload a display picture for their student. User identifies the student's index
number and enters the command `upload INDEX`.

Step 2. `MainWindow` detects the `upload` command word and uses `FileChooser` to open a window for the user to select a picture from their computer.
`MainWindow` then saves the path of the selected file as a string and adds a prefix "f/" to the input arguments.
The path of the file is also appended to the end of the input string before the input arguments are passed to `NotebookParser`

Step 3. `NotebookParser` parses the input and detects the `upload` command word, and calls `UploadPictureCommandParser`.
This in turn checks user's input for errors before calling `UploadPictureCommand`, which checks whether the file
is a PNG or JPG file.

Step 4. `LogicManager` executes the `UploadPictureCommand`, which checks the validity of the index provided,
as well as whether the picture selected is different from the picture already displayed.
A visual representation of the order of checks for the input arguments are displayed in the diagram below.

image::upload/upload_dg_1.JPG[checksdiagram,400,480,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

Step 5. After these checks, the `createEditedStudent` method in `UploadPictureCommand` is called to create a new `Student` object, editedStudent,
which has its display filepath changed to the file the user chose.

Step 6. `UploadPictureCommand` calls Model to replace the current student with the editedStudent.
The command result is then passed back all the way to `MainWindow` which refreshes the GUI,
and displays the new picture for the chosen student.

The following diagram illustrates the process above.

image::SebastianDG/UploadSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::upload[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo and Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `Caretaker`, with each notebook state saved as a `Memento`.
It extends `Notebook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `mementos` and `statePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Caretaker#saveState()` -- Saves the current notebook state in its history.
* `Caretaker#undo()` -- Restores the previous notebook state from its history by undoing the previous command.
* `Caretaker#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone notebook state from its history by redoing the previously undone command.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveState()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Caretaker` will be initialized with the initial notebook state, and the `statePointer` pointing to that single notebook state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `deletestudent 5` command to delete the 5th student in the current classroom. The `deletestudent` command calls `Model#saveState()`, causing the modified state of the notebook after the `deletestudent 5` command executes to be saved in the `mementos`, and the `statePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted notebook state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `addstudent n/David ...` to add a new student. The `addstudent` command also calls `Model#saveState()`, causing another modified notebook state to be saved into the `mementos`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveState()`, so the notebook state will not be saved into the `mementos`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `statePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous notebook state, and restores the notebook to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `statePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial notebook state, then there are no previous notebook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `statePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the notebook to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `statePointer` is at index `mementos.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest notebook state, then there are no undone notebook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `liststudents`. Commands that do not modify the classroom, such as `liststudents`, will usually not call `Model#saveState()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `mementos` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveState()`. Since the `statePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `mementos`, all notebook states after the `statePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `addstudent n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.


image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire notebook.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletestudent`, just save the student being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
** Cons: Need to ensure that the commands are able to be executed at the correct index.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of notebook states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `Caretaker`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::Assignment[]
=== Assignment feature
==== Implementation
The Assignment class works with high similarity to the Student Class implemented.
A UniqueList of Assignments exist in the Classroom Class alongside the UniqueList of Students, and serve to keep track of assignments for a particular Classroom.
The commands that work in similar fashion to Student Class are: +
`AddAssignment`, `DeleteAssignment`, `EditAssignment`, `ListAssignment`

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `UniqueAssignmentList#addAssignment()` -- Adds a new Assignment object to the UniqueAssignmentList.
* `UniqueAssigmentList#remove()` -- Removes a Lesson object from the UniqueAssignmentList.
* `UniqueAssignmentList#setAssignment()` -- Updates the Assignment with user input.


The Assignment class keeps track of the grades of all students in the class for a particular assignment. This feature is
necessary to users to monitor the progress of every student, and to provide assistance to students who might be
failing their tests.
Each Assignment contains the following classes: AssignmentName, AssignmentGrade, and AssignmentDeadline.

* The AssignmentName stores the name of the assignment.

* The AssignmentGrade class contains the grades of every student in the class through a LinkedHashMap<String studentName, String marks>.

* The AssignmentDeadline class contains the time when the assignment is due.

Upon creation of a new Assignment, `Assignment#initialiseGrades()` is called, which populates the LinkedHashMap
with keys (students' names) and the value "Not Submitted". The user can then update the grades of a student individually or
all of the students simultaneously through the `UpdateGrades` command, which calls the method `Assignment#setGrades()`.

After every command, `Assignment#checkCompletion()` is called to determine the completion status of the assignment,
which will be "Completed" if none of the grades are "Not Submitted". Upon addition of a new student into the classroom,
each Assignment present in the classroom will add another entry into the AssignmentGrade. If the Assignment was Not Completed,
the value "Not Submitted" will be paired with the key through the method `Assignment#addNewStudentGrade`. Should the Assignment have been Completed, the value "Late to the party" will be paired instead through the method `Assignment#addOneStudentGrade`, indicating that the student does not need to submit said assignment any longer, since it has already been graded before he/she joined the classroom.

// end::Assignment[]

// tag::getgrades[]
=== Get grades feature
==== Implementation

The current GetStudentGradesCommand will retrieve all the grades of a particular student.
This is done through iterating through the FilteredAssignmentList, and pulling all the grades of a specified student.
Additionally, it implements the following operations through Commands:

* `Assignment#getGrades()` -- Retrieves the Map that contains students' names as the key and students' grades as the value.

The following sequence diagram shows how the get grades operation works:

image::GetGradesSequenceDiagram.png[]

After getting the Map from the `getGrades()` method, if the key of the current key-value pair is equals to the name of the student,
the value, which is the grades of the student, will be added to the output that will be shown in the CommandResult.

// end::getgrades[]

// tag::getunsubmitted[]
=== Get unsubmitted assignments feature
==== Implementation

The implementation for getting unsubmitted assignments is similar to the get submitted feature, except that it will search for values of "Not submitted." instead.

The following activity diagram shows how the get unsubmitted operation works:

image::GetUnsubmittedActivityDiagram.png[]

// end::getunsubmitted[]

// tag::Lesson[]
=== Lesson Feature
==== Implementation

The Lesson class works with high similarity to the Student Class implemented.
A UniqueList of Lessons exist in the Notebook alongside the UniqueList of Classrooms, and serve to keep track of lessons for the user.
Additionally, it implements the following operations through Commands:

* `UniqueLessonList#addLesson()` -- Adds a new Lesson object to the UniqueLessonList.
* `UniqueLessonList#remove()` -- Removes a Lesson object from the UniqueLessonList.
* `Lesson#set()` -- Updates the Lesson with user input.

// end::Lesson[]

// tag::Schedule[]
=== Scheduling Feature
==== Implementation
When a new Lesson is added to the UniqueLessonList, a listener attached to the list will be triggered and it will create a scheduler to schedule the lesson.
Once the timing of lesson is reached, an alert box will be created in the GUI to serve as a reminder.

The following activity and sequence diagram shows how the scheduling operation works:

image::SchedulingActivityDiagram.png[]

image::SchedulingSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::Schedule[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Run the jar file on the command line by typing `java -jar teachersnotebook.jar`. +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by typing `java -jar teachersnotebook.jar` in the command line. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a student

. Deleting a student while all students are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all students using the `liststudents` command. Multiple students in the list.
.. Test case: `deletestudent 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `deletestudent 0` +
   Expected: No student is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deletestudent`, `deletestudent x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Undo / Redo

. Undoing a command that was previously done, and redoing it after.

.. Prerequisites: A command that changes the state of the notebook should be executed (e.g. add / edit / delete).
.. Test case (assume a student was added in the previous command execution): `undo` +
   Expected: The previously added student will now be removed. Command result will show the message 'Undo success!". Student panel will show that the student is no longer in the list.
.. Test case (assume the only previous command was `listassignments`): `undo` +
   Expected: There will be undo command executed. Reason is because there is no change in the state of the notebook. Command result will show the message 'There is no action to undo!'.
.. Test case (assume a student was added in the previous command execution): `undo`, followed by `redo` +
   Expected: When undo is executed, student will be removed from the list just like in test case 1.
   When redo is executed, the student that was previously removed will now be added back again. Command result will show the message 'Redo success!'. Student panel will show that the student is now back in the list.
.. Other incorrect undo / redo commands to try: `undo x`, `redo x`, `undoes`, `redoes`

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. If the data file is missing, the application will simply start from a new notebook that is populated with several data size. User can use the command `clear` to get an empty notebook. +
   Expected: New notebook with populated data.
.. If the data file is corrupted, users should delete the notebook.json file and restart from a new notebook. It may be tough to rectify the json file without knowing the internal structure of the application. +
   Expected: New notebook with populated data.
