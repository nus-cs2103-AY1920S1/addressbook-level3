    "description": "Freshwater is essential to life, yet constitutes less than 3% of Earth\u2019s total water. With many freshwater ecosystems under threat, understanding the biology of freshwaters is fundamentally important to their management, conservation and restoration. This module introduces the study of inland waters, with emphasis on aquatic ecology, structure and function, and aquatic conservation. Topics discussed will include diversity and ecology of freshwater habitats and aquatic organisms, and aquatic conservation issues including policies, regulation and management of freshwater resources in local and international contexts.",
