    "description": "The module introduces the basic concepts in search and knowledge representation as well as to a number of sub-areas of artificial intelligence. It focuses on covering the essential concepts in AI. The module covers Turing test, blind search, iterative deepening, production systems, heuristic search, A* algorithm, minimax and alpha-beta procedures, predicate and first-order logic, resolution refutation, non-monotonic reasoning, assumption-based truth maintenance systems, inheritance hierarchies, the frame problem, certainly factors, Bayes' rule, frames and semantic nets, planning, learning, natural language, vision, and expert systems and LISP.",
