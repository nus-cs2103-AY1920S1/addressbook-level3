== Introduction

CaloFit is suitable for those who prefer to track their calories gained from day-to-day meals. CaloFit is primarily uses a Command Line Interface(CLI) while still displaying the results through a Graphical User Interface(GUI). You can set your daily calorie target and CaloFit will do its best to help you stay on track.

As of our latest version, v1.4. CaloFit would be able to run on all computers, be it Windows, Mac, Linux and more!

Currently our product would be able to let you set a desired calorie budget, track your meals, provide assistance to keep you on track, last but not least a monthly report will be provided for you!

== About

This user guide provides the user a simple yet useful utility guide on how CaloFit operates.

There will be very minimal prior technical knowledge that the user would need to have in order to use Calofit.



== Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.

2. Go to our [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-4/main/releases[GitHub Releases page]] and find our latest release! An example is shown in the picture below.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[UIOverview]]
== UI Overview

This section covers the various parts of the CaloFit user interface.

=== Command Box

image::command_bar.png[]
The command box is the main means of interacting with CaloFit.
Users can enter commands, as detailed in <<Commands>>, in order to work with the app.

To submit a command, the user can press the `Enter` key.
The application will parse and evaluate the command.
Any further feedback from the command will be displayed in the feedback box below.

image::command_bar_err.png[]
If any error is encountered, the command text will not be cleared, and turn red.

=== Budget Bar
image::budgetbar_partial.png[]

The budget bar shows a visual overview of the meals the user has consumed today.
Each meal displayed in the budget bar is proportionately sized to its calories,
and is labelled by its dish name.
Additionally, a white buffer segment is shown, representing the remaining amount of calories availablee today.

The [yellow]#yellow# mark indicates the current budget limit,
while the [red]#red# mark indicates 120% of the current budget limit.
This gives you a visual overview as to how much more the user can consume for today,
and give a margin of error even when exceeding the budget.


When the total calorie count of meals today exceeds even the 120% mark, the bar will not show a buffer segment.
Instead, the meals will occupy the entire width of the bar, remaining proportionate to their calorie counts.
The budget marks will also move to the appropriate positions, still representing 100% and 120% of the budget.

_Coming in v2.0:_
When a meal's bar segment is too small, its dish name will be hidden.
Information on the dish still can be viewed as a tooltip, when hovering over the segment.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/<<mealname_syntax, MEAL_NAME>>`, `<<mealname_syntax, MEAL_NAME>>` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Carbonara`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `add n/<<mealname_syntax, MEAL_NAME>> [c/<<calories_syntax, CALORIES>>]` can be used as `add n/Carbonara c/430` or as `add n/Carbonara`.

=== Meal Tracking

==== Adding a meal: `add`

Adds a meal that the user ate to be tracked by CaloFit. +
There are 2 formats that can be used: +

Format 1: `add n/<<mealname_syntax, MEAL_NAME>> [c/<<calories_syntax, CALORIES>>] [t/TAGS]` +
Inputting calories of the meal is optional. +
If the meal is a dish stored in CaloFit, the calories will be taken from CaloFit. If not, a default value of 700 will be added for you, +
Tags are completely optional and there is no default tag. You could also have more than 1 tag. +

Format 2: `add NUMBER_IN_SUGGESTED_MEAL_LIST [NUMBER_IN_SUGGESTED_MEAL_LIST] ...` +

You can also add multiple meals at one go using the indexes. This can be done by separating the numbers with a space.
e.g. `add 1 2 3`

[NOTE]
<<mealname_syntax, MEAL_NAME>> can only be a maximum of 30 characters to ensure it displays correctly for you.

Examples usage: +

image::AddCommandAddedFormat1.png[]

* If CaloFit does not have the information, and the information is not provided,
the default calorie information will be 700 calories

A mix of the different fields is possible as well.

Examples:

* `edit 1 n/Wanton Noodle c/1000`

Example usage:
You're tired from work and you don't want to think about what to eat for the day, you just want to have a meal to keep yourself full and stay within the calorie budget that you want set for yourself.

image::ReportCommandError.png[]
{empty} +

Your report will display the following statistical data for you to monitor your own progress!:

1. Your Maximum, Minimum and Average calorie intake per day of the current month.
[NOTE]
Average value is rounded. +
Average value is calculated by totalling your calorie intake in that month so far and dividing it by the total number of days in that month, *NOT* the number of days that have passed in that month so far.
2. The number of days where calorie intake exceeded calorie budget of the month.
3. Your list of most consumed dishes of the month.
4. Your calorie intake per day over the entire month.
5. The quantity of each type of dish consumed in that month.

Below is a picture of the report showing where each type of information mentioned above can be found, corresponding to their number.
