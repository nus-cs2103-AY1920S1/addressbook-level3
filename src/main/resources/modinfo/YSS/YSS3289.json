    "description": "International relations scholars have traditionally studied the interactions between sovereign states interacting within an anarchic international system. In the post-World War II era, interstate relationships have become less ad-hoc, and considerably more institutionalized, with a large number of international organizations\u2014such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the European Union, the IMF, and the World Bank\u2014emerging to oversee these institutionalized patterns of cooperation. This course will consider why IOs have grown in importance and how they work. It will also consider their relationships with state and non-governmental actors, and their impact on political and policy outcomes.",
