    "description": "This module immerses students in the economic history of Penang, and by extension, the Straits Settlements. We consider how political conflicts across the globe centuries ago explain the diaspora in Penang today. We examine the lives of different linguistic, religious, and political communities \u2014 Malays, Chinese, Chulia, Armenians, Sephardi Jews, and British \u2014 as well as the birth of hybrid identities \u2014 Baba Nyonya, Jawi Peranakan, and Eurasians. We explore how globalization enabled a few immigrants to go from rags to riches. We observe the different players \u2014 merchants, coolies, and bureaucrats. We study the interaction and evolution of labor, capital, and technology.",
