== Introduction

Liberry is a desktop app for librarians to *quickly manage their community libraries!* Liberry is optimized for librarians who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). You can type quickly and serve your long line of borrowers in a short amount of time. Liberry can manage all your books and borrowers efficiently and meticulously. Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started now! Enjoy!
