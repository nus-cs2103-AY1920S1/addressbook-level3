    "description": "This module introduces students to some of the major themes of comparative political sociology through the lens of a clearly established literature that draws from a variety of national and subnational case studies. It focuses on the relationship between civil society and the state and on the institutions and processes that mediate that relationship. Topics covered include contemporary theories of the modern state; political culture and civil society; revolutionary and non-revolutionary political regime change; clientelism; and corporatist and non-corporatist forms of interest group intermediation.",
