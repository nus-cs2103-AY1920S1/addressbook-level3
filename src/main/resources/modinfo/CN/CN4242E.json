    "description": "Students will learn the basic theories, methods and software for formulating and solving optimization problems relevant to chemical processes. They will study various methods of linear, nonlinear and mixed-integer linear programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization by solving selected practical problems via various case studies as well as a term project. This is for undergraduate students who wish to learn optimization methodology to solve real-life problems in research and chemical industry.",
