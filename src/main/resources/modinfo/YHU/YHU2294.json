    "description": "Using short stories, novellas, TV shows and films, this class examines the art of detective writing and traces the narrative complicity of the detective and urban space. The detective moves between different social spaces within the city, with access to both penthouses and crack dens, and the city itself becomes a character in these tales \u2013 alternatively helpful, seductive, sullen, and dangerous. Part of the syllabus will be dedicated to texts originating in the Global South, asking how the genre of detective fiction changes when it encounters the postcolonial city.",
