Hi! My name is Wei Gen.

I am currently a second year student in NUS School of Computing, pursuing a Bachelor of Computing (Honours).

This portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of FinSec, which is a project
that my team and I completed for the module CS2103T. This project has definitely been greatly beneficial to my own
learning and self-development in becoming a more competent software engineer.

== PROJECT: FinSec

== Overview

FinSec is a useful application that was created with the end goal of aiding Financial Secretaries of any organisation.
It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based tool to cater to computing professionals who are highly adept at typing but
also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interface for users to easily view interact with FinSec.

FinSec boasts relevant and useful features which have been carefully selected and scrutinised to fit the needs of our
target audience. All of FinSec's features and implementations are well documented in guides for users and developers
respectively.

== Role

My main role was to act as the Team Lead for the project, completing team tasks for the project and managing
general tasks for the team members. As I was the only one who has been in the position of our target audience, I
can best understand their user requirements, so I was also the one to set the directions of the project.

Development-wise, I also developed the Claims feature _(including logic, storage and model)_, as well as adding the
association between Claims and Contacts. I also created the documentation and tests that came along with the features.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Claim feature*
** *What it does*: This feature allows users, who are mainly Financial Secretaries, to enter Claims into
the FinSec application and track their claim entries.
** *Justification*: The `Claim feature` is a vital feature to the FinSec application since that the majority of
organisations and clubs have claims to keep track of. It allows Financial Secretaries to keep proper records of the
organisation and to keep track of its financial status.
** *Implementation*: The Person class in Address Book 3 (AB3) is remodelled to resemble a claim entry _(with additional
attributes of ID, Description, Amount, Date and Status)_.
** *Highlights*: The implementation of this feature is fairly manageable since that it is an adaptation of the Person
class. However, there is much more coupling compared to the Person class, thus it is more complex. There are also more
stringent testing required, such as `Date` parsing.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the *Approve and Reject Claim features*
** *What it does*: This feature allows users to approve or reject pending claims.
** *Justification*: Claims can have different statuses, and `Budget` will behave differently depending on their
statuses.
** *Implementation*: ApproveClaimCommand and RejectClaimCommand will check whether the claim chosen is a PendingClaim,
and only if it is can its status be approved or rejected respectively.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the *association between Claims and Contacts*
** *What it does*: Adding a claim into the app's list of claims will add the claim into the associated contact's list
of claims as well.
** *Justification*: Each claim added is associated to a contact. The user will be able to view all the claims associated
to a contact when viewing them using the CheckCommand.
** *Implementation*: During the execution of the AddClaimCommand, it checks the FinSec if there is a contact with the
entered name. Only if there is an existing contact for the claim will the command be executed. It also adds
the Claim ID to the contact's list of claims to keep track of each contact's claim.
** *Highlights*: I have also added a table to the IndividualContactWindow for the user to view the details of every
claim of each contact easily.
