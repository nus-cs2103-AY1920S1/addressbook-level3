Hi! My name is Caesar Pang. I'm currently a second year SoC (School of Computing) student in NUS majoring in Computer Science.

This portfolio page aims to document the contributions I have made in the development of TutorAid, which is a project that my team and I completed for the module CS2103T. This project has definitely been greatly beneficial to my own learning and self-development in becoming a more competent software engineer.

== PROJECT: TutorAid

== Overview

TutorAid is a handy application that was created for tutors and teaching assistants in NUS School of Computing to help improve their workflow and save time by better organizing all the information they require in one central location. It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based tool to cater to computing professionals who are highly adept at typing but also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interface for users to easily view and interact with TutorAid.

TutorAid boasts well thought out features which have been carefully selected and reviewed to fit the exact needs of our target audience. All of TutorAid's features and implementations are well documented in guides for users and developers respectively.

== Role

My main role was to prototype and develop the Login feature and the Earnings Tracker feature.
The login command required me to think of how to put up a login window that only shows the main window when the user
has logged in successfully. It also required me to think of how to encrypt the passwords stored and how to check whether they
 are valid as well. I also did the Earning feature where it tracks what earnings you have earned throughout the weeks. It has a claim status that
allows you to see if you have claimed your earnings from your respective faculties.

== Summary of contributions

* *Largest enhancement*: Auto addition of earnings.
** What it does: It allows the user to auto add all of the earnings of the day (provided that the earnings is a routine), into the earnings list with only one short `auto` command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as a Tutor, it is normal to have tutorials or labs or consultations to give
at the same day of the week, every week. If a tutor, for example, has many lessons in a day to teach, he/she has to add the earnings into the list one by one, which is
extremely hard and tedious to do. If the tutor has added the earnings into the list once already, the tutor can repeat this earnings by invoking the `weekly_earnings` command and the
number of times to add into the list. Afterwards, the tutor just has to invoke the `auto` command on the day itself to auto add all his routine lessons.
** Implementation: This enhancement alters how TutorAid is used. Instead of just being a normal, "key in earnings" tracker, the addition of such a feature has helped to
ease the use of earnings tracking for the users. This is facilitated by the use of a HashMap in the Earnings list. This HashMap only has at most 7 keys as these keys are
determined by the name of the days in a week. Inside the HashMap, there are ArrayList mapped as the values of the HashMap. This feature consists of 2 main commands. The first command is `weekly_earnings INDEX count/COUNT` and the second command is `auto`. Users have to add the earnings that they want to repeat over the weeks manually first. After they have added the earnings, they can invoke the `weekly_earnings` command to auto add the earnings for the next few weeks depending on the number of counts they have inputted. The `weekly_earnings` command add the key-value pair to a HashMap in `Earnings` class. Once the user invokes the `auto` command, the parser will check the current day of the week and
get the value of the HashMap that is associated with the key value (that is the day of the week). If there exists an ArrayList, the parser will check through the entire list and
check if the Earnings in the ArrayList has more than a `Count` of 0. If the `Count` is more than zero, then the parser adds the `Earnings` object into the current list. If the `Count` is zero, the `Earnings object would be removed from the ArrayList.
