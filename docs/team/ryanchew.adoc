== PROJECT: CaloFit

---

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic desktop addressbook application(AddressBook - Level 3) for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph
it into a calorie tracker cum food database system called CaloFit. This enhanced application allows health-conscious people or those who are aiming for a diet to set their calorie budget for the day; manage the meals that they take; find dishes based on keywords or their remaining calorie budget; and get data about their calorie intake progress through a report.

CaloFit is a desktop application for tracking the calories that the user has taken from his or her meals over the course of using the application. +
The user interacts with CaloFit using a Command Line Interface(CLI) that is represented by a box near the top of the application screen. This is where the user can type in their commands and press "Enter" on their keyboards to execute them. +
It has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX. The GUI is the main display that the user sees upon starting up CaloFit.

This is what our project looks like as shown in Figure 1 below:

My roles were to handle the backend refactoring to morph the application, and to do the budget-related features.
In the following sections, I will cover those changes and features, together with the relevant updates to
the user and developer guides.

This symbol indicates important information.

`report` A grey highlight(called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

* *Major enhancement*: added a *budget bar display*.
** What it does:
Visually displays the user's meals eaten today, as a progress-like bar. Each segment corresponds to one meal, and is sized accordingly.
** Justification:
This feature gives immediate visual feedback to users, of the meals they have eaten today, and how much more they can eat.
** Highlights:
The bar display is the most obvious user-facing result of the model refactoring process.
** Credits:
The [https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx[ControlsFX library]] was used to provide the display of the segmented progress bar.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a *`set` command to control total budget*.
** What it does: This commandd allows the user to customize and set their (expected) daily calorie intake.
** Justification: This allows each user to tailor the app for their own diet plans.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *saving of the user's historical calorie budget data to a JSON (Javascript Object Notation) file*.
** What it does: The user's historical calorie budget data into CaloFit will be saved into a JSON file, allowing the user's calorie budget history to be loaded upon starting up CaloFit.
** Justification: This feature is necessary to preserve the user's past and current calorie budget/limit, both to reference in the budget bar, and be tracked in the statistics.
** Credits: The methods and structure of converting a Class into a JSON file was taken from the original AddressBook-Level 3 and refactored for the purpose mentioned above.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=iltep64&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=FelixNWJ&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Functional code]]

* *Other contributions*:


** Project management:
*** In charge of overall software architecture
**** Refactored original AddressBook model structure, into something closer to our problem domain.
**** Provided many low-level code infrastructure to support teammates' high-level features.

** Community:
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (https://github.com/iltep64/ped/issues[List of bugs reported])
** Tools:
*** Introduced [https://site.mockito.org/[Mockito]], a mocking library to help test implementation.

== Contributions to the User Guide

With the new purpose of the app, we had to change the AB3 user guide,
with customized instructions for our application.
The following are excerpts from our *CaloFit User Guide*.
They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users.
