    "description": "Our courts have to determine the appropriate punishment/sentence for every offender who has been found guilty. Thus, sentencing law and practice is an area of law that affects the lives of every offender who goes through our criminal justice process. But what are the numerous considerations going into the calculus of what is the most appropriate punishment for an offender? This course will cover, among other things, the theoretical and empirical perspectives of punishment, sentencing options, sentencing methodology, and key aggravating and mitigating factors. We will also cover other important sentencing issues such as consecutive vs concurrent sentence, and parity.",
