== PROJECT: Modulo

---

== Overview

Modulo is a NUS student life application specially designed for busy and motivated NUS students.

As busy students in NUS, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various tasks and concurrently do well for exams. Modulo features a one-stop application to keep track of one's timetable, finances and academic progress. It also includes a quiz feature that facilitates students with actively recalling their study concepts to improve their study outcomes.

The user interacts with Modulo using a CLI, and it features an outstanding user-friendly GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 35 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: create *calendar* feature
** What it does: allows the user to manage their tasks and classes in a weekly calendar view.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because our targeted user, which are NUS students, needed a
fast and convenient way to manage all of their tasks.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and needs to be supported by change of the graphical user interface.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
