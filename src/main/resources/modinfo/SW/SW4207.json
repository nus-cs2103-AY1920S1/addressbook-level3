    "description": "This module examines social demographic changes in Singapore society and their impact on social structure and life course manifestations. Dynamics of social demographic changes will be examined and these include population ageing, fertility, marriage, mortality, and migration. The elongation of life span, the persistent below replacement fertility, and the inflow of migrants are some of the important issues with profound implications for Singapore society. The module will focus on local population situations and address social and welfare policy implications arising from social structural and life courses changes.",
