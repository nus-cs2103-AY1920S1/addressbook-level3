== PROJECT: ɯeme

---

== Overview

ɯeme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, ɯeme is optimized for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users can view, tag, search, import and export a collection of meme. They can also create their own memes from meme templates.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *statistics for Weme*
** What it does: In Memes panel, it allows user to like and dislike a meme.
This data is used in statistics panel where data like per tag and dislike per tag are displayed in pie chart form.
** Justification: This feature is commonly seen on online meme sites and social media platform that supports image posting.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires understanding of the program from frontend to backend as
the statistics data is stored in a similar fashion as the memes. As such, an understanding of json files
and JavaFX is required.
** Credits: AddressBook 3 implementation gave rise to the infrastructure of the statistics feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: created wrapper class ImagePath during morphing stage for internal use. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-3/main/pull/38[#38]
