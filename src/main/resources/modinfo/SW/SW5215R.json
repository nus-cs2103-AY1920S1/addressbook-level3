This course examines theories of saving and asset accumulation, in particular, institutional saving theory for inclusive asset\u2010building policy in Singapore and other parts of the world. To increase understanding of asset\u2010building strategies, this course provides a range of asset\u2010building policy and programs throughout the world. Students are also expected to develop new asset\u2010building programs for the vulnerable groups in Singapore.",
