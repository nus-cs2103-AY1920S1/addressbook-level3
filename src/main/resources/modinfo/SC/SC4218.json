    "description": "This module is designed to develop a nuanced understanding of forms of religiosity in the present. One aim of the module is to explore connections between the realms of religion and politics, particularly within the framework of secular states. The module examines the notions of \u2018secularity\u2019 and \u2018post\u2010secularity\u2019 and queries their relevance for the contemporary moment, within a comparative, historical perspective. Is it useful to invoke the concept of \u2018secularism\u2019 to make sense of encounters between religious and political domains? Do the ideas of the \u2018separation of church and state\u2019 and \u2018state non-interference in religion\u2019 help in these efforts?",
