    "description": "Many of the world\u2019s problems are linked to population changes: rapidly aging population, immigration woes, and the threat of environmental degradation to human existence. In this module, students will be introduced to population trends and be equipped to better understand fertility, mortality and migration and how they cause changes in population size, composition and distribution. It incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics. Students will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios.",
