    "description": "What does it mean to be different in Japan today? What kind of difference matters in Japan? How do certain people come to be treated differently? This module answers these important questions by shining a spotlight on the biographies of individuals intimately connected to Japan who through choice and circumstance have come to lead extraordinary lives. The module, through analysis of numerous life histories and a range of theories that help us understand them, offers insights into the nature of cultural homogenization and social differentiation and the particular ways these processes are defined and reinforced in the Japanese context.",
