    "description": "Using the European Union and ASEAN as examples, we will study the opportunities and challenges posed by regional (economic) integration. In particular, we examine the EU\u2019s institutional setup, its core policies, and its place on the international stage as the largest common market in the world. We will compare and contrast the EU's experience with that of ASEAN to see what conclusions can be drawn on the prospects of regional integration.",
