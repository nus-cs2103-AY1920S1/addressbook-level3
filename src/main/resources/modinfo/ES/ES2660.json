    "description": "In a context of prolific production and convenient access to content and innovation in the Information Age, how should one critically process and clearly communicate ideas to various audiences? In this module, students will learn to question and articulate their analysis of assumptions and assertions on issues facing the Information Age through processes such as identifying bias and substantiating arguments. The Ennis\u2019 (1986, 2001) taxonomy of critical thinking dispositions will be employed to develop students\u2019 analytical thinking skills and their ability to articulate cogent responses to arguments or to defend their own positions in both written and oral form.",
