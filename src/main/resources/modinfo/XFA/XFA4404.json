It aims to provide students with the opportunity of exploring the meeting points of their two disciplines. It will be jointly supervised by faculty members from both faculties. Students intending to read this module are expected to consult prospective supervisors the semester before they read this module and provide a research proposal. A wide range of topics is acceptable provided it highlights a language issue.",
