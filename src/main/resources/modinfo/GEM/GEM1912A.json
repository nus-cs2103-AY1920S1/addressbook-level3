    "description": "The late Steve Jobs, former CEO of the Apple company, has been credited with \u2018humanising technology\u2019: recognising that technology design needs to be sensitive to human characteristics. In this Junior Seminar, students will be exploring various ways of thinking about the relationship between the \u2018technical\u2019 and the \u2018human\u2019. What can these tell us about the organization of social life, and how (if at all) do they contribute to the design of \u2018better\u2019 technologies? A central role will be reserved for ethnographic studies of technology\u2010in\u2010use \u2013 an academic approach that has gained traction with industry over the past decades. Students will also acquire hands\u2010on experience of this approach by studying technology\u2010in\u2010use among friends, in the home, in the College/University, or workplace.",
