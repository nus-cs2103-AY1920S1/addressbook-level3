    "description": "This module offers a critical excursion into social theory from the perspective of the \u201cglobal south,\u201d broadly conceived; that is, theory which questions the orthodoxies arising from the modernist, EuroAmerican social sciences. It explores foundational concepts by estranging them: among others, personhood, liberalism and neoliberalism, democracy, modernity, the nation and its borders, civil society, sovereignty, history, crime and social order. Taking Africa as one of its exemplary contexts, it will explore and evaluate some of the critiques levelled by non-western scholars at \u201cclassical\u201d wisdom, its relationship to colonialism and empire, and the rise of industrial capitalism.",
