    "description": "This research seminar aims to challenge the nationcentered approach of treating China as a coherent unit of historical analysis and provide students with a more complex understanding of Chinese history by focusing on the history of specific localities. We will select a locality each semester for conducting an indepth analysis of its social, economic, and cultural developments in history and will attempt to answer broader historical questions based on the findings.",
