    "description": "This module begins with the examination of various strands of liberalism, including liberal versions of communitarianism, and then proceeds on that basis to survey various significant reactions to liberalism. In addition to communism and fascism, the module will also examine the ideological challenges to liberalism from radical/militant Islamism and the advocates of so-called \"Asian values\". This is an introductory module and is designed for any beginning student with an interest in the theoretical approach to the study of competing political belief systems.",
