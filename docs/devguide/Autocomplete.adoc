=== Overview Of Implementation
The auto-complete mechanism extends NurseTraverse with 3 functionalities +

- Completing word in command box
- Suggesting of words that are compatible with previous sub-commands
- Guide for user to select from the various sub-commands +

*Given below is an example usage scenario of autocompletion* +

Step 1:
When the user launches the application, an instance of the object, command and prefix autocomplete word list will be initialised in `AutoCompleteStorage`, which implements the following operations:

* `AutoCompleteWordStorage#getOListAllCommandWord()` — returns the observable list of command words stored
* `AutoCompleteWordStorage#getOListAllPrefixWord()` — returns the observable list of prefix words stored
* `AutoCompleteWordStorage#getOListAllObjectWord()` — returns the observable list of object words stored
* `AutoCompleteWordStorage#generateOListAllIndexWord(String objectName)` — generate an observable list of index words corresponding to previous object word when called

The auto-complete panel will be set to object list when user first start the application.

Step 2: Whenever user types a key in the command line, `CommandBox` will notify `AutoCompletePanelManager` to perform changes based on userinput

This will update the number of matched words with the current list and 3 sets of algorithms will be run +

- `AutoCompleteListHandler#chooseList()` +
-> Based on the number of matched words(pre-processed in the `AutoCompletePanelManager`) +
-> List will be chosen from `AutoCompleteStorage`

- `AutoCompleteListHandler#filterList()` +
-> The chosen list will then be filter to only words that are compatible with previous correctly typed full words. +
-> This is done by iterating through all the matched word and checking if `AutoCompleteWord` has a list of associated words +
-> If the `AutoCompleteWord` has a list of associated words, this method will attempt to match the associated words with the matched words while filter out all incompatible words in the chosen list in the process  +
(Eg: prefix list will be filtered to only be compatible with “pat-add” user command, the words that come before prefix.)

- `AutoCompleteListHandler#updateList()` +
-> Update the filtered list to fit the last partially typed word +
-> The last partially typed word in `CommandBox` will be checked against the filtered list +
-> If the word in the filter list does not start with the last partially typed word, it will be filtered out +
(Eg: User typed “pat-ad”. “add” and “add-medcon” which are both in the current list will be suggested since they both starts with "ad".)

The following sequence and activity diagrams illustrates the general flow when user input is detected +

=== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Communication between `UiPart` s +
(`CommandBox`, `AutoCompletePanel` and `ResultDisplay`) +

* **Alternative 1:** Pass references of each UiParts components around
** Pros: Simpler to call methods as required, code will be easier to understand and implementation will take less effort
** Cons: Code will be harder to track since any component with reference to the UiPart can manipulate its property

* **Alternative 2(current choice):** Implement facades and observer patterns
** Pros: Code is easier to maintain
** Cons: Less readability

=== Logic Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Method to suggest auto-complete words

* **Alternative 1:** Have several lists. First word list, Second word list, etc
** Pros: Minimal effort in parsing of command line input.
** Cons: Auto-complete panel will be unorganised. Eg: both index 1 and prefix may be suggested instead of just all index or all prefix suggested.

* **Alternative 2:** Suggest full commands such as pat-edit 2 n/ t/ .. and omit any list
** Pros: Easy to implement. No parsing required.
** Cons: Auto-complete panel will be chunky as all commands are suggested at the same time. User will not be guided in selecting which command to choose.

* **Alternative 3(current choice):** Have several lists. Object/Command/Index/Prefix lists.
** Pros: User will be guided. Very user friendly. Panel will be more organised as words are suggested in sets of the same type.
** Cons: Parsing of command line input can be tedious.

=== UI Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Location of autocomplete panel

* **Alternative 1:** Place it as a floating window
** Pros: User is able to resize and can be moved around easily
** Cons: A floating window may block out some of the UI of the application, and user will have to re-place the autocomplete panel every time the application starts

* **Alternative 2(current choice):** Fix it permanently at a pre-set location
** Pros: Simpler and user will get use to the its location easier since it is pre-set
** Cons: Less customisable for user
