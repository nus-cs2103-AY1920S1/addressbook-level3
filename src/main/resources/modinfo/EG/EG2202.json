It bridges the design thinking process taught in the prerequisite module into the engineering design process, equipping the students with understanding and knowledge of translating conceptual solutions from users\u2019 needs to realizable solutions through engineering design. Students will be taught in a studio and a workshop setting, and are expected to actively practice what they have learnt and to present their work professionally.",
