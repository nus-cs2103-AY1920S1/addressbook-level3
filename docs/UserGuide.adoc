== Introduction

*MoneyGoWhere* is a personal finance application targeted to students at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
It allows students to keep track of all their spending and their related information such as date, cost and tags.
Users can also set budget goals, view statistics, set reminders for bills and export their data to a Csv file.
With an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) and employment of Command Line Interface (CLI), users can easily navigate through the application, contributing to its user-friendliness and efficiency.

What are you waiting for? Start tracking your finances now!

== How To Use This Guide

The following section details and previews a few legends and formatting that will
be used throughout the user guide. These legends are used to represent
special information such as tips.

[NOTE]
Important information that should be noted.

[TIP]
Tips that can help you better navigate the application.

`test`: Command to be executed

====
Useful information for a deeper understanding of the command.
====

Without further ado, let's head over to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

These steps will guide you in installing MoneyGoWhere on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `MoneyGoWhere.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for MoneyGoWhere.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds as seen in Figure 1.
MoneyGoWhere comes preloaded with sample data to allow you to explore and familiarise with the application.

+
.User Interface of MoneyGoWhere
image::ui_annotate.png[width="1000"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* will display the help information.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all spending
* **`add`**`n/apple c/2.50 d/yesterday t/fruits r/expensive apple` : adds a spending `Apple` to MoneyGoWhere.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd spending shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. When you are ready to get started on tracking your own finances, do type `clear` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
This removes all the sample data from the application.

This is the end of the Quick Start tutorial. You can refer to <<Features>> for more details about each command.

[NOTE]
Your data is saved in the `data/` folder by default. You are advised not to modify any of the system created files within the folder,
else *MoneyGoWhere* may not perform as expected.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/apple`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/apple t/fruit` or as `n/apple`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `add n/NAME [t/TAG]...` can be used as `t/vegetable`, `t/fruit` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `add n/NAME c/COST`, `add c/COST n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a command accepts a single parameter and multiple parameters are provided, by default, the last parameter is chosen. e.g. if there is only one `n/NAME` accepted and the input is `n/One n/Two`, `n/Two` will be selected.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Shows a list of available commands and their usages. +

*Format:* `help`

[TIP]
Optionally, you can press kbd:[F1] or click `help` which can be found on the menu bar at the top left hand corner of the application.

The following image shows how the help bar can be accessed:

Listed above are the date formats that can be used.

[TIP]
You do not need to specify which date format you would like to use as MoneyGoWhere will be able to differentiate it from the input received. However, if today is Wednesday and `wednesday` is entered, it will be considered next's week Wednesday.

[NOTE]
MoneyGoWhere will also automatically check whether a given date is valid.
Should you accidentally provide an invalid date such as 31/02/2019, it will be rejected as there are only 28 days in February 2019. MoneyGoWhere may automatically try to correct dates *best possible date*.
// end::flexibledateformats[]

// tag::updown[]
=== Going through your command history:
Similar to a typical command line interface (CLI), the user may press the up and down key
to go through the previous user input history, and display it in the command box. Pressing the up key would go back to the earlier user input command.
Whereas pressing the down key would move towards the most recent user input key.

[NOTE]
If the user is at the most recent, or the earliest user inputted command, then press the up and down key respectively,
no text will be displayed.
// end::updown[]

=== Adding a spending : `add`

Adds a spending to the list when the user incurs a new spending. Key information such as its name, cost, date, tags (if any) and remarks (if any) are stored. +

*Format:* `add n/NAME c/COST d/DATE [t/TAG]... [r/REMARKS]`

[NOTE]
A spending can have any number of `t/TAG` keywords (including 0). Each `TAG` is limited to 64 characters. If a spending date is in the future, it can only be up to the end of this month. Also, if you are using a different currency, the cost entered may have precision errors as it will be converted to SGD.


*Examples:*

* `add n/apple c/2.50 d/yesterday t/fruits r/Expensive apple` +
* `add n/chicken breast c/1.80 d/today t/meat` +
* `add n/coffee c/1.20 d/today` +

=== Editing a spending : `edit`

Edits a spending at a specified index in the list. +

*Format:* `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [c/COST] [d/DATE] [t/TAG]... [r/REMARKS]`

****
* Edits the spending at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed spending list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the spending will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* Tags can have up to 15 characters.
* You can remove all the spending's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* If a spending date is in the future, it can only be up to end of this month.
* Spending entries that are added using a different currency will have output displayed in SGD.
* If you are using a different currency, the cost entered may have precision errors as it will be converted to SGD.
****

[NOTE]
In v1.4, this command does not support adding or removing a particular tag from a specific spending. Removing and adding of tags will be available from v2.0 onwards.

*Examples:*

* `edit 1 c/100` +
Updates the cost of the first spending to `100`.
* `edit 2 n/chicken rice` +
Updates the name of the third spending to `chicken rice`.
* `edit 5 c/500 n/flight tickets` +

*Expected Output:*

The specified spending is deleted.

=== Listing all spending : `list`

Displays a list of all spending and their information such as name, date, cost, tag and remark. +
*Format:* `list`

[NOTE]
By default, list of all spending is sorted by descending order of date, descending order of cost, ascending order of name and finally ascending order of remark. +

[TIP]
This command is implicitly invoked upon application start up, and can be used to reset the view after find or sort.

*Expected Output:*

All spending entries are listed.

// tag::find[]
=== Finding a spending : `find`

Searches for spending based on given keywords, cost range, date range, remarks or tags. You may refine the search results by entering more keywords. +

*Format:* `find [n/NAME_KEYWORDS] [c/COST_MIN] [c/COST_MAX] [d/DATE_START] [d/DATE_END] [r/REMARK_KEYWORDS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* At least one search field must be present and the search is case-insensitive. For example, `apple` and `Apple` will output the same search results.
* The order of the keywords do not matter for name and remarks. For example, `ticket concert` will match `concert ticket` and only full words will be matched. For example, `app` will not match `apple`.
* Spending matching at least one keyword will be returned. For example, `Phone` will return `New Phone`, `Phone Bill`.
* When searching for multiple tags, any tag listed will be matched along with the previous criteria. For example, if the search keyword was `d/yesterday d/today t/food t/entertainment`, spending entries within `yesterday` and `today` that have either tags `food` or `entertainment` will be matched.
****

[NOTE]

* Entering `SGD` as CURRENCYCODE will display an error since the entered value is already in SGD.
****

[TIP]
Due to network limitations, exchange rates are fixed and locally stored. Exchange rates may also vary across different websites.

[NOTE]
v1.4 does not have networking support for exchange rates. This will be available from v2.0 onwards.

*Example:*

* `exchangerate` +
Shows all exchange rates.
* `exchangerate 5 USD` +
Converts 5 USD to SGD based on current exchange rates.

Returns the current monthly budget, total spending and remaining budget in Singapore Dollars. +
*Format:* `showbudget`

*Expected Output:*

The budget for the current month along with the total spending in the month as well as remaining budget is shown.
// end::showbudget[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Generating statistics : `stats`
Organises the spending based on tags.
A pie chart is generated, with each sector representing the total amount of money spent on a tag.
This enables users to be more informed of their spending habits as they are now aware of where they have spent most of their money on.
An example is shown below.

.Output of `stats d/21/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`
image::stats.png[width="700"]


*Format:* `stats d/DATE_START d/DATE_END`

****
* Generates statistics for all spending that fall between and including the DATE_START and DATE_END specified by the user.
* If no DATE_START and DATE_END parameters are specified, the statistics generated will be based on the whole list of spending.
* Only spending that have at least a tag will be considered.
* Only the top few tags which incurred a more significant amount of money  will be displayed.
****

[NOTE]
Spending with multiple tags will be counted more than once in total as the statistics seek to show the user which tag they have spent the most money on.

[NOTE]
DATE_START must be earlier or the same as DATE_END.

[TIP]
Date range can be input in the following ways: +
`d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START to DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START - DATE_END`

[TIP]
The statistics panel will update every time the spending list displayed changes.
For example, when a new spending with a tag is added, the statistics panel will update the pie chart to show the statistics for all spending, including the new spending.

[TIP]
The statistics panel will update with the currency set.

*Examples:*

* `stats`: Generates statistics for all spending.

* `stats d/20/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`: Generates statistics for spending between and including 20/10/2019 and 25/10/2019.


*Expected Output:*

Statistics is shown.

// end::statistics[]

// tag::graph[]
=== Generating a graph : `graph`
Organises the spending based on date. A line graph is generated, with each point representing the total amount of money spent on a particular date.
This enables users to analyze trends in their spending amount over a particular period of time.
An example is shown below.

.Output of `graph d/21/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`
image::graph.png[width="700"]

*Format:* `graph d/DATE_START d/DATE_END`

****
* Generates a graph for all spending that fall between and including the DATE_START and DATE_END specified by the user.
* If no DATE_START and DATE_END parameters are specified, the statistics generated will be based on the whole list of spending.
* Only dates that have at least a spending will be recorded in the graph.
****

[NOTE]
DATE_START must be earlier or the same as DATE_END.

[TIP]
Date range can be input in the following ways: +
`d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START to DATE_END` +
`d/DATE_START - DATE_END`

[TIP]
Hovering the mouse over a point displays the date and total amount of money spent (to the nearest dollar) on that date.

[TIP]
The graph panel will update every time the spending list displayed changes.
For example, when a new spending is added, the graph panel will update and generate a graph for all spending, including the new spending.

[TIP]
The graph panel will update with the currency set.

*Examples:*

* `graph`: Generates a graph for all spending.
* `graph d/20/10/2019 d/25/10/2019`: Generates a graph for spending between and including 20/10/2019 and 25/10/2019.

*Expected Output:*

A graph is shown.

// end::graph[]

// tag::reminder[]

=== Adding a reminder: `reminder add`

Adds a reminder to the reminder list when the user enters a new reminder. Key information such as deadline and message are recorded.

*Format:* `reminder add d/DATE m/MESSAGE`

[NOTE]
The date of the deadline in a reminder must be in the future before the end of next year. In other words, MoneyGoWhere will accept dates starting from today until the end of next year as deadlines.

*Examples:*

* `reminder add d/30/08/2020 m/Pay school fees` +
* `reminder add d/3 days from now m/Pay phone bill` +

*Expected Output:*

A new reminder is added according to the information provided.

=== Deleting a reminder: `reminder delete`

Deletes the second reminder in the list based on the current results shown.

*Expected Output:*

The specified reminder is deleted.

// end::reminder[]

// tag::import[]
=== Importing data : `import`
*Format:* `import p/FILE_PATH` +

*Examples:* +

* `import p/data.csv`
