    "description": "Spintronics is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its application in spin-logic and devices, spin-polarized injection devices, and storage media. This is important for a variety of current and emerging applications in magnetic memories. This course equips students with essential knowledge of magnetism, and exchange interactions in solids; half metals, and dilute magnetic semiconductors; spin injection, transport and detection; and magnetic nanostructures, and their applications in: GMR read-write heads, MRAM, spinFET, spin-torque oscillators.",
