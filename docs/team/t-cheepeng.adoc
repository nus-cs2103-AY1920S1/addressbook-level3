== PROJECT: ExerHealth

== Overview

My team of 5 computer science students were tasked with changing a basic command line application. Our team
decided to morph the application into ExerHealth. **ExerHealth** is a desktop application used for tracking
and scheduling the user's exercises. The application has statistical analysis of exercises users have completed
in the past. Additionally, it also acts as a personal trainer by suggesting different exercises which both
beginners and advanced users can choose from to incorporate into their exercise regimes.
The user interacts with it using a command line interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Below is a screenshot of what our desktop application looks like:

My role in this project was to design and develop the scheduling and resolving of scheduling conflicts features.
The following sections will illustrate these additions to the application in finer details, as well as any
relevant documentation that I have added into the user and developer guide.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of the contributions I have made to the codebase of ExerHealth. It also shows the overview of the documentation provided and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement 1*: Added the ability to `schedule` exercise regimes
** What it does: The `schedule` command will allow users to schedule a stored exercise regime at a particular date of their choice.
** Justification: This feature will enable users to keep track and plan what exercise regimes they are supposed to complete. It also acts as a calendar to help users keep track of the regimes in the next few days, weeks or months.
** Highlights: This enhancement works well with existing features as well as future commands that
will be added to ExerHealth. An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to ensure that
future developers, including me, are able to extends and enhance this feature if need be.
The implementation itself was challenging because scheduling can lead to conflicts in what regimes to complete
at a particular date. However, this difficulty was remedied as described in *Major enhancement 2*.

* *Major enhancement 2*: Added the ability to `resolve` scheduling conflicts
** What it does: The `resolve` command will allow users to `resolve` conflicts that arise when two regimes are scheduled on the same date.
** Justification: This feature will allow users the flexibility to select which exercises they wish to do from the conflicting scheduled regimes. It also allows users to store the resolved regime and use it in the future.
** Highlights: This enhancement works well with *major enhancement 1* as there is a direct link between the two. The implementation of this feature was particularly challenging because multiple resources had to be kept track of. Also, there was a need to prevent users from proceeding on with normal usage of the program until they resolve the scheduling conflict. The aforementioned requirement was technically challenging and multiple facets had to be considered in the implementation of the feature.

* *Minor enhancement 1*: Added the display panel in the center of our UI to display more information of the selected resource.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=t-cheepeng&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[RepoSense]]

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the User Guide that was provided by the basic application(*addressbook*) so that it will reflect the features that we have added.
|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the *ExerHealth User Guide*. They show the additions I have made for the `schedule` and `resolve` features. The sections below will showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=scheduleresolve]

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
We had to update the Developer Guide that was provided by the basic application(*addressbook*) so it will convey to future developers the implementation details of our features.
|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the *ExerHealth Developer Guide*. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
