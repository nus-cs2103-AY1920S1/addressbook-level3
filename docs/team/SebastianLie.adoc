== PROJECT: Teacher's Notebook

---

== Overview

This project portfolio details my key contributions to Project Teacher's Notebook.

Teacher's Notebook is a desktop application designed by my group mates and I for a software engineering
module in National University of Singapore (NUS).
It's target audience is secondary or primary school teachers in Singapore.
It aims to improve the efficiency of these teachers,
by being a one-stop platform to consolidate information that teachers would need.


The user interacts with Teacher's Notebook using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC

== Summary of Contributions

- *Major Enhancement*: added the autocomplete feature to the gui
** What it does: add a popup menu that suggests commands to the user based on text the user has already entered
** Justification: Many commands in Teacher's Notebook are long and tedious, and have specific prefixes or formats.
By suggesting commands, users can quickly become familiar with commands, and save time not needing to remember the
format of commands. It also serves as a shortcut, as users can quickly enter commands without typing
out the entire command.
and easily select
** Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to view up to 10 suggestions in a popup menu.
The user can scroll through all suggestions and select any suggestion just using their keyboard.
Commands suggested are already in their required form with prefixes, making it easier for users
to execute the intended command successfully without referring to the UserGuide.

- *Minor Enhancement*: added the ability to upload a picture of a student, in only a PNG or JPG format.
- *Minor Enhancement*: added the ability to scroll through previously entered commands with the up and down arrow keys
