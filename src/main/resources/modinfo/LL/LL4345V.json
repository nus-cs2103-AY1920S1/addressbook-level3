It was a method designed to achieve both rigorous conceptual analysis and a fulfilled human life. In this course we will explore several of the methods philosophers have proposed for leading a fulfilled life and consider some of the rich suggestions or implications of these methods for leading a fulfilled life of the law, the life led by law students, lawyers, judges, and others interested in administering, shaping, or living according to law.",
