== PROJECT: Xpire

== Overview

Xpire is a desktop application used for tracking expiry dates of items. The user interacts with
it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with
JavaFX.

Xpire is developed as part of a CS2103T software engineering team project and it is a brownfield
project that is morphed from https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/addressbook-level3/[Address Book (Level 3)].

Xpire is mainly targeted at students living on campus and some of the features of Xpire include
an item expiry date tracker, a reminder system to notify users when an item is expiring or has already expired,
and an export functionality to share the tracking list with other devices.

== Notations and conventions used
[NOTE]
The symbol on the left is used to highlight crucial information.

`set reminder`:

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team project._

* https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=JermyTan&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Link to my codebase]
* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to export the item list through a QR code*
** What it does: It allows users to export the list of items that are currently being tracked to
any devices with QR code scanner, such as mobile phones and iPads.
** Justification: This feature enhances the product significantly as it enables the users to keep a copy
of the list of items in Xpire for easy reference. This is so that users can view the list and keep track of the items
at anywhere and anytime.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires knowledge of handling image data as well as an in-depth understanding of the
need to convert between png data and byte array. Additional challenges include building a JavaFX component to render the QR code
as a popup window and increasing the resolution of the QR code image to reduce the chances of failure when scanning
the code.

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to perform AND search*
** What it does: It allows user to perform an AND search instead of the typical OR search. e.g. an AND
search is akin to searching for items that contain "cold" AND "red" AND "cake" in its name while an OR search will be
similar to searching for items that contain either "cold" OR "red" OR "cake" in its name.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it allows users to perform more restrictive
searches. This makes it easier and faster for the users to search for the items they are looking for, especially when
there is a lot of items in the list.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires a remodelling of the `Model` 's architecture as well as writing a new
Application Programming Interface (API) since the current implementation of Address Book (Level 3) does not support
AND search. In other words, an in-depth analysis of the `Model` 's design architecture is required so that the new API
written to support AND search does not break any other existing features. This requires thorough testing and meticulous
integration skills and techniques.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *shorthand commands as an alternative to the full commands*. e.g. `search` can also be inputted
as `se`. This caters to users who wants to manage the items quickly using the application.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *partial search by name/exact search by tag(s)*. e.g. `search|foo|#Fruit`
will search for any item with name that partially matches `foo` or with tag(s) that exactly matches `#Fruit`.

=== Exporting data (multi-platform) : `export`

Thinking of viewing the list of currently tracked items on your mobile phone? Want to have a
copy of the to-buy items on your mobile phone so that you can refer to it while shopping?
With Xpire's `export` feature, you can easily transfer the list of items to any platform
by simply scanning the generated QR code.

Xpire can not only help you track your items' expiry dates, it can also export the current
list of items through a QR code (see Figure 1). Any device with a QR code reader will be
able to download the list of items (see Figure 2).

Format: `export`

.List of items received when scanning the QR code through a mobile phone
image::export-phone.PNG[width="250"]

[NOTE]
====
`export` is designed to work only on the current view list. In other words, `export` will only
export all items which exists in the current view list.

Depending on the operating system of your mobile phone, you may be directed to a google search
page after scanning the QR code. Follow the steps below to rectify this issue if necessary.
====

* Upon scanning the QR code, you may see a pop-up prompt suggesting to you to search the content
received on the web (see Figure 3).

.Pop-up prompt to suggest to search the content on the web
image::export-prompt.PNG[width="250"]

* Instead of immediately accepting the suggestion, press and hold on the prompt to reveal the other
options available (see Figure 4). Choose "Copy" or any other similar options.

.Additional options to handle the content
image::export-other-options.PNG[width="250"]

* Once the content has been copied, you can simply paste and save the content on Notes or any other
notepad application on your mobile phone (see Figure 5).

=== Searching for item(s) by name and/or tag: `search`

Having a hard time looking for an item in Xpire? Not to worry, Xpire provides a search functionality to aid you in finding your items with ease.

With `search`, you can simply input any words or phrases and Xpire will display all items whose names or tag(s) contain any of the given keywords.


Format: `search|<keyword>[|<other keywords>]...`

.Items matching #fruit or chicken shown
image::search.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
`search` is designed to work only on the current view list. In other words, `search` will only
display matching items which exists in the current view list.

[TIP]
You can do an AND search, e.g. search for items that contains BOTH `red` and `apple` in its name,
by keying `search|red` and then `search|apple`. Suppose there are only 3 items in your list, e.g.
 `red fuji apple`, `red strawberry` and `green apple` (see Figure 7), the above commands will display only `red
 fuji apple` (see Figure 8).

.Item list before searching
image::search-initial.png[width="790"]

.Item list after keying `search|red` and then `search|apple`
image::search-after.png[width="790"]

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `ham` will match `Ham` and `#fruit` will match `#Fruit`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Turkey Ham|Apple` will match `Apple|Turkey Ham`.
* Only the name and tag fields, if any, are searched.
* For name search, partial words can be matched e.g. `Papa` will match `Papayas`.
* For tag search, only exact words will be matched e.g. `#Fruit` will match `#Fruit` but `#Fru` will not match `#Fruit`.
* Items matching at least one keyword will be returned (an OR search). e.g. `Apple|Pear` will return `Granny Smith Apple` and `Japanese Pear`.
* If no items are found, any closely related keywords, if any, will be displayed.
****

Examples:

* `search|kebab` will display `Chicken Kebab` and `kebab` (see Figure 9).

.Item list after keying `search|kebab`
image::search-kebab.png[width="790"]

* `search|Chicken Ham` will display `Chicken Ham` (see Figure 10).

.Item list after keying `search|Chicken Ham`
image::search-chicken-ham.png[width="790"]

* `search|milk|tea|#Drink` will display any items with names containing `milk` or `tea`, or with the tag `#Drink`.

=== Export

This feature allows users to export the items in the current view list to other devices through a QR code.
Any device with a QR code reader will be able to download the list of items.

This implementation is under `Logic` and `Model` components, and it uses a helper method from `StringUtil`.

==== Implementation

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario.

.Sequence diagram illustrating the export mechanism
image::SequenceDiagramExport.png[width="790"]

Example usage scenario:

Step 1. User enters command `export`. The command is received by the `LogicManager`'s `execute` method which
then calls the `getCurrentView` method of `Model` to determine which item list is currently being displayed, `XPIRE`
or `REPLENISH`.

Step 2. Depending on which item list is currently being displayed, either `XpireParser` 's or `ReplenishParser` 's `parse`
method will be called to create a `ExportCommand` object. The `ExportCommand` object will be returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls the returned `ExportCommand` object's `execute` method which calls the
`getCurrentList` method of `Model` to retrieve the list of items in the current view list.

Step 4. The items in the current view list is then converted to its string representation and then passed into the `getQrCode`
method in `StringUtil`.

Step 5. The `getQrCode` method uses https://github.com/zxing/zxing[Google ZXing] library to process the input string
into a QR code and this QR code is subsequently converted to a byte array (`pngData`) so that it can be passed around easily.

Step 6. Upon successful creation of the QR code data, a `CommandResult` object will be created by `ExportCommand` to encapsulate
a feedback message and the QR code data, which will be rendered and shown to the user. The `CommandResult` will then be returned to the `LogicManager`.

The following UML activity diagram will further demonstrate the high-level workflow of the `export` command.

[NOTE]
The selection of parser and the creation of `ExportCommand` object is omitted for brevity.

.Activity diagram illustrating the high-level workflow of search command
image::ActivityDiagramExportCommand.png[width="790"]

As illustrated in Figure 12, the `export` functionality also considers the case where the current view list
is empty and there will be a feedback to the user to inform him/her that the `export` command is not executed
successfully.

==== Design Consideration

Below highlights the essential design consideration while implementing this feature.

===== Aspect: What is the most suitable type of export functionality required for this application?

* **Option 1:** Export to a csv file.
** Pros:
*** Easily transferable and shared to other computers.
*** Easily allows user to edit the exported data.
** Cons:
*** Does not work well on other platforms such as mobile phones and iPads.
*** Slow to transfer the data to other computers. Have manually transfer the
csv file through email, thumb drive or cloud drive.
* **Option 2 (current choice):** Export through QR code.
** Pros:
*** Allows data to be easily transferred to any device with QR code scanner.
*** Instantaneous data transfer upon scanning the QR code.
** Cons:
*** Hard to be shared to other computers since computers generally do not have QR code scanner.
*** Focuses more on ready-only rather than editing the data.

Since Xpire is an application that helps users keep track of items' expiry dates as well as
maintain a list of to-buy items for users' reference, its exported data should focus more on
conveniently showing users the items' information rather than emphasise on editing the data.

As such, due to the nature of this application, option 2 was chosen since it can precisely meet
the needs of the users, which is to be able to easily view the exported data anywhere and anytime
through their mobile phones.

=== Search by name or tag(s)

This feature allows users to filter out specific items either by name or by tag(s) through providing
the relevant keyword(s). Items which contain any of the keywords will be shown on the view panel.
For search by name, partial words can be matched. For search by tag, only exact words will be matched.

This implementation is under `Logic` and `Model` components.

==== Implementation

Below are the UML sequence diagrams an example usage scenario.

[NOTE]
Parsing of arguments is omitted from the diagram above to place greater emphasis on the filtering process.
The diagram below further illustrates the parsing of arguments.

To further demonstrate the high-level workflow of the `search` command, the following UML activity diagram is provided:

[NOTE]
The selection of parser and the creation of `SearchCommand` object is omitted for brevity.

.Activity diagram illustrating the high-level workflow of search command
image::ActivityDiagramSearchCommand.png[width="790"]

As illustrated in Figure 15, the `search` functionality also considers the case where the current view list
is empty and there will be a feedback to the user to inform him/her that the `search` command is not executed
successfully.

==== Design Considerations

Below highlights the different considerations while implementing this feature.

===== Aspect: How to implement AND search?

* **Option 1 (initial choice):** Modify the input command format to include "&" as a separator. The "&" separator will be placed between 2 keywords to signify an AND condition between the them.
** Pros:
*** Requires only a single `search` command to do both AND and OR search.
*** There is no need to change the original architecture for `Model`.
** Cons:
*** Complicates the input command format (since it has both "|" and "&" separators) and makes it not user-friendly.
*** Could be confusing to the user when they want to a mix of AND and OR conditions in a single `search` command.
*** Could be difficult to parse correctly since there are 2 different separators.
*** Extra work has to be done to change the ContainsKeywordsPredicate to accept AND condition.
* **Option 2 (current choice):** Make the `search` command "stackable". Every `search` command will now only
execute on the current view list. e.g. the result of a `search` command can be further filtered with another `search` command.
** Pros:
*** Users can intuitively make an AND search of 2 or more keywords by first searching with 1 keyword and then
search again with another keyword, and repeat again for more keywords.
*** There is no change to the input command format.
** Cons:
*** Requires multiple `search` commands to be executed for AND search.
*** Have to figure out how to implement "stackable" commands.

===== Aspect: How to implement "stackable" commands?

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Modify the `ModelManager`.
** Pros:
*** Uses the separation of concerns principle. The commands do not need to know how the item list will behave when they are executed.
They simply need to make the relevant Application Programming Interface (API) calls and the `ModelManager` will handle the behaviour
of the list.
*** Adheres to the open-closed principle. The commands do not need to make any changes to its architecture and other commands can
also be made "stackable" through using the API.
** Cons:
*** Have to modify the `ModelManager` 's architecture to support the API that modifies the current view list.
* **Option 2:** Modify the commands.
** Pros:
*** Do not need to modify the API.
** Cons:
*** Violates single responsibility principle. The commands will now handle both the execution algorithm and the behaviour of the item list.
*** Violates open-closed principle. The `Command` 's architecture will have to be modified to be "stackable".
