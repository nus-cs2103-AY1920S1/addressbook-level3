    "description": "Money is an all-pervasive legal concept, and an integral part of public dealings by the state and most private transactions. The module aims to develop a distinctive understanding of the legal institution of money, seen as a subject in itself, from private-law and legal-historical perspectives. The module explains the role of law in the creation of money and in the ordering of a monetary system. It explains how law has a role to play in recognising and enforcing concepts of monetary value in private transactions. It considers the distinctive ways that property law applies to money, including the role of property law in controlling the consequences of failed or wrongly-procured payment transactions. The module considers the capacity of private law to respond to the special problems of monetary transactions involving a foreign currency system, and the legal challenges posed by new monetary developments such as cyber-currencies.",
