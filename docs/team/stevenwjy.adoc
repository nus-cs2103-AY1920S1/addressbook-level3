== PROJECT: TagLine

== About the project

My team of 5 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface desktop address book application for our Software Engineering project.

We chose to morph it into a note management application called Tagline. This enhanced application enables students to take notes easily and associate them with contacts.

Below is a screenshot of our project:

My main role was to create a contact profile feature to display notes that are associated with a contact along with other information that are stored about the contact (e.g. email and phone number).

The following sections illustrate some more specific enhancements I have made, as well as some relevant documentation in the user and developer guides related to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I added the ability for user to associate notes with contacts and display contact profile.
** What it does:
*** User can create association between a contact and a note by tagging the note with contact or group tags that represent the contact.
*** When a user uses `contact show` command, there will be a view to display contact information (e.g. name and email) and all notes that are associated to that contact.
** Justification: This feature benefits users because they can easily view all notes that are related with a contact.
** Highlights:
*** There were challenging design decisions about the data to be stored for contact and group tags because they inherit the same tag superclass but do not have any shared attributes.
*** To standardize with note filtering implementation, the contact id that is specified through the `contact show` command will be translated into multiple tags that represent the contact.
*** The GUI for contact profile is like a combination of both contact and note GUIs.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added a command to list all tags that have been used in Tagline.
** What it does: Every time a user enters a valid tag, it will be recorded into the tag book which serves as a history of tags used.
** Justification: This feature benefits forgetful users to view tags that they have used previously.
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement added a new command type with `tag` as its prefix.
*** The implementation was challenging as it added additional complexity to the application to have a separate parser, command, model, and storage for tags.
** Credits: The architecture and code of `tag list` command was reused and morphed from AddressBook command.
