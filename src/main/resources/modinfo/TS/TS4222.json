    "description": "The module trains students to become independent performance-based researchers in applied theatre. Students further develop their critical and creative skills through exposure to key practical approaches and critical theories in the field. To consolidate skills in integrating practice with theory, students will undertake Performance as Research projects of considerable scope with attention given to the social and cultural complexity of specific communities and contexts. Applied theatre as a form of social intervention, community engagement and knowledge production will be examined.",
