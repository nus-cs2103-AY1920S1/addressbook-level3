== About The Project

My team of 4 Computer Science students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface
desktop address book application for our CS2103T module, and we chose to modify it into a 3-in-1 application that serves
as a tool to aid revision called StudyBuddy. This application allows students to store and utilize flashcards, create
notes that can be later used to generate a reference to create a cheat sheet.

This is what our project looks like:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *ability to start a time trial of flashcards.*
** What it does: The `timetrial` command initializes a test whereby the user will be tested a sequence of flashcards.
** Justification: Pushes the user to test his understanding / familiarity of a certain topic.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. An in-depth analysis of design
alternatives was necessary to implement the feature in a way that doesn’t disrupt other features. The implementation was also challenging because there was a need to read up on an existing API that I did not have prior experience in.
** Credits: Usage of the timeline api and linking the timer to a label was inspired by: https://asgteach.com/2011/10/javafx-animation-and-binding-simple-countdown-timer-2/

* *Minor enhancement*: Designed the overall GUI of the StudyBuddyPro application.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=chanjunren[Functional code]]

* *Other contributions*:

* Project management:
** Facilitated discussion of the overall direction of the application in v1.1.

* Developing existing features:
** Implemented the switching of modes and hooking up the activity window to the respective modes(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/162[#162]).
** Implemented the viewing and showing of flashcards(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/133[#133])(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/200[#200]).
** Implemented the time trial feature of the Flashcard(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/198[#198]).

* Enhancements to existing features:
** Designed the overall GUI of the StudyBuddyPro(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/123/commits/2964fbad0c7a09397ea1aea0d76867204e3395f1[#123])
** Enhanced delete commands to prompt the user once to confirm his/her deletion(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/244[#244]).
** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase the test coverage.

* Documentation:
** Added the command summary for the team(link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/338[#338]).

* Community:
** Reported bugs and offered suggestions for the other team during the Practical Exam dry run.

=== Time Trial: `timetrial`

Starts a time trial for flashcards with specified tags <TAG>.

    Format: timetrial TAG...

    Example usage: timetrial cs2103tuml hard

    Expected output: Time trial started

All of the flashcards containing the specified tags will be then displayed sequentially in the activity below.

* At least one tag must be specified.
* If more than one tag is specified, selects all flashcards that contains all of the specified tags.
* Default <TIME> will be 5 seconds.
* Answer will be flashed for 3 seconds.
* If a flashcard command (other than `show`) is inputted during the time trial, the time trial will be terminated and the inputted
command will be executed.
* Executing `show` will reveal the answer of the flashcard in advance, but will not terminate the time trial.

=== Flashcards Time Trial Feature

[IMPORTANT]
The following commands assume that the user is in the _flashcard_ mode.

==== Implementation
a.	The time trial mechanism is facilitated by the `FlashcardTabWindowController`, and mainly uses the `Timeline`, `KeyFrame` and `KeyValue` class from the JavaFX package to support its functionality.
+
The following _figure_ shows a class diagram of the relevant classes of the time trial feature.

The following _figure_ is an activity diagram of the flow of events when a user attempts to start a time trial.

image::jrImages/TimeTrialActivityDiagram.png[]

b.	Given below is an example usage scenario and how the time trial mechanism behaves at each step.
c. Upon initialization of the StudyBuddy and switching to the Flashcard window, the `StudyBuddyParser`’s function enum will be set to parse `Flashcard` commands.
d.	The user executes (timetrial cs2100), and the `StartTimeTrialCommand` retrieves a List of flashcards with the associated `Tag` through the `Model#getTaggedFlashcards`, which is then passed into the `FlashcardTabWindowController`.
e.	The `FlashcardTabWindowController` then calls the `FlashcardTabWindowController#startTimeTrial`, which in turns construct a `Timeline` with the following added for 3 flashcards:
1.	A `KeyFrame` to call the `FlashcardTabWindowController#loadTimeTrial` method, which displays the question of the flashcard on the window, with a `KeyValue` that starts the timer on the screen.
2.	A `KeyFrame` to call the `FlashcardTabWindowController#showFlashcardAns` method, which hides the Timer and flashes the answer of the flashcard for a set period of time.
3.	A `KeyFrame` is then added to the timeline to call the `FlashcardTabWindowController#resetViews` method, which in turn empties the qnsTextArea and ansTextArea. [TO BE REFORMATTED]

The following _figure_ is an activity diagram that summarizes the flow of events when a user attempts to start a time trial as described above:

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the timetrial is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** 1.	Using the `TimeLine` class to set the timer
object.
** Pros: Tidier and easier to understand.
** Cons: Have to read up on the API and learn about the relevant classes such as `KeyFrame` and `KeyValue`
* **Alternative 2:** Looping `Thread.sleep()` to set the timer
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: Code will be messier and harder to read

===== Aspect: How to continue the time trial

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Each flashcard and its’ respective answer is displayed for a set period of time before the next flashcard**
** Pros: Easier to implement
** Cons: Inflexible as user can only view the answer for a set amount of time
* **Alternative 2:** Allowing users to input commands to display the flashcard answer / move on to the next flashcard
** Pros: Better flow of time trial feature and improved user experience
** Cons: Hard to implement

==== [Proposed] Future improvements
** Allowing users to set their own time limit for each flashcard in the time trial mode
*** Command will be inputted to set the duration of the timer for each flashcard
** Allowing users to decide when to move on to the next flashcard
*** Question will still be shown for a fixed period of time, but a command will be required to move on to the next flashcard instead of just flashing the answer for a set amount of time


=== Testing `timetrial` command
[NOTE]
====
The following commands have been provided for ease of testing and can be inputted to test some of the test cases:

. add q/Question 1 a/Answer 1 t/q1 tag/test
. add q/Question 2 a/Answer 2 t/q2 tag/test
====

* Test case 1

... There exist flashcards with the tags that you would like to specify.

.. Input command:  `timetrial [tag]`

.. Expected:
... Feedback box outputs:

    Time trial started

... The question of the flashcard is displayed together with a timer for 5 seconds.
... Once the time hits 0, the answer is flashed for 3 seconds.
... Repeat 2 and 3 until all of the flashcards of the specified tags have been displayed.

* Test case 2
.. Prerequisites
... Currently in flashcard mode with the Flashcard icon highlighted.
... There exist flashcards with the tags that you would like to specify.

.. Input command: `timetrial [tag]`.
.. Input command: `show`.
.. Expected:
... Feedback box outputs:

    Flashcard answer loaded

... The answer of the flashcard is loaded, and after a while the time trial continues until all the flashcards have been loaded.


* Test case 3

... Currently in flashcard mode with the Flashcard icon highlighted.
... There exist flashcards with the tags that you would like to specify.

.. Input command: `timetrial [tag]`.
.. Input command: `view 3` (Can be any other flashcard comamand).
.. Expected:
... Feedback box outputs:

    Viewing flashcard:  Title: (Flashcard title)
    Tags: [tags]

... Time trial does not continue and the latest command inputted is executed.

* Test case 4
.. Prerequisites
... Currently in flashcard mode with the Flashcard icon highlighted.
... There are no flashcards with the tags that you would like to specify.

.. Input command: `timetrial [tag]`.
.. Expected:
... Feedback box outputs:

    There are no flashcards with the tags specified!
