    "description": "This module is concerned with the design of offshore structures and elements including fixed and floating offshore structures, like semi-submersibles, FPSOs, spar platforms, floating jack-up structures and elements such as reinforced (hull) plating and mooring turntables. Topsides design principles, key hydrodynamic effects and environmental loading will be highlighted. Important concepts such as the design process, construction and installations requirements and interactions among platform elements are introduced. Also covered are the methods of analysis and criteria in design such as stability, wave loading and motion in waves, (dynamic) positioning, mooring system components, structural strength and fatigue, and design safety assessment codes.",
