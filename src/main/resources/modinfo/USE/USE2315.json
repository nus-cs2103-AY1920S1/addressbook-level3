    "description": "Southeast Asia is widely regarded as a model for economic development due to its advances in alleviating poverty, improving infrastructure, and fostering education and healthcare. But economic success often overshadows critical social problems that arise in tandem with such rapid development. This module, offered only in special summer sessions, takes a hands-on approach to examining critical issues in social development, in particular those revolving around local empowerment, democratization, and sustainability. Working within a framework of participatory action research, and collaborating with peers at another ASEAN university, this rigorous course includes substantial fieldwork conducted among development projects outside of Singapore.",
