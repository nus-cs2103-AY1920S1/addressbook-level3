    "description": "The focus of this course is organic chemistry as practiced nowadays with all its complexity and beauty revealed through primary literature. Building on the foundations of YSC2224 Organic Chemistry with Laboratory, we shall look closely at reaction mechanisms and catalysts, learn about important but short-lived chemical species, and practise the art of designing synthetic strategies to build difficult molecules in efficient or creative ways.",
