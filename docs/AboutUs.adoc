DukeCooks is a healthy lifestyle app developed by our team.

DukeCooks is proudly developed by a group of second-year students from the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore]. +
The https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook3] (AB3), was used and referenced to make DukeCooks. As such, this is a brownfield project which entails morphing AB3 into a new application which in this case, DukeCooks.
