    "description": "This course examines the strategic decisions new entrepreneurs take in order to start, finance, and guide their businesses. It will explore strategic frameworks that both successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs undertake in order to operate in dynamic and uncertain competitive landscapes. A major tenet of this course is that experimentation plays a central role in entrepreneurial strategy and that correct strategic responses are not always clear. But through analysis of case studies and discussions with guest speakers we will understand how successful entrepreneurs execute decisions that maintain their competitive advantages.",
