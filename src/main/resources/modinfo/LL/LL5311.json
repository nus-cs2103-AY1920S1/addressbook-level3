    "description": "This course will offer an historical and comparative focus on Islamic family law. It will begin by providing a basic overview of Islamic law generally and then turn to examine Islamic family law specifically. It will then cover major topics that arise in Islamic family law under the classical Islamic legal tradition. It will conclude by exploring how many of those issues arise in some modern contexts, as Islamic family law is applied both inside and outside of the Muslim world.",
