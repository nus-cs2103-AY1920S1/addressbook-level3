    "description": "The objective of this module is to introduce students to the materials that are commonly used in the manufacture and fabrication of products. It will enable students to acquire basic knowledge on the properties and performance of materials and enable them to select materials for specific design applications. It will cover the manufacturing and fabrication processes associated with the materials and application. It appeals to product designers involved in consumer electronics, domestic appliances, kitchen wares, furniture, lighting, and packaging. Students are expected to gain an operationally-ready level of mastery through hands-on experimentation in projects for the above areas.",
