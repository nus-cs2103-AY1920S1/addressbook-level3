    "description": "Some of the most important turning points in world history have resulted\nin, and from, territorial expansion and conquest of both inhabited and\nuninhabited frontiers. Many of the international laws we now take for\ngranted emerged as the result of highly contentious and uncertain\nincursions into previously un-regulated domains.\nIn this course, students will explore the root causes of state-led territorial\nexpansion and the ramifications of conquest and domination for\ninternational law. We will analyse theories of conquest and delve into\ncase studies of particular cases of expansion into inhabited territory (e.g.\nJapan\u2019s Co-Prosperity Sphere, United States\u2019 westward expansion across\nAmerica, German expansion in Western and Eastern Europe) and state\nexpansion into uninhabited frontiers (e.g. South China Sea disputes,\nairspace, outer space, Antarctica, the deep sea). Students will learn to analyse and critique competing arguments, synthesize explanatory\nlenses, and perform research into this arena of international politics and\nlaw.",
