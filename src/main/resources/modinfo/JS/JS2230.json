    "description": "This module exposes students to country and culture of Japan using food as its analytic focal point. In the section on historical, political and economic perspectives, students will uncover the ways that food in Japan influences state policies, creates international conflicts and contributes to the formation of national identity. In the section on socio-cultural perspectives, students will learn to evaluate the ways that food creates meaning in such realms as language, education, media programming, and religious practices. Concepts covered in this course will be applicable to a broad range of phenomenon outside of Japan and outside the topic of food.",
