    "description": "The module examines representations of politics in film and television and considers the ways in which they become politically controversial as objects of regulation and censorship, economic commodities or projections of cultural \u2018soft power\u2019. It also considers the reflexive potential of film and television to comment their socio\u2010political role as well as on their own representation of politics. The module explores these themes in a variety of cinematic and televisual ways of representing politics, including documentaries, dramas, historical re\u2010enactments, and comedies.",
