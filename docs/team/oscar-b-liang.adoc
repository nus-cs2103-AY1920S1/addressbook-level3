== PROJECT: FlashMind

---

=== Overview

FlashMind is a desktop flashcard application which helps users memory short concepts and knowledge. For example,
user can use to memorize vocabularies and some terms worth memorizing in particular subjects. This project was
inspired by the software engineering model where there are many not-so-well organized terms and principles students
needs to memorize. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it has a GUI created with javaFX. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major contribution*: Build the skeleton of the program with complete storage system, UI, basic structure of a flashcard and some basic commands. Future developments of this project
are all based on this skeleton.

** Justification: This piece of work can hardly be identified by users, but it is crucial. In the first week, we were working without
a skeleton so that our works all crashes into each other. Therefore, a fundamental skeleton was built first which gives us the space
and structure to improve further features and the user interface. The most important thing is that we effectively avoided conflicts
with each other's work.

** Highlights: I will not say this was a challenging task because the skeleton relied heavily with the AddressBook - Level 3 (AB3)'s structure.
However, it was a very troublesome and time consuming task. I spent a whole week doing nothing but eating, sleeping and coding to finish this skeleton.

** Credits: The structure heavily relied on AB3 structure, but an obvious modification in the structure of flashcards.

* *Second major contributions*: Maintaining the storage system of FlashMind. There are many cases where the user just somehow love
to modify the Json files. This can be fatal to MCQ flashcards since the user might encounter the situation where none of the
choices in an Mcq flashcard which can match the answer. Thus, we applied defensive programming to avoid loading invalid MCQ flashcards.

* *Minor contributions*: Add *ListByTag*, *ListTag*, *DeleteTag* commands. Modified *Add* and *Edit* commands to fit into
our flashcard system.

** Justification: These newly added commands allows the user to manage their flashcard by certain tags. This will be very useful for
users who has a huge number of flashcards, especially for those who are memorizing vocabularies.

* Other contributions:

** Project management: Managed release v1.3 on Github. Took charge of integrating and resolving conflicts between team members' code.

** Documentation: Made a significant contribution in the teams' User Guide and Developer's Guide. Updated most of the UML diagrams in the developer's guide.

*I clearly clarify here that Quiz, Flip and Stats features are all NOT implemented by
me, they are implemented by my teammates. I simply drew the sequence diagrams of these features.*
