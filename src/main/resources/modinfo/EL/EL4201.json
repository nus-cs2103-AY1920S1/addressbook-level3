    "description": "This module has two broad aims. The first is to familiarize students with the core theoretical ideas shared by current syntactic frameworks, and to provide a sense of what it takes to pursue theoretically informed research in syntax that involves a technical framework of representations and principles. The second aim is to develop in students the abilities and thinking habits required for theoretical research in syntax. The acquaintance with linguistic theory and the practice in the linguist's modes of thinking developed in the module will help students engage in meaningful research in syntax.",
