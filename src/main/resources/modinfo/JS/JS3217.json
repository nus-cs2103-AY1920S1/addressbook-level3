Approximately equal time will be spent on (1) ancient and medieval art and sculpture, (2) arts of the early modern period, and (3) modern artistic trends since the Meiji Restoration. The aim is to deepen students' appreciation of Japanese art by considering historical contexts, discussing the ideas and feelings conveyed by the art, and probing the aesthetic and philosophical concepts behind the art.",
