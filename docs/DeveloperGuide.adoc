== Introduction

=== LiBerry
LiBerry is a desktop app for librarians to *quickly manage their community libraries!*
LiBerry is optimized for librarians who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
You can type quickly and serve your long line of borrowers in a short amount of time.
LiBerry can manage all your books and borrowers efficiently and meticulously.

=== Purpose of Developer Guide
This developer guide is targeted towards *potential developers* of the project and it aims to explain:

* The *design* of the software architecture of the system using a top-down approach
* The *implementation* and *behaviour* of the main features of the system.

=== Legend

TIP: Denotes useful tips.

NOTE: Denotes additional information.

== Setting up

To set up LiBerry on your system, please refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
In this section, we will explain the design and behaviour of the top-level components in the system, which are the following:

* Architecture overview
* User Interface (UI) Component
* Logic Component
* Model Component
* Storage Component

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This sub-section shows the *relationship* between the major components at the highest level, illustrated by the following diagram.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[align=center]

{nbsp} +

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

TIP: The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the system consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the system.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the system in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

{nbsp} +

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add t/Animal Farm a/George`.

.Component interactions for `add t/Animal Farm a/George` command
image::AddBook.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +

In the diagram above, we can see how the components integrate together to execute a single command. +
{nbsp} +
The sections below give more details about each component, starting of with the UI component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This sub-section shows the structure of the User Interface (UI) and the relationship between each component in the UI. +
{nbsp} +
The following diagram aims to illustrate how each UI sub-component is linked to one another.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +

In the figure above, we can see the association between the different UI sub-components, as well as the classes that interact with the external `Logic` and `Model` components.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up these main parts:

* `CommandBox`
* `ResultDisplay`
* `BookListPanel`
*  Other smaller components

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within
the UI component when the user enters an add command.
The exact command entered is `add t/Animal Farm a/George`.

.Interactions Inside the UI Component for the `add t/Animal Farm a/George` Command
image::UiAddBookSequenceDiagram.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +

In the figure above, we can see how the UI components invoke the `execute` method of the `Logic` class in order to obtain and subsequently display the result of the execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens to the `UI` component
when a user executes a new command:

.Flow of Events within `UI`
image::UiUpdateBookListActivityDiagram.png[width=270, align=center]
{nbsp} +
The activity diagram above aims to illustrate how `UI` only updates the `BookListPanel` when the catalog is being updated by a command. +
We will now move on to give more details about the `Logic` component.
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
In this sub-section, we will explain the internal workings of the `Logic` component, which handles the execution of the different commands. +
{nbsp} +
The following class diagram aims to show how the 'Command Design Pattern' is used to achieve a high-level form of encapsulation of the `Command` object.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +
In the diagram above, we can see that the `LogicManager` executes the `Command` class without knowledge of what each command does. This is achieve through polymorphism where all possible commands extend from the `Command` class.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CatalogParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add t/Animal Farm a/George")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add t/Animal Farm a/George` Command
image::AddBookLogicSequenceDiagram.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +
In the diagram above, we can see that the `Logic` component's `execute` is invoked by the `UI` component from before. A series of method calls would invoke the `addBook` method of the `Model`, moving the chain of calls further downstream.

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
{nbsp} +

In short, the `Logic` component interprets the different commands and execute them accordingly. Most of these commands will have to interact with the `Model` component, which we will explore in the next sub-section.
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The `Model` component is mainly composed of the `Book`, `Borrower` and `Loan` classes and shows how they are related to one another.
{nbsp} +

The figure below shows the relationship between smaller components. These smaller components are modelled after real world objects.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +

The figure illustrates the composition of the `Model` component. The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Catalog data.
* stores the Loan Records.
* stores the Borrower Records.
* references a borrower that is being served if the model is in serve mode.
* references a list of filtered books which depends on the state of the model.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

{nbsp} +
When there are changes in the `Model` component, the system will update its in-memory via the `Storage` component, which will be explained in-depth in the next section.
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The `Storage` component is responsible for updating the memory of the system (in `JSON` format) whenever there are changes.

{nbsp} +
The figure below aims to show the different records storage that are implemented in LiBerry.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[align=center]
{nbsp} +

In the figure above, we can see that we are maintaining 4 different storages. These storages aim to keep the memory of:

* `UserPrefs`
* `Catalog`
* `BorrowerRecords`
* `LoanRecords`

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in `JSON` format and read it back.
* can save LiBerry data in `JSON` format and read it back.

There are certain classes (eg. Utility classes) that are used by different components. In the following section, we will explain how we allow all components to access these classes.
[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
These classes include (to list a few):

* User Settings
* Exceptions
* Utility classes like `DateUtil`, `FineUtil` and `JsonUtil`

We will now move on to the next section, which aims to explain the implementation of some of our main features.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Add book feature
This feature allows a user to add a new book to the LiBerry system.

//tag::addBook[]
==== Details of Implementation

The add book function is facilitated by `Catalog`.
The `Catalog` stores a list of books, representing the books in the library.
Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Catalog#addBook(book)` -- Add a new book to the list of books in the catalog.

Given below is an activity diagram of a book being added to the catalog.

.Activity Diagram for adding a book
image::AddBookActivityDiagram.png[width=400, align=center]
NOTE: The else branch of each branch node should have a guard condition `[else]` but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
they are not shown.

{nbsp} +
We can clearly see how the system decides to generate a valid serial number base on whether the user input contains a valid serial number or not. +
{nbsp} +
After the book is added to the system, we can now represent it with a class diagram shown below.

.Class Diagram for `Book`
image::BookClassDiagram.png[width=400, align=center]
{nbsp} +

Notice how the book can hold either *1 or 0 loans*, depending on whether it is currently loaned out or not. +
{nbsp} +
The current state of this newly-added book is further illustrated by the object diagram below.

.Object Diagram for `Book`
image::BookObjectDiagram.png[width=300, align=center]
{nbsp} +

We can see that the book holds an `Optional<Loan>` and has an empty `LoanHistory`,
making it consistent with the class diagram of `Book` above.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to store books.

* **Alternative 1 :** Store them only in a ObservableList as per the original AddressBook implementation.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: Iterating through the list of books to retrieve one may be inefficient.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Store them in a HashMap.
** Pros: Will be easier (and more readable ) to retrieve books by serial number.
** Cons: Will incur additional memory to maintain the HashMap.

*We have decided to go with Alternative 2.* There is a lot of retrieval of book objects within the Book and Loan features.
Therefore, the benefits of quick retrieval of book will outweigh the additional memory costs incurred to maintain the HashMap.

===== Aspect: Generating a unique serial number.
Since we allow librarians to provide their own valid serial number when adding a book, we cannot use the
number of books or the largest serial number to generate the next serial number.

* **Alternative 1:** Use a TreeMap to store current serial numbers.
** Pros: Will be efficient in generating the next valid serial number.
** Cons: Will incur additional memory to maintain the TreeMap. Might also result in unexpected behaviour in some edge cases.
* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** Iterate from the beginning to obtain the first unused serial number.
** Pros: Will be easy to implement.
** Cons: Will be inefficient once the number of books grow.

*We have decided to go with Alternative 2* and keep it simple. This is because there are some cases which leads to
unexpected behaviour from Alternative 1. Furthermore, Alternative 2 is in line with the *KISS* (Keep it Simple, Stupid) principle of programming.
//end::addBook[]

// tag::undo/redo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Details of Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory`.
It contains a undo/redo command history, stored internally as an
`commandHistoryList` and `currentCommandPointer`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CommandHistory#commit()` -- Saves the current reversible command in its command history.
* `CommandHistory#getUndoCommand()` -- Returns the undo command for the most recent reversible command.
* `CommandHistory#getRedoCommand()` -- Returns the redo command for the most recent undone command.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCommand()`,
`Model#getUndoCommand()` and `Model#getRedoCommand()` respectively.

The undo/redo mechanism only works for commands that implements
the `ReversibleCommand` interface. Currently, this mechanism only works
for commands that modifies the catalog, loan records, borrower records
or user settings.

Below, is the list of commands that can be undone/redone:

Undoable/Redoable Commands:

* `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `loan`, `register`, `renew`,
`return`, `set`, `toggleui` and `unregister`.

NOTE: After every `serve`, `done` and `pay` command, the command history
is cleared. This means that you will not be able to undo after entering
one of the commands above. This is done to ensure that the user
do not accidentally modify books that have been loaned out and
that payments are not refundable.

The `ReversibleCommand` interface specifies that each command contains
these three operations:

* `ReversibleCommand#getUndoCommand()` -- Returns a command that undoes the `ReversibleCommand`.
* `ReversibleCommand#getRedoCommand()` -- Returns a command that redoes the `ReversibleCommand`.
* `ReversibleCommand#getCommandResult()` -- Returns the command result of the `ReversibleCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism
behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `CommandHistory` will be initialized with an empty `commandHistoryList` as
shown in the figure below.

.Initial state of CommandHistory
image::UndoRedoState0.png[width=250, align=center]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th
book in the catalog. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCommand()`,
causing the `delete 5` command to be saved in the `commandHistoryList`,
and the `currentCommandPointer` is pointed to the newly inserted command
as shown in the figure below.

.State of CommandHistory after `delete 5`
image::UndoRedoState1.png[width=250, align=center]

Step 3. The user executes `add t/Animal Farm ...` to add a new book.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCommand()`, causing the add
command to be saved into the `commandHistoryList` as shown in the figure
below.

.State of CommandHistory after `add t/Animal Farm`
image::UndoRedoState2.png[width=250, align=center]

NOTE: If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCommand()`,
so the command will not be saved into the `commandHistoryList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake,
and decides to undo that action by executing the `UndoCommand`.
During the execution of the `UndoCommand`, `Model#getUndoCommand()`
will be called. This would call `CommandHistory#getUndoCommand()`, which
will retrieve the most recent `ReversibleCommand` that was executed, which is
the `add` command. `ReversibleCommand#getUndoCommand()` would then be called
and the `Command` returned would be executed, undoing the add command.
This will then shift the `currentCommandPointer` once to the left, pointing it
to the previous `ReversibleCommand` in the `commandListHistory` as shown in
the figure below.

.State of CommandHistory after `undo`
image::UndoRedoState3.png[width=250, align=center]

NOTE: If the `currentCommandPointer` is at index -1, pointing to no command,
then there are no previous command to undo. The `undo` command uses
`Model#canUndoCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will
return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram for undo command
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[width=600, align=center]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X)
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#getRedoCommand()`,
which shifts the `currentCommandPointer` once to the right, pointing to
the previously undone Command, and executes the redo command from
`ReversibleCommand#getRedoCommand()`.

NOTE: If the `currentCommandPointer` is at index `commandHistoryList.size() - 1`,
pointing to the latest command, then there are no undone command to redo.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCommand()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform
the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `help`.
Commands that do not modify the model, such as `help`,
will usually not call `Model#commitCommand()`,`Model#getUndoCommand()` or
`Model#getRedoCommand()`. Thus, the `commandHistoryList` remains unchanged as
shown in the figure below.

.State of CommandHistory after `help`
image::UndoRedoState4.png[width=250, align=center]

Step 6. The user executes `set lp/7`, which calls `Model#commitCommand()`.
Since the `currentCommandPointer` is not pointing at the end of the `commandHistoryList`,
all commands after the `currentCommandPointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the
`add t/Animal Farm ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

.State of CommandHistory after `set lp/7`
image::UndoRedoState5.png[width=250, align=center]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

.Activity diagram for committing Command
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[width=200, align=center]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire catalog.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

Considering our target audience, community libraries, which may be poor. They might
be not able to afford a large amount of data storage. As a library may contain many
books, borrowers and loans, storing a state of application for each command can be
memory intensive. Hence, we chose to implement Alternative 1 so as to reduce the amount
of memory usage.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the commands for undo and redo.
** Pros: Only need to maintain one data structure.
** Cons: Harder for new developers to understand the mechanism for undo and redo.
* **Alternative 2:** Use two stacks to store a list of undoable and redoable commands.
** Pros: Easy for future developers to understand as there are two separate stacks to keep track of the command to undo and redo.
** Cons: Additional time required to add and pop from the stack.

We chose alternative 1 as it is easier to maintain a single data structure and it is
faster compared to alternative 2.

// end::undo/redo[]

=== Generate Loan Slip feature
// tag::printLoanSlip[]
==== Details of Implementation

The printing of loan slip feature is facilitated by `LoanSlipUtil`.
Essentially, `LoanSlipUtil` implements the following operations:

* `LoanSlipUtil#mountLoan()` -- Mounts a loan in the current loan session.
* `LoanSlipUtil#clearSession()` -- Clears the loan session by unmounting all loans.
* `LoanSlipUtil#createLoanSlipInDirectory()` -- Creates a pdf version of the mounted loans as a single loan slip, saved in the loan_slips folder.

Given below is the sequence diagram of the generation of loan slip during the loan of a book.

.Sequence Diagram for the generation of a loan slip
image::LoanSlipGeneration.png[width=500, align=center]
{nbsp} +

The sequence diagram above is described by the following sequence of events:
****
. `LoanCommand` is executed
. `LoanCommand` retrieves the `Book` and the `Borrower` to create a new `Loan`
. `LoanCommand` mounts the new loan in `LoanSlipUtil`
. `Storage` component creates and saves a new PDF in a saved folder
. `Logic` component opens the newly generated `LoanSlipDocument`
. `Logic` component clears the session in `LoanSlipUtil`
****

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to create and use an instance of a `LoanSlipDocument`.

* **Alternative 1 :** Use the `LoanSlipDocument` constructor directly.
** Pros: Will be straightforward to implement.
** Cons: The `Logic` component and the `LoanCommand` object needs to know all the methods of `LoanSlipDocument` to be able to create a loan slip.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a Facade class `LoanSlipUtil` to facilitate creation of `LoanSlipDocument`.
** Pros: The `Logic` component and the `LoanCommand` object can now use the full functionality of `LoanSlipDocument` via the static class `LoanSlipUtil` without knowing the internal implementation of `LoanSlipDocument`.
** Cons: There is more code to be written and maintained.

*We have decided to go with Alternative 2* as it *decouples* the code, making it easier to modify in the future.
On the contrary, Alternative 1 will introduce unnecessary dependencies between classes, thereby *increasing coupling* and *reducing maintainability*.

===== Aspect: Implementation to allow extension (loan multiple books at one go).

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Mount a loan in `LoanSlipUtil` for each book.
** Pros: Will be able to mount multiple loans using `LoanSlipUtil` before generating all loans in a single loan slip.
** Cons: Will require more code when mounting loans in the Facade class.
* **Alternative 2:** Re-create `LoanSlipDocument` whenever a new loan comes in.
** Pros: Will only need to make adjustments to `Logic` component to contain an `Optional<LoanSlipDocument>` field and update when a new `Loan` comes in.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle as the Logic class will now have to change if we change the implementation of `LoanSlipDocument`.

*We have decided to go with Alternative 1* as it allows us to have flexible code that is *easily extendable*. Furthermore,
it adheres to good programming practices as compared to Alternative 2, which *violates the Single Responsibility Principle*.
// end::printLoanSlip[]

// tag::bookLoaningFeatures[]

=== Book loaning feature

==== Details of Implementation

The functionalities and commands associated with the book loaning feature are `loan`, `return`, `pay` and `renew`.
This feature set is mainly facilitated by the `Loan` association class between a `Book` and a `Borrower`.

The object diagram at the state when a book is just loaned out can be seen below.

.Loan object diagram after a new Loan is created
image::LoanObjectDiagram.png[width=800, align=center]

At that instant shown in the diagram, the `Borrower` with `BorrowerId` K0789 currently has a `Book` with `SerialNumber` B00456 loaned out.
The `Loan` associated with this book loan, with `LoanId` L000123, is stored in the `LoanRecords` class of the model component.
Both the `Book` and `Borrower` objects also have access to this `Loan` object.

In each `Loan` object, only the `BorrowerId` of the `Borrower` and `SerialNumber` of the `Book` is stored to reduce
circular dependency. The `LoanRecords` class stores all the `Loan` objects tracked by LiBerry in a HashMap, where the key is its `LoanId`.

The immutability of each object is supported to ensure the correctness of undo and redo functionality.

===== Loaning

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a loan command.

.Activity diagram when a loan command is entered
image::LoaningActivityDiagram.png[width=580, align=center]

After `LoanCommand#execute(model)` is called, this series of checks shown in the above diagram is done to determine if
the book can be loaned to the currently served borrower.

When a book is successfully loaned out to a borrower, a new `Loan` object is created. The `LoanId` is automatically generated according
to the number of loans in the `LoanRecords` object in the model. The `startDate` is also automatically set to today's date.
The `endDate` is automatically set according to the loan period set in the user settings. This `Loan` object is added to
`LoanRecords` through the call to `Model#addLoan(loan)`.

The new `Borrower` instance is created by copying the details of the borrower from the original object, and also with this `Loan`
object being added into its `currentLoanList`. The new borrower object then replaces the old borrower object in the
`BorrowerRecords` object in the model. These two steps are done through the method call to `Model#servingBorrowerNewLoan(loan)`.
The new `Book` instance is also created by copying the details of the original book object, and likewise, with this `Loan` object added into it.
Similarly, the new book object replaces the old book object in the `Catalog` object in the model through the call to
`Model#setBook(bookToBeLoaned, loanedOutBook)`. These were done to support the immutability of the objects.

===== Returning

When a loaned out book is successfully returned by a borrower, the associated `Loan` object is moved from the borrower's
`currentLoanList` to `returnedLoanList`. Inside the book object, this `Loan` object is also removed. Inside this loan
object, the `returnDate` is set to today's date. The `remainingFineAmount` of this loan object is also
calculated based on the daily fine increment set in the user settings.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement is also done to support immutability. The `return` command is supported by the
methods `Model#setBook(bookToBeReturned, returnedBook)`, `Model#servingBorrowerReturnLoan(returningLoan)` and
`Model#updateLoan(loanToBeReturned, returnedLoan)`, which updates the `Catalog`, `BorrowerRecords` and `LoanRecords`
in the model respectively.

===== Paying fines

When a fine amount is successfully paid by a borrower through the call to `Model#payFines(amountInCents)`,
the `remainingFineAmount` and `paidFineAmount` of the loans in the borrower's `returnedLoanList` is updated accordingly.
The fine amount is tracked individually inside each loan object instead of as a variable inside the `Borrower` instance
that stores the total fine amount incurred by that borrower.
This is done to support the ease of extension in the future.
For example, the total fine each book has garnered can be easily calculated.

Similarly, the creation of new objects for replacement is also done to support immutability.

===== Renewing

The following sequence diagram illustrates the series of method calls when a `RenewCommand` is executed to renew book(s).

.Sequence diagram illustrating the execution of a RenewCommand
image::RenewSequenceDiagram.png[width=700, align=center]

As seen in the diagram, firstly, a list of books that can be renewed is obtained through the `RenewCommand#getRenewingBooks(model)` method.
For each `Loan` object associated with each book, a new instance is created with its original `renewCount` incremented by 1 and its
`dueDate` extended by the renew period set in the user settings. This is done through the method call to `Loan#renewLoan(extendedDueDate)`.
The call to `Book#renewBook(renewedLoan)` then returns a new instance of this book with its loan object updated.

The method calls to `Model#setBook(bookToBeRenewed, renewedBook)`, `Model#servingBorrowerRenewLoan(loanToBeRenewed, renewedLoan)`
and `Model#updateLoan(loanToBeRenewed, renewedLoan)` then updates the `Catalog`, `BorrowerRecords` and `LoanRecords` respectively.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: File storage of loans

Inside the model, for each current loan (loans that are not returned yet), the `Book`, the `Borrower` and the `LoanRecords`
point to the same `Loan` object. LiBerry's storage system is such that `Catalog` stores the books,
`BorrowerRecords` stores the borrowers and `LoanRecords` stores the loans. Thus, a decision was made to decide how these
loans are serialized and stored in the user's file system.

* **Alternative 1:** Save the entire `Loan` object in each book in `catalog.json` and save the entirety of every single `Loan`
object associated with a borrower in `borrowerrecords.json`. The `Loan` object is also duplicated in `loanrecords.json`.
** *Pros*: Easy to implement. No need to read storage files in a specific order.
** *Cons*: Storage memory size issues. The same information is duplicated and stored in all 3 storage files. +

* **Alternative 2 (selected choice):** Save only the `LoanId` of each `Loan` object in each book in `catalog.json`
and save a list of `LoanId` in each borrower in `borrowerrecords.json`. The whole `Loan` object is only saved in
`loanrecords.json`. When reading the storage files at the start of the application, `loanrecords.json` needs to be read
in first, before the borrowers and books can be read in as they would get the loan objects from the `LoanRecords` based
on their `LoanId` s.
** *Pros*: Uses less memory as only `LoanId` is stored for the books and borrowers, instead of the whole serialized loan objects.
** *Cons*: The reading of stored files have to be in a certain correct order. It must be ensured that the correct `Loan` object is referenced
after reading in `borrowerrecords.json` and `catalog.json`, and also every time a `Loan` object is updated. The method used to retrieve a `Loan` object from its `LoanId` must
also be fast enough as there can be hundreds of thousands of loans.

*Alternative 2* was chosen as this significantly reduced the file size of the storage files.
If alternative 1 was used, the memory needed to store each `Loan` object would be 3 times more compared to alternative 2.
Furthermore, `LoanRecords` could then also serve as a single source of truth for loan data.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support recording of loans in LoanRecords

* **Alternative 1:** Use a list data structure, such as an `ArrayList` to store the loans in the model component.
** *Pros*: Easy to implement. Easy to obtain insertion order of the loans and sort through the list.
** *Cons*: Slow to search for a `Loan` based on its `LoanId`, i.e., O(n) time, as the list must be traversed to find the
correct associated `Loan` object. The additional time taken adds up when reading the storage files during the starting
up of the application. Thus, it can make the application feel laggy and unresponsive at the start. +
{empty} +

* **Alternative 2 (selected choice):** Use a `HashMap` to store the loans, where the key is its `LoanId`.
** *Pros*: Fast to retrieve a `Loan` object based on its `LoanId`, i.e., O(1) time.
** *Cons*: Insertion order is not preserved. Have to traverse through all the loan objects in the HashMap to check their
`startDate` in order to obtain their insertion order.

*Alternative 2* was chosen as the application frequently needs to retrieve and access a `Loan` object based on its `LoanId`.
Thus, using a `HashMap` would greatly reduce the time needed for such operations. Moreover, the application rarely needed
to obtain the insertion order of a `Loan` object.

// end::bookLoaningFeatures[]

// tag::bookFinding[]
=== Book finding feature
The command for finding a book in the catalog is as follows: +
`find [NUMBER] { [t/TITLE] [a/AUTHOR] [g/GENRE]... [sn/BOOK_SN]] [-overdue] [-loaned] [-available] }`

==== Details of Implementation
ModelManager contains a `FilteredList` of `Books` (`filteredBooks`), which is used to display books on the LiBerry GUI. Book finding works by
starting converting the command string in to a `BookPredicate` object, then updating `filteredBooks` with that predicate.

The parsing of the command string to create the required `BookPredicate` object is done with the help of the `ArgumentTokenizer` object.
`ArgumentTokenizer` tokenizes the command string to generate an
`ArgumentMultimap`, which is internally a HashMap of predicate values paired to prefix keys. The `FindCommandParser`
then extracts all the values from the `ArgumentMultimap` prefix by prefix and building the predicate through functions
such as `setTitle()`, `setGenres()` `setLoanStatus` etc.

The diagram below shows a simplified command generation sequence of a 'find t/Animal Farm a/George' command,
starting from the CatalogParser

.Sequence Diagram showing the execution of a Find Command input
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width=840, align=center]

The `BookPredicate` class stores in its fields the specific values to match. Default values are mostly null, which will indicate that
there is no need to filter for that field. Below is an example.

.Object Diagram showing the fields present in an empty (left) and partially filled (right) BookPredicate object
image::BookPredicateObjectDiagram.png[height=300, align=center]

The figure above shows what happens when we are trying to filter for books with title 'harry' and 'Potter' that are loaned out,
showing up to 5 books only. Notice that the rest of the fields in the object are null.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Ensuring only 1 Loan Status Flag
In order for LiBerry to display only books that are *loaned*, *available* or *overdue*, flags are used. All flags have
the prefix `-`, and the `ArgumentTokenizer` is able to detect this. However, a user can technically enter more than 1
of such loan status flags eg. `-loaned -available`. This is not meaningful, as there can be multiple interpretations of
this statement. The user could be looking for both types of books (which will show every book), or books that are both
loaned and available (which will show none). To prevent such meaningless confusion, there is a need for only 1 such
flag to be accepted in the `BookPredicate`.

* *Alternative 1: Hard code a priority for loan status flags and accept the highest one when generating `BookPredicate`**
** *Pros*: Easy to implement, since Flags are implemented as `Enums`.
** *Cons*: Can be confusing to the reader as it is not clear why an unintended display is shown / why a certain priority exists.

* *Alternative 2 (Currently Used): Raise an exception whenever there are more than 1 loan status flags*
** *Pros*: Helps user clarify misconception of using more than 1 loan status flag
** *Cons*: Slightly more complicated code where the flags obtained from `ArgumentMultimap` has to be counted, checked and selected.

*Alternative 2* was chosen in the end as it conformed with the norms of directly informing the user of his
mistake through the use of exceptions and error messages.

===== Aspect: Limiting the Number of Books to Display
As users generally do not want to be flooded with information when using the find command, a display limit `[NUMBER]` is used. Users
can ask for a limited number of books to display. However, the `FilteredList` JavaFx class that is used to implement the list of
filtered books does not have an API that sets a hard limit on the number of books to show. A work-around has to be made.

* *Alternative 1: Create an new class that extends the JavaFx `FilteredList` class* that has a function that caps the
number of items in the inner `ObservableList`.
** *Pros*: Does not require a change in other parts of the code. Interface is simple and elegant.
** *Cons*: Hard to implement. Need to know the ins and outs of `FilteredList` and `ObservableList`.

* *Alternative 2 (Currently Used): Create a counter variable in `BookPredicate` that decrements after every passed test*
** *Pros*: Easy to implement.
** *Cons*: Not the cleanest and most developer friendly way of implementation.

*Alternative 2* was chosen instead as the extension of `FilteredList` would take too much time for the implementation of such a simple feature.
The cons of this choice will be compensated for in source code documentation to explain to developers how it works.
// end::bookFinding[]
//tag::toggleUi[]
=== Toggle GUI theme feature
==== Details of implementation
The `toggleui` command will cause switching of the LiBerry GUI between 'light' and 'dark' modes. The basic underlying mechanism
is to access the stylesheets of the `MainWindow` node, delete the previous stylesheet giving the current GUI theme, and adding
the stylesheet for the new GUI theme.

However, since some parts of the GUI are dynamically styled (such as the 'serve/normal mode' label on the top right, and
the 'loan box' detailing loan details to the right of each book card, as shown below), such a simple css file switch is unable to fully change all GUI elements effectively.
These dynamically styled elements will remain in 'light' mode colors while the rest of the app changes to 'dark' mode, causing an ugly
contrast.

.Dynamically styled GUI elements boxed in blue.
image::dynamicGuiElements.png[height=400, align=center]

The way that this was managed was through re-populating the panels every time the `toggleui` command is called. This forced the recreation of the
book cards with the correct stylesheet right from their instantiation, which will cause them to display the correct loan box.
//end::toggleUi[]

//tag::registerBorrower[]
=== Register borrower feature
==== Details of Implementation
The `register` borrower feature is facilitated by `BorrowerRecords`. The BorrowerRecords stores a list of borrowers,
representing the borrowers registered into the library system. The command to register a borrower into the library
system is as followed: +

`register n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL`

Given below is an activity diagram of a borrower being registered into the Borrower Records of the library.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Purpose of generating a borrower ID
Borrowers are issued with physical card by the library which they present to the librarian to borrower books.
The library card includes the borrower's ID which librarian will use to serve the borrowers.

===== Aspect: Generating a unique borrower ID
Every time a new borrower is being registered, the system will automatically generate a borrower ID for the borrower
which the borrower will have to use every time the borrower borrows books from the library.
Initially, what we proposed is that, every time a new borrower is being registered into the system, we find the size of
the list of borrowers, we add 1 and set it as the borrower ID of the new borrower.

Eg: There are 100 borrowers in the system. The new borrower's ID will be "K0101".

However, we decided to implement a new function, which is to allow borrowers to be removed from the library system.
Therefore, this method does not work anymore. So we decided to change to generate the new ID based on the first-found
available ID.
//end::registerBorrower[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

=== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* a librarian in a small town library that has to serve many library users (borrowers) quickly
* has a need to manage a significant number of books and borrowers
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Many people visit the neighborhood library to borrow books and also donate their books. There is
always a long queue in this small library and the librarian would have to type quickly to handle the long queue. LiBerry
can manage a library system faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
