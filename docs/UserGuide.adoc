== Introduction

StudyBuddyPro is a student application that aims to simplify the hassle of revision
by providing a suite of tools for effective revision.

StudyBuddyPro is optimized for students who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Moreover, StudyBuddyPro comes geared with pre-loaded features specially
catered for computing students. So whether you're a computing student getting
used to a CLI for the first time or if you're a CLI expert who wants to reap
the benefits of a fast typing speed, give StudyBuddyPro a try!

If you're interested, head over to the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#2-quick-start[Quick Start]
section to get started!

== Quick Start

NOTE: Please ensure you have Java 11 or above installed before proceeding!

1. Download the latest version of `StudyBuddyPro.jar` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/releases[here].

2. Place the file in the folder you want to set as the home directory. All data and
miscellaneous files associated with StudyBuddyPro will be placed in this folder.

3. Double-click `StudyBuddyPro.jar` to launch the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. If not, please
refer to the first question in the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#8-FAQ[FAQ]
for help!

4. Type a command in the command box execute it by pressing kbd:[Enter]. Refer to the
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#9-command-summary[Command Summary]
section for a quick overview of all the available commands!

== Command Format / Rules

Things noted here are standardization of the User Guide.
These points are absolute, unless stated otherwise in the specific section(s).

=== How to read the Command sections

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
E.g. `add t/TITLE` -> `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Midterm notes`.

* Items indicated in square brackets are optional, unless specified.
E.g `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/Midterm note tag/exam` or as `t/Midterm`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
E.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family`.

=== General rules for all commands

* All commands are written in English.

* Some command parameters are restricted to purely alphanumeric characters, while others are just required to not be
blank.

* Any indexes provided (denoted by '(index)' ) must be a positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...).

* All flashcards, notes, and cheatsheets can have a maximum of 10 tags.

* Only exact matches of any searches will be returned.
E.g. "noted" will return "noted" but not "note" or "notes"

* All searches, like `filter`, are case insensitive.
E.g. 'tag/cs2103t' will match 'tag/CS2103T' and `filter tag/important` will match `filter tag/IMPORTANT`

* If multiple inputs are given for a particular field, only the last valid input for the field is taken, unless the field allows multiple inputs.
E.g. `add q/this is a question a/this is an answer q/another question` -> the application will only take in `q/another question` as the input field for `question`.

== Global Commands

Global commands in StudyBuddyPro are commands that can be called regardless of which mode the user is currently in.

=== Entering the various modes of StudyBuddyPro: `switch`

Upon startup, you will be prompted to enter one of the modes before you can proceed.

==== Getting into Flashcard mode: `switch fc`

Switches the user to
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#5-flashcard-commands[Flashcard]
mode regardless of where the user is.

    Format: switch fc

==== Getting into Notes function: `switch notes`

Brings the user to
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#6-note-commands[Notes]
mode regardless of where the user is.

    Format: switch notes

==== Getting into CheatSheet function: `switch cs`

Brings the user to
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#7-cheatsheet-commands[CheatSheet]
mode regardless of where the user is.

    Format: switch cs

=== Viewing Help: `help`

[math] |  flashcards : 10 notes : 2 cheatsheets : 1
[pipelining] |  flashcards : 1 notes : 5 cheatsheets : 2
```

* The user can make use of taglist, to quickly see which tag they would like to view.

* The user is able to view how many flashcards, notes and cheatsheets respectively there are in each tag.

* The list of tags is also automatically sorted alphabetically.

* If there are no longer any items with the specified tag, the tag will be removed from this list.



=== Listing all StudyBuddyPro items by their tag : `filterall`

Lists all StudyBuddyPro items with matching tags in the application.

    Format: filterall tag/TAG [tag/TAG]...

Example usage:

    filterall tag/CS2100

Expected output:

```
Listing the whole StudyBuddyPro after filtering by tag(s) :
    CS2100
Flashcard: 6.
    Question: What is 101 Binary in its Decimal form?
    Answer: 5
    Title: BinaryQn
    Tags: [cs2100]
CheatSheet: 7.
    Title: cs2100 stuff
    Tags: [cs2100]
    Contents: [ 1. Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes simultaneously.]
        [ 2. Question: What is 101 Binary in its Decimal form?; Answer: 5 ]
Note: 5.
    Title: Pipelining Definition
    Content: Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes simultaneously.
    Tags: [cs2100]
Note Fragment: 6-2.
    Title: About Notes
    Content: highlighted
    Tags: [cs2100]
```

NOTE: 'Note Fragments' (as seen in the example above) are described further in the Notes section (see Section 6.1).

The user is also able to specify a multiple number of tags.
For example,

    filterall tag/CS2100 tag/difficult

will list all items that match all of the specified tags.

=== Clearing specific feature's data: `clear`

[WARNING]

Proceed with care when using this function!! Using the clear function will IMMEDIATELY clear ALL of the data depending on the mode you are in!

Clears the data in specific feature. Depending on the _mode_ that the user is in, the `clear` command will only clear the specific feature's data.

Example usage:

    clear

Expected output:

    Cleared all flashcards/notes/cheatsheets!

=== Clearing entire application's data: `clear all`

[WARNING]

Proceed with care when using this function!! Using the clear function will IMMEDIATELY clear ALL of the data in StudyBuddyPro!


Clears all the data in the application.

Example usage:

    clear all

Expected output:

    Cleared the entire StudyBuddyPro!

=== Exiting the application: `exit`

Checks if there are any remaining flashcards to revise for the day
or overdue flashcards to revise before exiting the application.

Example usage:

    exit

If there are flashcards due for revision today but no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Are you sure you want to exit? You still have the following flashcards overdue or left
to revise for today:
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
Type 'exit' again to exit the application!
```
If there are no flashcards due for revision today but there are overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Are you sure you want to exit? You still have the following flashcards overdue or left
to revise for today:
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
Type 'exit' again to exit the application!
```
If there are both flashcards due for revision today and overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Are you sure you want to exit? You still have the following flashcards overdue or left
to revise for today:
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 2 - What is 3 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
Type 'exit' again to exit the application!
```

* After any of the 3 scenarios above user can override the warning by entering the `exit` command again.

* If no remaining or overdue flashcards for revision found, application exits immediately.

* The user can use this feature to alleviate worries that they may forget to revise
the relevant content for the day - StudyBuddyPro will always double-check for you!


=== Editing a tag: `edit tag` (proposed in v2.0)

Edits a tag by the specified index.

    Format: edit tag/CURRENT tag/NEW

Example usage:

    edit tag/midterm tag/finals

Expected output:
```
Tag edited!
All items and contents in StudyBuddy tagged ‘midterm’ is replaced with tag ‘finals’.
```

This allows the user to easily modify the tags of all the items with a single command.

For instance, if the user has items that are tagged [cs2100] and [midterm], and the user wishes to make
use of such items to include in a cheatsheet for CS2100 finals, the user can input

    edit tag/midterm tag/finals

to conveniently change, for instance, all notes tagged with [midterm] to be tagged with [finals].

This then allows the user to more conveniently generate a cheatsheet for his/her final exams.

== Flashcard Feature

Sick and tired of cramming all your revision at the last minute? Why not give our
Flashcards feature a try! This feature can help you create your very own flashcards to
help you consistently revise. With our built-in reminder features and timetrial modes to
test yourself, use this feature and be on track to better revising habits today!

[IMPORTANT]
====
All the operations in this section assume that the user is in the _flashcard_ mode. To be sure
you are _flashcard_ mode, please ensure you used the `switch fc` command before this. Your
screen should now look like the one found in the screenshot below.
====

The user will be prompted again to confirm their deletion.

   Format: delete (index)

Example usage:

    delete 6

Expected output:
```
Are you sure you would like to delete the following flashcard?
    Title: Binary Question 1
    Tags: [cs2100]
    Please use `delete 6` again to confirm your deletion..
```

[IMPORTANT]

Inputting invalid commands will *NOT* offer another prompt to the user.
For example, calling `delete 3`, then an `invalid command` and then `delete 3` again will immediately delete the 3rd item without a prompt.

Upon keying in `delete 6` again, then the flashcard will be deleted.

Expected output:

```
Deleted Flashcard:  Title: Binary Question 1
    Tags: [cs2100]
```

=== Time Trial: `timetrial`

Starts a time trial for flashcards with tag <TAG> for <TIME> seconds per flashcard.

    Format: timetrial tag/TAG...

Example usage:

    timetrial cs2103tuml hard

Expected output:
```
Time trial started
```

* At least one tag must be specified.
* If more than one tag is specified, selects all flashcards that contains all of the specified tags.
* Default <TIME> will be 5 seconds.
* Answer will be flashed for 3 seconds.
* If a command (other than `show`) is inputted during the time trial, the time trial will be terminated and the inputted
command will be executed.
* Executing `show` will reveal the answer of the flashcard in advance, but will not terminate the time trial.


=== Listing by tags: `filter`

* Filters the flashcard library by the user specified tag(s).
* The user must specify at least one tag.
* The user is able to specify multiple tags.
* Flashcards that match all of the specified tags will be displayed.

    Format: filter tag/TAG [tag/TAG]...

Example usage:

    filter tag/difficult

Expeted output:

    Filter flashcards by tag(s) :
    [difficult]
    8. Question: What is 1+1?
        Title: Basic addition
        Tags: [difficult]
    10. Question: What is 2x3?
        Title: Maths
        Tags: [difficult][important]

=== Find out what flashcards to revise today, or ones you may have missed: `remind`

Reminds the user regarding the flashcards due for revision today and the flashcards
overdue for revision. Automatically suggests a new date the flashcard should next be
viewed at for optimal learning. These increments scale with time i.e. suggested viewing
dates are closer at the start and spread further after more viewings.

[NOTE] StudyBuddyPro only marks a flashcard as revised and removes it from the due and
overdue flashcard list when you see the flashcard's _answer_ not just its question! For
example, simply using the `view` command without the `show` command to reveal the flashcard's
answer will not trick the system. Sorry, it's for your own good!

Example usage:

    remind

If no flashcards due for revision today and no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Well done - No due or overdue flashcards!
```

If there are flashcards due for revision today but no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
```

If there are no flashcards due for revision today but there are overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
```

If there are both flashcards due for revision today and overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 2 - What is 3 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
```

== Notes Feature:

[IMPORTANT]
====
All the operations in this section assume that the user is in the _notes_ mode.
====

=== Creating a note: `add`

Adds a note from user input with title `TITLE` and content `CONTENT`. The title of the note cannot be a duplicate
of an existing note title.

```
Format: add t/TITLE c/CONTENT [tag/TAG]...
```

Example usage:
```
add t/Pipelining Definition c/Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes simultaneously. tag/cs2100
```

Expected output:
```
New note added:
    Title: Pipelining Definition
    Content: Pipelining is a process where a processor executes multiple processes simultaneously.
    Tags: [cs2100]

The added Note has no detected note fragment tags!
```

More advanced usage: Tagging of note fragments is also supported. The note fragment tagging is added at the
same time as the note is created.

Note fragment tags are added with content `FRAGMENT_CONTENT`, at least one tag
`FRAGMENT_TAG`, and any number of additional tags `ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENT_TAG`:

```
Format (within CONTENT): /* C/FRAGMENT_CONTENT TAG/FRAGMENT_TAG [TAG/ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENT_TAG]... */
```

IMPORTANT: The format for note fragment content is 'C/', not 'c/', and the format for note fragment tags is 'TAG/', not
'tag/'.

WARNING: If the format is not followed correctly, the note fragment tag will simply not be added (but the note will
still be added). StudyBuddyPro will assume that the user has typed the tags correctly.

In the following example, two note fragment tags are added to the same note fragment:

Example usage:
```
add t/About Notes c/Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed. tag/about
```

Expected output:

```
New note added:
	Title: About Notes
	Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed.
	Tags: [about]

Note fragment tags detected:
	Title: About Notes
	Content: highlighted
	Tags: [important][highlight]
```

This adds a note with content "Notes can be highlighted if needed.", and a note fragment tag with content
"highlighted" and two tags "cs2100" and "important".

NOTE: The spaces around the syntax elements of '/\*', 'C/' etc are part of the syntax. For example, if a note
fragment tag looks like this: '/* C/highlighted TAG/important */if needed', then the resultant Note will look like
this: 'highlightedif needed'.

Multiple note fragment tags are allowed. These do not interfere with the other tags of the Note.

IMPORTANT: Overlapping note fragment tags are not allowed.

NOTE: Note fragment tags can be used for filtering notes (see Section 6.6), or filtering globally (see Section 4.3).
For a clearer visualization of note fragments, compare the `view` (see Section 6.3) and `viewraw` (see Section 6.4)
commands.

=== Deleting a note: `delete`

Deletes the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`.

The user will be prompted once to confirm their deletion.

```
Format: delete (index)
```

Example usage:
```
delete 3
```

Expected output:

```
Are you sure you would like to delete the following note?

    Title: About Notes
    Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/highlight TAG/important */ if needed.
    Tags: [about]
    Please use `delete 3` again to confirm your deletion.
```

Upon using `delete 3` again, then the note will be deleted.
```
Deleted note:
    Title: About Notes
    Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
    Tags: [about]
```

[IMPORTANT]

Inputting invalid commands will *NOT* offer another prompt to the user.
For example, calling `delete 3`, then an `invalid command` and then `delete 3` again will immediately delete the 3rd item without a prompt.

=== Viewing a note: `view`

Views the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`. If the note contains any note fragment tags, those tags will be hidden.

NOTE: To view the note with its note fragment tags, use the `viewraw` command instead (see Section 6.4).

```
Format: view (index)
```

Example usage:
```
view 3
```

Expected output:

```
Viewing note:
    Title: About Notes
    Content: Notes can be highlighted if needed.
    Tags: [about]
```

=== Viewing a raw note: `viewraw`

Views the note of index `NOTE_INDEX`. The note is shown exactly as written, including all note fragment tags.

```
Format: viewraw (index)
```

Example usage:
```
viewraw 3
```

Expected output:

```
Viewing raw note:
    Title: About Notes
    Content: Notes can be /* C/highlighted TAG/cs2100 TAG/important */ if needed.
    Tags: [about]
```

=== Listing notes: `list`

Lists all notes found in StudyBuddyPro.

```
Format: list
```

Expected output:

```

    Title: Pipelining Definition
    Content: Pipelining is a process where a /* C/processor TAG/mips */ executes multiple processes simultaneously.
    Tags: [cs2100]
2.
    Title: UML Diagrams
    Content: UML Diagrams help with visualizing project structure.
    Tags: [cs2103t]
```

NOTE: Notes will be labeled with indices '1', '2' etc. Note fragment tags will not be listed along with the notes. To
visualize specific note fragment tags, use the `filter` command (see Section 6.6).

=== Filtering by tags: `filter`

* Filters the note library by the user specified tag(s).
* The user must specify at least one tag, and can specify multiple tags.
* Notes that match all of the specified tags will be displayed.
* Note fragment tags containing all of the specified tags will also be displayed, even if their parent note is
not tagged.

```
Format: filter tag/TAG [tag/TAG]...
```

Example usage:
```
filter tag/difficult
```

Expected output:
```
Filter notes by tag(s) :
    [difficult]
    2. Title: Tough Math
        Content: 1 + 2 is 3.
        Tags: [difficult]

NOTE: Notes will be labeled with indices '1', '2' etc. Note fragment tags will be labeled with '1-1', '1-2', '2-1' etc.
'5-1' means 'the first note fragment tag in the fifth note'.

=== Editing a note: `edit` (Coming in v2.0)

Edits a note's title, content, or tags. The note will be referred to by their original title `ORIGINAL_TITLE`.

* The user can specify one of the optional fields to edit.

```
Format: edit ORIGINAL_TITLE [t/TITLE] [c/CONTENT] [tag/TAG]...
```

Example usage:
```
edit Pipelining Definition t/Pipelined Definition tag/cs2100finals
