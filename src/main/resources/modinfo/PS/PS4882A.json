    "description": "This seminar studies the effects of globalization on security. It considers the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, crime, environmental degradation, migration, public health, and other issues. How do states and non-state actors deal with transnational threats? What are the implications of these issues for traditional understandings of sovereignty and non-intervention? What is the role of international institutions and global civil society in responding to these threats?",
