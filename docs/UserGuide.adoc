== Introduction

Extremely Loud and Intelligent Student Assistant (ELISA) is for students who *wants to have an intelligent companion that keeps track of tasks and give friendly reminders on when to take breaks*. More importantly, ELISA is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ELISA can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `elisa.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ELISA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd item shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

.Command Guidelines
|===
|Guidelines: |Description: |Correct usage:
|Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user | If given `task DESCRIPTION` description is to be provided. |`task shower`
|All flags *MUST* have a _space_ after them | `task shower -d10.min.later` is *incorrect*. It should be `task shower -d 10.min.later` | `task shower -d 10.min.later`
|Flags in square brackets are optional | If given `task DESCRIPTION [-t TAG]` tag is optional | `task shower` `task shower -t clean`
|Flags can be in any order, given that they are accepted by the command | If given `task DESCRIPTION [-d DATETIME] [-r REMINDER]` -r can come before -d | `task shower -d 1.hour.later -r 30.min.later` `task shower -r 30.min.later -d 1.hour.later`
|Flags must not be repeated in the same input | `task shower -p high -p low` is *incorrect* as -p appears twice | `task shower -p high`
