Specifically, we will study the strategic, economic, financial and governance issues associated with M&A transactions, perform valuation analyses of different transactions, as well as learn how to assess whether a transaction is properly valued. Ultimately, this course will provide the students with a framework for analyzing M&A transactions, including understanding strategic rationale, valuation methodologies, deal structures and bidding strategies.",
