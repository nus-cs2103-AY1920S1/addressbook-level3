    "description": "Religion plays a fundamental role in political outcomes. It influences voting, violence, public goods provision as well as broader processes in state formation such as democratization and capitalism. We will study a proportion of the theoretical and empirical literature that examines how religion influences political actors, institutions and outcomes and how political processes influence religious behaviour. The empirical literature will be primarily drawn from South Asia.",
