**The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)** is a desktop appeal management app for module appeal administrators.
MAMS aims to fuse a Command Line Interface (CLI) style command input with a triple-pane GUI for easy navigation of appeals, module information, and student
particulars all in a single display.
MAMS provides a complete suite of tools for intuitive navigation of the comprehensive data display and
resolving appeals (_for feature details, please refer to User Guide_).
MAMS is written primarily in Java, and features a GUI created with JavaFX, with CSS used to augment the GUI for improved user experience. It has about 13 kLoC.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add or remove modules from students*
** What it does: It allows the user to register students for modules via addmod command. It also allows user to drop students from module via the removemod command
** Justification: This feature is one of the fundamental commands that is required by Appeal admins to resolve appeals made by students. One of the most common requests made is to take up modules or drop modules.
** Highlights: Many logical checks are required before a addmod command can be executed. E.g. student cannot exceed workload/module cannot exceed quota limit.
