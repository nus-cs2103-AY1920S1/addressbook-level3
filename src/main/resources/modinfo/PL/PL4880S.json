    "description": "Programme evaluation is essential in the social service sector. It helps policy makers and practitioners to determine whether a programme, for instance a psychological intervention, fundamentally improves its clients\u2019 wellbeing. Through this systematic process, evaluators identify opportunities for improvements and make recommendations to programme owners for subsequent implementation. This module aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills to conduct a simple programme evaluation within the social service sector. Students will also learn to appreciate the challenges of conducting real world research and develop strategies to overcome these challenges.",
