    "description": "This module aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the health needs of adult clients living in the community. A systems approach has been chosen to provide a holistic framework as the module is underpinned by the belief that health is shaped by biological, psychosocial, politico-economical dimensions. An emphasis is placed on using clinical decision making skills and techniques to perform comprehensive health needs assessment of clients. This module builds upon the existing communication skills of the students to develop enhanced communication skills when dealing with complex and challenging situations. During the work-based practice, students will have the opportunity to further develop and apply knowledge and skills learnt in the module.",
