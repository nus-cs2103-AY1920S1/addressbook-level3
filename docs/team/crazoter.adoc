== PROJECT: NurseTraverse

---

== Overview

NurseTraverse is a desktop application designed to help community nurses manage all the data they may need, including visit management, appointment scheduling, and importing and exporting of patient data.
The user interacts with the app using a CLI (Command Line Interface) enhanced with an autocomplete functionality and ability to undo and redo commands. The app has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.
NurseTraverse is built by me and 4 other students.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage visits*
** What it does: allows the user to manage their visits to their patients. They can create their own "checklist" of things to do for each patient, record said data during a visit and view data from previous visits.
** Justification: This feature has been identified as a required feature by user stories https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/5[#5], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/6[#6] and https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F10-1/main/issues/25[#25] and will provide significant value-add by allowing users to manage visit data directly.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds a new feature for the user. From a design perspective, it was challenging as there was a need to make the use cases and commands usable and efficient while keeping the workload manageable. The implementation too was challenging as it is a rather big feature involving changes to existing commands and the creation of new commands.
** Credits: No code or ideas were referenced to outside of this application (beyond code that already exists within _Address Book 3_).

== Visit Management
====
*Visit Management*

As a community nurse, you will often make home visits to your patients. When you are visiting a patient, there is often a todo list that you will have to do as well as information that you will have to record. This can now be done using the app. This section describes the features that will allow you to start a visit, keep track of your tasks during a visit, finish a visit and view information recorded during previous visits.

====

=== Starting a Visit `visit-start`

You can begin a visit by using `visit-start`. When you visit a patient and you want to record in the application that you are visiting said patient, you can use this feature to begin the visit for that patient (which will unlock the `visit-now-update` and `visit-now-finish` commands that will be applied to that visit). You can only have one ongoing visit at any point in time. This ongoing visit can be viewed in the "Current Visit" tab.

`visit-start` uses the patient's Visit Todos to populate a checklist of Visit Tasks for you to use (these Visit Tasks are simply referred to as "tasks"). Visit Todos are described in further detail under <<VisitHowTo>>.

Format: `visit-start PATIENT_INDEX`

****
* Begins a visit for the patient specified at `PATIENT_INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list of patients displayed by `pat-list` or `pat-find`.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* There can only be one ongoing visit at any point in time; if there is already an ongoing visit this command does nothing.
* This command does not bring up the "Current Visit" tab. You will have to manually click the tab.
* You cannot delete the patient who you are currently visiting.
* You can update the details of the patient you are currently visiting, but changes to his/her Visit Todos will not affect the ongoing visit's Visit Tasks.
****

Examples:

* `visit-start 1` +
Starts a visit for the 1st patient in the patient list.
