    "description": "This course focuses on matters that are truly linguistic. After separating linguistic problems from ones that should be studied in other fields, the course introduces students to genuinely scientific study of human language. More specifically, by (critically) reading Radford 2009, the course provides a concise and clear introduction to current work in syntactic theory, drawing on the key concepts of Chomsky\u2019s Minimalist Program. By looking at data mainly from English, it will also introduce students to quite a few linguistic mysteries.",
