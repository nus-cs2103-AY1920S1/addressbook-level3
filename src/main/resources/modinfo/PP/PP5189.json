    "description": "This module will help the student to understand better the practice of governance and learn how to build better and effective governance. The student will be exposed to insights and practices of governance and the delivery of public services that draw from examples from across different countries. The emphasis is on the practices of better and effective governance, rather than the theory. Each week, students will discuss an aspect of governance and then offer their own thoughts on the subject using their country (or another country that they have intimate knowledge of) as setting. Towards the end of the course, the student will propose solutions that may help towards achieving better governance in their country.",
