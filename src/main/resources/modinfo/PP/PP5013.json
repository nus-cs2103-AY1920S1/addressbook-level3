    "description": "21st century managers encounter brand new types of ethical issues, including the blurring between public and private time in new media usage, tensions created by increasing diversity and internationalization, security risks and ethical risks created by big data and artificial intelligence, and the advent of virtual whistleblowing. The module will examine the kind of analyses required, the difficulties involved, and what strategies are likely to be effective. It also examines where unethical behavior comes from and how ethical behavior can be incentivized; and the link between compliance, awareness and values.",
