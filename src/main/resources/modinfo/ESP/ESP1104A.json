    "description": "This module introduces students to the fundamental electronic principles of sensor systems for a variety of different disciplines. Particular emphasis will be given to circuits that are used in research and development, such as sensor amplifiers, filters, and data-acquisition. The module has both analogue and digital circuit principles, and involves project activities that involve hands-on construction of sensors, their circuits and translating their signals into digital data on to a computer.",
