    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for the BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, wind and percussion. Normally undertaken in the third year of study, this module forms an initial capstone for instrumental Majors on the BMus programme, serving otherwise as the final capstone for those undertaking instrumental studies as a second major. The module continues and consolidates processes initiated in previous semesters, manifesting their outcome in a shorter professional level performance of approximately half an hour\u2019s duration (usually either a recital and piano-accompanied concerto performance). The performance should demonstrate the emerging professional capacities of each student.",
