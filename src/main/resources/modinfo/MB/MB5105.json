    "description": "This modules aims at teaching the basic principles of soft lithography techniques that are classically used by biologists. Although clean room techniques will be presented to help understand the whole fabrication process and limitation, a strong emphasis will be placed on post processing that is often performed at the bench such as surface treatment, protein adsorbtion, UV treatment, polymerization. The modules will be articulated around i- a theoretical description of fabrication process, polymerization schemes and surface treatment scheme. ii- Practical fabrication work at the bench in small groups. We will study both 'classic' devices and processes as well as 'custom' devices proposed by students.",
