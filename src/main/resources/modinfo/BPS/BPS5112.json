    "description": "This is a studio-based module that synthesizes the theoretical and practical aspects of building performance and detailed design development, bringing sustainable design concepts and elements to the forefront. The needs for sustainable design and its integration into a holistic performing building will be a key principle of studio learning. Design decision support using simulation tools will be brought to life in studio environment in the realization of holistic sustainable building. Simulation tools will be used for thermal, ventilation, IAQ, lighting and acoustics. Current sustainable building assessment techniques will be applied. Studio will be jointly conducted by academics and leading industry practitioners, particular focus will be given to sustainable building design covering both new build and retrofit of existing building.",
