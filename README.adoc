* What is _TravelPal_? First and foremost, it is a cross-platform desktop application for those who love to plan and micromanage their travels!
* It includes various features to help in planning the trip beforehand, such as an itinerary planner, a pre-trip inventory manager, bookings and expense manager.
* During the trip, there is also an inbuilt diary application that allows the user to record details of the trip, and a contacts manager to store important contacts related to the trip.

* In addition, itâ€™s primary preferred form of input from the user is the Command Line Interface (CLI), but it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for those who like to use alternative inputs, such as a mouse. Jump to the quick start to get started!
