    "description": "Multi\u2010stressed families often termed resistant, dysfunctional and hard to work with have been the main focus of social work practice. This module offers a multilevel intervention approach in working with these families. Using a systemic assessment of multigenerational influences, the module will explore the meanings and impact of these events for the family. The various therapeutic modalities, skills and interventions (including family assessment tools) will also be discussed, with a primary focus on strengths and resilience. The need for community networking, collaboration and case management will also be emphasised. Students will also be familiarised with the various polices and resources available to help such families in the community. Comparisons with models of practice from other countries will help to develop critical thinking about how such families are being helped in Singapore.",
