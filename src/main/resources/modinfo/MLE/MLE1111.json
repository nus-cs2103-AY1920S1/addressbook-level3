    "description": "This module is a pure materials science and materials engineering module, which focuses on foundation and core concepts that practicing materials engineer must know. A number of applications will be used to help emphasise the importance of this core knowledge. Major topics covered in depth include: Atomic structure and bonding; structures, crystal systems, crystalline, noncrystalline and semicrystalline materials; Imperfections in Solids covering point defects, line defects, surface defects and grain boundaries; Fundamental concepts into mechanical properties of materials, involving statics and mechanics of materials, beam structures and beam bending will be covered here.",
