    "description": "This module examines the treaties used by States to protect the interests of their investors when making investments abroad and to attract foreign investment into host economies. It will pay particular attention to investor-State arbitration under investment treaties, which is increasingly becoming widespread in Asia and a growing part of international legal practice. It will examine not only the legal and theoretical underpinnings of these treaties and this form of dispute settlement, but also their practical application to concrete cases and their utility as a tool of government policy.",
