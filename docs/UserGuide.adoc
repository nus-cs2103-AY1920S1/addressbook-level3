== Introduction

Mark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop application for managing
bookmarks*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mark
can get your bookmark organisation and note-taking done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Move on to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

=== Installing Mark

Here are a few steps to get you started on Mark: +

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mark.
.  Double-click the file to start the application. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
//TODO: update UI screenshot
+
.GUI for Mark
image::Ui.png[]
+
// TODO: move this part to <<Using Mark>>
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all bookmarks
* *`folder Tutorials`* : creates a folder named `Tutorials`
* *`add u/https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 n/Pro Git f/Tutorials`* : adds a bookmark
named `Pro Git` to Mark
* *`delete 3`* : deletes the 3rd bookmark shown in the current bookmark list
* *`exit`* : exits the application

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mark

This section offers an overview of Mark's layout so that you can locate information more easily.

There are three main areas in Mark:

. A __command box__ and __result display box__ at the top of the screen
. A __bookmark list__ on the left of the screen
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the right side of the screen

// TODO: describe properly (this is very 'functional' but may not be user-friendly)
The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the *_result display box_*, immediately below the command box.

.The command box and result display box
image::ui-screenshots/CommandBox.png[]

The *_bookmark list_* shows details about the bookmarks in Mark.

.The bookmark list
image::ui-screenshots/BookmarkList.png[]

The *_main viewing area_* shows one of three available tabs at any point in time.
Mark has three [[Tabs]] tabs: **Dashboard**, **Online** and **Offline**.

* The **Dashboard** tab contains information about reminders, favorite bookmarks,
folders, and autotags in Mark.
+

====
*Command Format*

This document uses the following notation to describe command formats:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
E.g. In the command format `*add* u/URL`, `URL` is a parameter which can be used as `*add* u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
E.g `u/URL [t/TAG]` can be used as
`u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg t/NUS` or as `u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Default values for optional items are specified with an `=` symbol. +
E.g. When `u/URL [t/TAG=CS2103T]` is specified in the command format, the default value for the tag is `CS2103T` if not
it is not provided.
* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. +
E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/module`,
`t/module t/read-later` etc.
* Parameters can be used in any order unless otherwise specified. +
E.g. if the command specifies `u/URL n/NAME`, `n/NAME u/URL` is also acceptable.

'''

=== General

The following commands carry out general operations in Mark.

==== Viewing help: *`help`*
Displays a link that you can copy to this page.

Format: *`help`*

==== Switching tabs: *`tab`*

You can switch the current app view to a another <<Tabs, tab>> with this command.

Just provide an index as specified below. For your convenience, you can also use keywords `dash`, `on` or `off` instead of an index.

Format: `*tab* INDEX` or `*tab* KEYWORD`

// How to use the command (what should you see) i.e. before/after
For example:

* You want to go to the dashboard. So you type `*tab* 1` and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::ui-screenshots/TabUI1.png[]
* You see the dashboard tab instead of the previously showing online tab.
+
image::ui-screenshots/TabUi2.png[]

Parameter constraints:
****
* `INDEX` is `1`, `2` or `3`, which correspond to the
<<Dashboard,Dashboard>>, Online, and Offline tabs respectively.
* `KEYWORD` is `dash`, `on` or `off`, which correspond to the
<<Dashboard,Dashboard>>, Online, and Offline tabs respectively.
****

Other examples:

* `*tab* on` +
Goes to the Online tab which is a web view.

* `*tab* 3` +
Goes to the Offline tab which shows the offline copy of bookmarks.

==== Undoing previous commands: *`undo`*
// tag::undo-command[]
If you mistakenly enter a command that permanently changes Mark, do not worry, you can always use `undo` to
rectify the mistake! This command restores Mark to the state before the given number of previous undoable commands were
executed.

Format: `*undo* [STEP=1]`

For example:

* When you accidentally delete a wrong bookmark and you want to bring it back. There is no
need for you to manually add that bookmark back as `undo` will do the magic for you. Just input `undo`
in the command box, the deleted bookmark will reappear in your bookmark list.

* Suppose you have entered two `delete` commands, `*delete* 1` and `*delete* 2`, and now you
want to get back both bookmarks, a possible way is enter `undo` twice. Besides, Mark also
offers an alternative where you can just type `undo 2` to undo these two commands.

Parameter constraints:
****
* `STEP` must be a positive integer `1`, `2`, `3`, ...
* Undoable commands include commands that modify the bookmark list, folders,
reminders or annotations, which includes `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `reminder`,
`folder`, `annotate`, etc).
****

// end::undo-command[]

==== Redoing previously undone commands: *`redo`*
// tag::redo-command[]
This command reverses the given number of undone actions.

Format: `*redo* [STEP=1]`

Examples:

* `*redo*` +
Reverses the most recent `*undo*` command.

* `*delete* 1` +
`*delete* 2` +
`*undo* 2` +
`*redo* 2` +
The `*redo* 2` command restores the bookmark list to the state before the `*undo* 2` command was executed.
You will see the two bookmarks you just recovered get deleted again.

Parameter constraints:
****
* `STEP` must be a positive integer `1`, `2`, `3`, ...
****
// end::redo-command[]

// tag::exportcommand[]
[[exporting-bookmarks]]
==== Exporting bookmarks: *`export`*

This command exports Mark data to a specified file on the hard disk. The saved file is
identical in format to the data file `mark.json` and can be used to save back-up copies
of Mark data.

Note that Mark data are automatically saved in the hard disk after any command
that changes the data, so if you do not need outdated Mark data, there is no need to
save manually.

Format: `*export* [FILENAME]`

For example:

* If you want a quick way to save your current bookmarks before modifying them,
you can input `*export* myBookmarks` into the command box.
+
image::ui-screenshots/ExportCommandUi1.png[]

* Mark displays a confirmation message, and you can verify that your Mark data
has been exported to the folder `/data/bookmarks/myBookmarks.json`.
+
// not sure if we should show a screenshot of the directory
image::ui-screenshots/ExportCommandUi2.png[]

Parameter constraints:
****
* {blank}
+
`FILENAME` should not include the file extension. E.g. `myBookmarks` and not
`myBookmarks.json`
* `FILENAME` should consist of only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and/or underscores.
* The data file is saved at `[applicationHome]/data/bookmarks/FILENAME.json`.
If the given file already exists, it is overwritten.
****

Another example:

* `*export* CS2103TStuff` +
Exports all bookmark manager data to a file named `mark/data/bookmarks/CS2103TStuff.json`
(assuming `mark.jar` is located in the folder `mark`). The content of `CS2103TStuff.json`
is identical to the current content of `mark.json`.
// end::exportcommand[]

==== Importing bookmarks: *`import`*

If you need a way to re-add bookmarks to Mark after deleting them and closing the application,
the `*import*` command will help you along. This command imports bookmarks from JSON files
like those produced by `*export*`.

A bookmark is, by default, imported into a folder with the same name as its original folder (even if the folder
structure is different). If no such folder is found, the bookmark will be imported
into the folder `ImportedBookmarks`.

NOTE: Bookmarks with the same name or URL as existing bookmarks are not imported.

Format: `*import* FILENAME`

For example:

* Let's say you originally have many CS2103T bookmarks that you exported to a file named `CS2103TStuff`.
+
// show the bookmarks, or maybe "succesfully exported"
image::ui-screenshots/ImportCommandUi0.png[]

* If you accidentally delete all of the bookmarks _and_ exit from Mark before realising that you
still need them for finals, you can input `*import* CS2103TStuff` to add them back.
+
// show a limited set of Mark sample data - i.e. 2103 things are gone
image::ui-screenshots/ImportCommandUi1.png[]

* You can then rest assured that all of your bookmarks are back in their respective folders, ready for
your use.
+
// show that 2103 things have been put back
image::ui-screenshots/ImportCommandUi2.png[]

Parameter constraints:
****
* `FILENAME` is case sensitive and should not include the file extension. E.g.
`myBookmarks` and not `myBookmarks.json`
* `FILENAME` should consist of only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and/or underscores.
* `FILENAME.json` should be a file stored in the folder
`[applicationHome]/data/bookmarks/`.
* The file corresponding to `FILENAME` should have a valid format, identical
to the JSON files produced by `*export*`.
****


==== Clearing all data: *`clear`*

You can start your life anew with Mark! With this command, all bookmarks, folders, autotags, and reminders will be cleared.

Format: `*clear*`

// How to use the command (what should you see) i.e. before/after
For example:

* You decide that Mark is too cluttered, and so out of frustration you type `clear` into the command box and smash kbd:[Enter].
+
image::ui-screenshots/ClearCommandUi1.png[]
* Mark is now empty!
+
image::ui-screenshots/ClearCommandUi2.png[]

.Folder hierarchy as seen in the dashboard tab
image::ui-screenshots/FolderHierarchy.png[]

IMPORTANT: The bookmarks that are displayed in the folder hierarchy correspond to the bookmarks in the bookmarks list on the left. +
 +
For example, if you have have just performed a `find` command and the bookmark list shrinks from 100 entries to just 10, the folder hierarchy will also
shrink from showing 100 bookmarks to 10.

'''

// tag::autotags[]
=== Autotags

_Autotags_ are tags that will be automatically applied to bookmarks that match their
autotag conditions.
You can view the details of existing autotags in the autotag panel at the bottom-right of
the **Dashboard** tab, as seen below.

.The autotag panel on the Dashboard tab
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagPanel.png[]

// tag::autotagcommand[]
[[Autotag-Command]]
==== Creating an automatic tag: *`autotag`*

If you want to tag a group of similar bookmarks without manually editing each one, you
can use the `autotag` command to create an autotag to do it for you.
You will need to define _conditions_ that describe the key characteristics of the bookmarks to be tagged.

NOTE: Conditions fall into two categories: _normal conditions_, which are characteristics that
bookmarks to be tagged **should** match, and _not-conditions_, which are conditions that bookmarks
should *not* match.

You can specify conditions relating to the name, URL, and/or folder (also known as _attributes_)
of a bookmark. It is also possible not to specify any condition for an attribute if the attribute
is not relevant. However, an autotag must have at least one condition specified; otherwise, it
would automatically tag all your bookmarks!

====
Format: `*autotag* TAG_NAME [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [u/URL_KEYWORD]... [f/FOLDER]...
[nn/NOT_NAME_KEYWORD]... [nu/NOT_URL_KEYWORD]... [nf/NOT_FOLDER]...`
====

For example:

* To add a new autotag, input `*autotag* NUS n/NUS n/School n/Uni` into the command box.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandUi1.png[]

* You can then check that an autotag named `NUS` with three name conditions (`NUS`, `School`, and `Uni`)
has been added to the autotag panel of the Dashboard. Also, notice that bookmarks with names
that contain `NUS`, `School` or `Uni` now have the tag `NUS`.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandUi2.png[]

[[autotag-parameter-constraints]]
There are several restrictions on the usage of command parameters:
****
* At least one condition (`n/`, `nn/`, `u/`, `nu/`, `f/`, or `nf/`) must be specified.
* `TAG_NAME` should be a valid tag name that is not the name of an existing autotag.
However, `TAG_NAME` can still be used as a normal tag. E.g. if an autotag `YouTube` matches
bookmarks with URLs containing `youtube.com`, other bookmarks can still be
tagged with the tag `YouTube`.
* `NAME_KEYWORD` and `URL_KEYWORD` are used to match bookmarks in a similar way
as the keywords in <<finding-bookmarks, `*find*`>>. The only difference is that a single
keyword parameter can contain multiple words. E.g. `n/Module W` will match names
`CS2103T Module Website` and `module work to do` but not `Future modules`.
* `FOLDER` should be the exact name of a folder (case insensitive). E.g. `wiki` will match
`Wiki` but not `Wikipedia`.
* `NOT_NAME_KEYWORD`, `NOT_URL_KEYWORD`, and `NOT_FOLDER` are name keywords,
URL keywords, or folder names that bookmarks to be tagged should *not* match.
****

IMPORTANT: If an autotag's conditions contradict each other, no bookmarks will be tagged.
E.g. an autotag with conditions `u/github.com/mark nu/github.com/` will do nothing as no
bookmark can have a URL containing `github.com/mark` and not `github.com`.

[NOTE]
====
If multiple conditions are specified, bookmarks that meet the following requirements will be matched:

    * Matches at least one condition within the same attribute type
    for normal conditions (`n/`, `u/`, and `f/`) (i.e. OR search). E.g. `n/wiki n/comput` will match
    names `WikiHow` and `Computer Science`.
    * Matches all conditions within the same condition type
    for not-conditions (`nn/`, `nu/`, and `nf/`) (i.e. AND search). E.g. `nf/Work nf/School` will
    match bookmarks that are not in the folder `Work` and not in the folder `School`.
    * Matches all conditions across different condition types are matched. E.g. `n/web
    n/mod f/NUS` will match bookmarks with [names that match `web` and/or `mod`] AND [are in the
    folder `NUS`].
====

Other examples:

* `*autotag* LumiNUS u/luminus.nus.edu.sg nf/Miscellaneous`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandExample1.png[]
+
Creates an autotag named `LumiNUS` which tags all bookmarks with URLs
containing `luminus.nus.edu.sg` that are not in the folder `Miscellaneous`.

* `*autotag* Quiz f/NUS f/Module nu/github nu/stackoverflow`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandExample2.png[]
+
Creates an autotag named `Quiz` which tags all bookmarks that are either in
the folder `NUS` or in the folder `Module`, and that do not contain the
keywords `github` or `stackoverflow` in their URLs.
// end::autotagcommand[]

==== Editing an automatic tag: *`autotag-edit`*

If you want to modify an autotag, you can use the *`autotag-edit`* command to edit the autotag's
name and/or conditions.

TIP: This is essentially a shortcut for *`autotag-delete`* followed by *`autotag-add`*.

Format: `*autotag-edit* TAG_NAME [t/NEW_TAG_NAME] [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [u/URL_KEYWORD]... [f/FOLDER]...
[nn/NOT_NAME_KEYWORD]... [nu/NOT_URL_KEYWORD]... [nf/NOT_FOLDER]...`

For example:

* To modify an autotag named `NUS`, type `*autotag-edit* NUS t/University f/School f/General f/Modules f/CS2103T`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagEditCommandUi1.png[]

* You can then observe that the autotag `NUS` has been renamed `University`, and its folder conditions now
include the folder `CS2103T`.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagEditCommandUi2.png[]

The parameter constraints are similar to <<autotag-parameter-constraints, the `*autotag*` command's>>,
with the following differences:
****
* There should only be one `NEW_TAG_NAME`.
* At least one parameter _in total_ should be specified. In other words, if `t/NEW_TAG_NAME` is present, there is
no need to specify any conditions.
****

Other examples:

* `*autotag-edit* Quiz u/luminus.nus.edu.sg u/quiz nu/attempt`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagEditCommandExample1.png[]
+
Modifies the autotag `Quiz` such that it tags bookmarks with URLs that contain either of the keywords
`luminus.nus.edu.sg` or `quiz`, but do not contain the keyword `attempt`.

* `*autotag-edit* Quiz t/Quizzes`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagEditCommandExample2.png[]
+
Modifies the name of the autotag `Quiz` such that it now tags bookmarks with the tag `Quizzes` instead of `Quiz`.

==== Deleting an automatic tag: *`autotag-delete`*

If you no longer need an autotag, you can delete it from Mark using the `autotag-delete`
command. None of your existing tags will be affected.

Format: `*autotag-delete* TAG_NAME`

For example:

* To delete the autotag `NUS`, input `*autotag-delete* NUS` into the command box.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagDeleteCommandUi1.png[]

* You can then check that the autotag named `NUS` has been deleted from the autotag panel of the Dashboard.
In addition, no bookmarks have been modified.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagDeleteCommandUi2.png[]

Parameter constraints:
****
* `TAG_NAME` should be the name of an existing autotag.
****
// end::autotags[]

Another example:

* `*autotag-delete* Quiz` +
 Deletes the autotag that would have tagged bookmarks that match its conditions
with the tag `Quiz`. New and edited bookmarks will no longer be automatically tagged `Quiz`.

'''

=== Offline Copies

The following commands carry out operations relating to <<offline-copy, offline copies>>
of bookmarked web pages.

==== Saving an offline copy: *`cache`*

Saves the bookmarked website locally for offline viewing.

Format: `*cache* INDEX`

Parameter constraints:
****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to save an offline copy of. If there is a previous version, it will be overwritten.
****

Examples:

* `*cache* 1` +
Saves an offline copy of the first bookmark.

==== Deleting an offline copy: *`cache-delete`*

Deletes an offline copy of a bookmark.

Format: `*cache-delete* INDEX`

Parameter constraints:
****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to delete the offline copy of. It must have an offline copy to delete.
****

Examples:

* `*cache-delete* 2` +
Deletes the offline copy of the second bookmark.

==== Viewing an offline copy: *`offline`*

If you want to view the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `offline` command. Your view will be switched
to the offline tab where the offline copy is shown.

Format: `*offline* INDEX`
//TODO: [v/VERSION = current]`

Parameter constraints:
****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to view notes of
//TODO: * `VERSION` is the version of the cached version to show. Default is the current version
****

Examples:

* `*offline* 1` +
Shows annotated offline copy of bookmark 1.


// tag::annCmd[]
[[annotate]]
==== Making annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate`*

If you want to add a new annotation on the offline copy of a bookmark,
you can do so using the `annotate` command.
With this command, you can highlight a paragraph on the offline document and
optionally attach a supplementary note to said paragraph. You can add notes
to explain the highlight or as content-relevant notes to refer to in future.

If you are looking to add a general note not pertaining to any specific paragraph, you
can also use this command to add it to the bottom of the page, hereby known as the _General notes section_.

Upon annotating, the your view will be switched to the offline tab
showing the results of your command.

NOTE: A general note is not attached to any paragraph of the original web page. Instead, when adding general notes, they are attached
to invisible at the bottom of the document.
General notes are found at the bottom of the page, referred to as the _General notes section_.

You can choose to use this command to overwrite any existing note. However, note that when you highlight
the paragraph of a general note, Mark remembers the hidden highlight colour, but no highlight is reflected on the application.

NOTE: Paragraphs are identified using a numbered identifier that starts with either `P` or `G`. You can refer to the
numbered identifier in the leftmost column of the offline document to check out the respective identifier for each paragraph.
Paragraphs of general notes have identifiers that begin with `G`, while paragraphs from the original web page have identifiers that begin with `P`.

Format: `*annotate* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR=yellow]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate* 24 p/p1 n/summary of paragraph h/orange` into the command box.

image::ui-screenshots/AddAnnotationCommandUi1.png[100,400]
// offline tab, showing result after   annotate 1 p/p2

* Observe that paragraph P1 is now highlighted orange and a note with content “summary of paragraph” is attached to it.

image::ui-screenshots/AddAnnotationCommandUi2.png[300, 400]
// offline tab, showing result.


Parameter constraints:
****
 * `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to be marked.
 `PARA_NUM` must be `NULL` or it must begin with `P` or `G` (e.g. `P3`). `PARA_NUM` is case-insensitive.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `NOTES` is the content of notes to add.
 * `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. If no colour is specified,
the colour is set to yellow by default.
If the colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Other examples:

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2` +
This highlights paragraph P2 yellow in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2 h/pink` +
This overwrites any existing highlight of paragraph P2 with pink
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Any notes attached remain attached.

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2 n/change or add note content` +
This overwrites any note attached to paragraph P2 to a note with content “change or add note content”
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Highlight
colour remains the same. Otherwise, paragraph P2 will be highlighted yellow and
a new note with content "change or add note content" will be added to the paragraph.

* `*annotate* 1 p/null n/adding a general note` +
This adds a note with content "adding a general note" to the _General notes section_ in the
offline copy of bookmark 1.
// end::annCmd[]

[[annotate-edit]]
==== Modifying annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-edit`*

If you want to modify existing annotations on the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `annotate-edit` command.
You can choose to overwrite the existing note of a particular paragraph with another note, change the highlight or
choose to move notes from a paragraph to another paragraph. You can also use this command to move a general note to the main text by specifying which original paragraph to move it to.

NOTE: While both `*annotate-edit*` and `*annotate*` can be used to change current annotation highlight and notes, `*annotate-edit*`
allows you to shift your annotations from one paragraph to another in a single step.

Moving of notes to the <<stray-notes, _General notes section_>> is not supported. If you really want to shift them,
use <<annotatedelete, `*annotate-delete*`>> with  `n/true` as the only optional flag you include.

Upon editing an annotation, your view will be switched to the offline tab showing the results of your command.

Format: `*annotate-edit* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [to/NEW_PARA_NUM] [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate-edit* 24 p/g1 to/p1 h/green` into the command box.

image::ui-screenshots/EditAnnotationCommandUi1.png[200,400]
// offline tab after   annotate 1 p/null n/this note was once a general note

* Observe that the general note removed from the bottom and attached to pararaph P1. At the same time, paragraph P1 is highlighted green.

image::ui-screenshots/EditAnnotationCommandUi2.png[400,400]

Parameter constraints:
****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph which you want to edit annotation of. `PARA_NUM` is case-insensitive.
If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or the corresponding paragraph does not have existing annotations, a warning message will be displayed.
* `NEW_PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to move the annotation to. `NEW_PARA_NUM` is also case-insensitive.
If `NEW_PARA_NUM` is the same as `PARA_NUM` or is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `NOTES` is the content of notes to change to. Whenever notes is given, it
replaces any pre-existing note to paragraph `PARA_NUM`, if applicable.
* `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. When no colour is specified, the higlihgt of the source paragraph is
used.
If colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Other examples:

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p2 to/p3` +
This moves both the highlight and notes from paragraph P2 to paragraph P3 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.
The highlight of paragraph P2 is removed.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p2 to/p3 h/orange` +
This moves the note from paragraph P2 to paragraph P3 in the offline copy of bookmark 1. The highlight of paragraph P2
is removed and paragraph P3 is highlighted with orange.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p1 n/new notes` +
This replaces the content of the note for paragraph P1 with "new notes" in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p1 h/yellow` +
This changes the highlight colour to yellow for paragraph P1 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/g2 to/p1` +
This moves the general note G2 to paragraph P1 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p2 to/p3 n/changing and moving notes` +
This annotates paragraph P3 with the highlight of paragraph 2 and
a note with content "changing and moving notes". The annotation on paragraph P2 is removed.

[[annotatedelete]]
==== Deleting annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-delete`*

If you want to delete highlights or notes from the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `annotate-delete` command.
You can choose to remove just the notes and/or highlight of a paragraph, or clear all annotations
on the offline copy to revert it to a clean slate. You can also choose to remove a note from the
<<stray-notes,_General notes section_>>.

If the given paragraph does not have any annotations to remove, nothing is performed.
Also, you cannot choose to remove only the highlight from the paragraph of a general note since it does not display a highlight in the first place.

Upon deleting an annotation, your view will be switched to the offline tab showing the results of your command.

Format: `*annotate-delete* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/KEEP_NOTES=false] [h/KEEP_HIGHLIGHT=false]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate-delete* 24 p/p1 n/true` into the command box.

image::ui-screenshots/DeleteAnnotationCommandUi1.png[200,400]
// offline tab, after   annotate 1 p/p2 h/pink n/this note is originally not general

* Observe that the highlight of paragraph P1 if removed and the note is moved to the _General notes section_.

image::ui-screenshots/DeleteAnnotationCommandUi2.png[200,400]

Parameter constraints:
****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to remove annotations of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to remove annotation(s) from. `PARA_NUM` must be either `all` or begin with `P` or `S`.
 If you entered `all` for this parameter, all annotations will be cleared regardless of other options, reverting the offline document to a clean slate.
 If you specified a phantom paragraph instead, the phantom paragraph will be deleted if `n/KEEP_NOTES` parameter is set to `false`.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or there is no annotation to delete, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_NOTES` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the notes of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the notes will be removed. `KEEP_NOTES` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_NOTES` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the highlight of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the highlight will be removed. `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT`` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Other examples:

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2` +
This removes both the note and highlight from paragraph P2 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2 h/true` +
This removes the note of paragraph P2 in the offline copy of bookmark 1, leaving the highlight untouched.

* `*annotate-delete* 2 p/g1` +
This deletes the general note G1 in the offline copy of bookmark 2.
