    "description": "This course offers a window into the complex arrangements of social life in cities. It explores the ways in which social structures and dynamics are folded into and through urban contexts, specifically by imagining the city from four planes of social life. We examine (i) \u2018cities of difference\u2019 (ii) \u2018cities of scales\u2019 (iii) \u2018cities of relations\u2019 (iv) \u2018cities of actions\u2019. At the end of the course, students will gain clearer recognition of the darker structures in urban life, the complicity of society and culture in stabilising them, but also a deeper appreciation for spaces of hope that allow for change.",
