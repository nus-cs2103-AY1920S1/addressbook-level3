    "description": "The primary objective of the module is to develop a fundamental understanding of how to formulate the governing equations of continua with the aid of basic conservation laws of physics that govern the behaviour of a continuum. An allied objective is to apply the governing equations to simplified as well as industrially-relevant problems in solid mechanics and fluid mechanics. Overall, this course provides a foundation for the role of continuum mechanics in engineering and science.",
