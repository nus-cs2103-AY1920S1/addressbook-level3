    "description": "Chemistry is a central science that plays profound roles in our lives, representing biomolecules responsible for life itself (e.g. DNA, proteins), and ranging from the clothes we wear to the pharmaceutical products we rely on to treat diseases. We are living in a fast-developing modern society, and 'sustainable development' is an extremely important global challenge. Green Chemistry is an emerging science focusing on principles that prevent or minimize waste production, thus providing a viable solution to sustainability. Topics to be discussed include: green chemistry and sustainability, principles of green chemistry, green chemistry tools/approaches towards sustainability.",
