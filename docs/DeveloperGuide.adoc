== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ChartBox` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Has a specialized `Chart` component that deals specifically with the generation and rendering of charts onto the `MainWindow`.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `BillboardParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Billboard and ArchiveWrapper data, i.e current expenses and archived past expenses.
* stores `UniqueTagList` and `TagCountManager` to track tags.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Billboard`, which `Expense` can reference. This would allow `Billboard` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Expense` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Billboard data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.billboardbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBillboard`.

If you successfully execute a command that will change the Billboard state,
the current Billboard state will automatically commit to the `VersionedBillboard`.
The current state will be store into the `stateList`,
and a state pointer `currentStatePointer` will be maintained.

 List of command that will commit to VersionedBillboard:
- AddArchiveCommand
- AddCommand
- AddTagCommand
- ClearCommand
- DeleteArchiveCommand
- DeleteCommand
- RevertArchiveCommand
- EditCommand
- RemoveTagCommand

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBillboard#commit()` -- Saves the current billboard state in its history.
* `VersionedBillboard#undo()` -- Restores the previous billboard state from its history.
* `VersionedBillboard#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone billboard state from its history.

These operations is exposed in the `VersionedBillboard` class as `VersionedBillboard#commit()`., `VersionedBillboard#undo()` and `VersionedBillboard#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBillboard` will be initialized with the initial billboard state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single billboard state.

.Initial state of VersionedBillboard
image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th expense in the billboard. The `delete` command calls `VersionedBillboard#commit()`, causing the modified state of the billboard after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `stateList`, and the `statePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted billboard state.

.State of VersionedBillboard after "delete 5" command
image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/buy ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commit()`, causing another modified billboard state to be saved into the `stateList`.

.State of VersionedBillboard after "add n/buy..." command
image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `VersionedBillboard#commit()`, so the billboard state will not be saved into the `stateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `VersionedBillboard#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous billboard state, and restores the billboard to that state.

.State of VersionedBillboard after "undo" command
image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is pointing to the initial billboard state,
then there are no previous billboard states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `VersionedBillboard#isRedoable()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `undo` Command
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `VersionedBillboard#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the billboard to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `stateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest billboard state, then there are no undone billboard states to restore. The `redo` command uses `VersionedBillboard#isRedoable()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the billboard, such as `list`, will usually not call `VersionedBillboard#commit()`, `VersionedBillboard#undo()` or `VersionedBillboard#redo()`. Thus, the `stateList` remains unchanged.

.State of VersionedBillboard after "list" command
image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `VersionedBillboard#commit()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `stateList`, all billboard states after the `statePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/buy ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

.State of VersionedBillboard after "clear" command
image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire billboard.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the expense being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of billboard states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `Model` and `VersionedBillboard`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::archive[]
=== Archive
==== Implementation
===== Modelling Archive
The archive feature supports the following actions:

* Creating an archive
* Adding an expense to an archive
* Reverting/"unarchiving" an archived expense
* Deleting an archived expense
* Displaying the list of expense of a particular archive
* Listing all existing archive names


These actions are facilitated by the `ArchiveWrapper` and `Archive` classes:

.Structure and associations of `ArchiveWrapper` and `Archive` classes
image::ArchiveClassDiagram.png[]

*  `*Archive*` extends from `*ExpenseList*` in order to encapsulate an archive name and a list of expenses together as an archive.
* `*ArchiveWrapper*` manages all existing archives and hashes each `*Archive*` object to its archive name.

The implementation of the archive feature is located in the `*Model*` component in terms of the overall architecture of _Billboard_.

`*ArchiveWrapper*` is used in `*ModelManager*` to manage all archives. Its respective operations are called to access and manipulate archive expenses when an archive command is entered. +
Such operations include:

* `*ArchiveWrapper#AddArchive(Archive)*` - Adds the given archive to the current map of archive objects.
* `*ArchiveWrapper#HasArchive(String)*` - Checks if the specified archive by the given archive name exists.
* `*ArchiveWrapper#removeArchive(Archive)*` - Deletes the given archive from the current map of archive objects. (Assumes given archive already exists)
* `*ArchiveWrapper#hasArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*` - Checks if the specified archive by the given archive name has the given expense.
* `*ArchiveWrapper#addArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*` - Adds the given expense into the specified archive by the given archive name. (Assumes given archive already exists)
* `*ArchiveWrapper#removeArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*` - Deletes the given expense into the specified archive by the given archive name. (Assumes given archive and expense already exists)
* `*ArchiveWrapper#getArchiveNames()*` - Returns a set of all existing archive names

These operations are exposed in the `*Model*` interface respectively as:

* `*Model#addArchive(Archive)*`
* `*Model#HasArchive(String)*`
* `*Model#deleteArchive(Archive)*`
* `*Model#hasArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*`
* `*Model#addArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*`
* `*Model#deleteArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*`
* `*Model#getArchiveNames()*`

Given below is an example usage scenario of the add expense to archive function, showing how the command is parsed in `*Logic*` and how it interacts with `*Model*`: +

Step 1. The user has the application running and has a non empty list of current expenses. The user can enter the `list` command to bring up
this list. +

Step 2. The user executes the command `archive add 3 arc/archiveName` to archive an expense. +
The command is first parsed by `*BillboardParser*` to determine what kind of general command it is. `archive` indicates it is an archive command so the remaining input is parsed through `*ArchiveCommandParser*`. +
`*ArchiveCommandParser*` determines which archive command should be called. `add` indicates it is an add command, so the input is parsed for the final time through `*AddArchiveCommandParser*` to extract out the arguments entered for the operation.
In this case, the arguments are `3` and `archiveName` +

This layered parsing process can be visualised below:

.Process of parsing `AddArchiveCommand` in a cropped sequence diagram
image::AddArchiveCommandSequenceDiagram_Parsing.png[]

Step 3. `*AddArchiveCommandParser*` then returns an `*AddArchiveCommand*` object to be executed. The `*AddArchiveCommand*` performs two checks before executing any changes:

* First, it is changed if entered index, `3`, is a valid index from the current expense list. An exception is thrown and the command is aborted if the index is invalid,
so `*Model*` is left unmodified in this case.
* Next, it is checked if the entered archive name, `archiveName`, is an existing archive by calling `*Model#HasArchive(String)*`. If the archive does not already exist,
then a new archive is created with the given archive name using `*Model#addArchive(Archive)*`. +

After the checks are completed and if no exception is thrown, the command executes the archiving of the expense through these steps:

* The expense to be archived is first retrieved by `*Model#getFilteredList()#get(int)*`
* The expense is then deleted from the list of current expenses by calling `*model#deleteExpense(Expense)*`
* Next, the expense's `archiveName` field is updated using `*Expense#archiveTo(String)*`
* Lastly, the expense is added to the specified archive using `*Model#addArchiveExpense(String, Expense)*`

These interactions with `*Model*` by `*AddArchiveCommand*` can be shown in the cropped portion of the full sequence diagram below:

.Interactions between `*Model*` and `*AddArchiveCommand*` during the execution of the command
image::AddArchiveCommandSequenceDiagram_executeCommand.png[]

Step 4. Finally, a `*CommandResult*` object initialised with the add expense to archive success message is returned to indicate to the user that the operation was successful. +

Full Sequence diagram of the operation:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `*AddArchiveCommand*`:

.`*AddArchiveCommand*` activity diagram
image::AddArchiveCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Storing Archive
All expenses, archived and non-archived, are stored in a single JSON file. +

Upon start up of the application, all expenses are retrieved from JSON format and passed into
`*ModelManager*` as a combined `*Billboard*` object. During the initialization of `*ModelManager*`, the expenses in this `*Billboard*` object are filtered out into non-archived and
archived expenses by each `*Expense*` object's `*archiveName*` field. The separate lists of non-archive and archive expenses are then used to initialize new `*Billboard*` and
`*ArchiveWrapper*` objects of `*ModelManager*` respectively. The `*Billboard*` object of `*ModelManager*` is used to maintain non-archive expenses.+

After each command is executed, the expenses in `*Model*` are saved into the JSON file. The method `*Model#getCombinedBillboard*` is called which collates all `*Expense*` objects
from its `*Billboard*` and `*ArchiveWrapper*` objects together into a single list and creates a new combined `*Billboard*` object. This combined `*Billboard*` is returned and used by
`*Storage*` to serialize into JSON format and writes it into the JSON file.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data Structure to hold archives in `ArchiveWrapper`
* ** Alternative 1 (Current implementation): ** Use of HashMap, mapping each archive name to its `*Archive*` object
** Pros: Accessing data in a HashMap is instant. Therefore, retrieving an archive when performing add/delete archive expense operations or checking if an archive exists is fast.
** Cons: As `*ArchiveWrapper*` is initialized with a single list of archive `*Expense*` objects, the initialization process is slower as this given list needs to be iterated
through to filter each `*Expense*` object into their respective `*Archive*` objects in the HashMap.

* ** Alternative 2: ** Use a single list to store all archive expenses
** Pros: Initialization of `*ArchiveWrapper*` is fast, as the given list of archive expenses need not be processed.
** Cons: Some operations, like delete archive expense or get all archive names, are slower as the entire list must be iterated through each time in the worst case scenario.
For example, to check if an expense exists in a particular archive, the entire list must be iterated if the expense to be found is at the end of the list.

===== Aspect: Storing archives
* ** Alternative 1 (Current implementation): ** Storing non-archive and archive expenses together
** Pros: No new storage classes need to be implemented, as this implementation uses the existing classes only.
** Cons: Initialization process of `*ModelManager*` is slower as the expenses need to be filtered into archive and non-archive expenses first.

* ** Alternative 2: ** Storing archive expenses as `*Archive*` objects in a separate file
** Pros: Initialization process of `*ModelManager*` is faster, as its `ArchiveWrapper` object can be initialized directly with the list of `Archive` objects retrieved from the JSON file.
No filtering of archive and non-archive expense from the same list is needed.
** Cons: More difficult to implement, as more JSON storage classes must be added and knowledge on serialising and deserialising new objects is needed.

// end::archive[]

// tag::tagging[]
=== Tagging
==== Proposed Implementation
The tag feature supports the following operations:

* Adding tags to an expense
* Removing tags from an expense
* Filtering expenses by tags
* Listing all existing tags

These actions are facilitated by the `*UniqueTagList*` and `*TagCountManager*` classes:

* `*UniqueTagList*` maps `*String*` to `*Tag*` where `*String*` is the name of the `*Tag*`. It ensures that the same `*Tag*` object is referenced instead of creating many `*Tag*` objects of the same name during operations.
* `*TagCountManager*` maps `*Tag*` to `*Integer*`, where `*Integer*` is the number of `*Expense*` tagged with each `*Tag*`. It allows `*Tag*` objects that are not tagged with any `*Expense*` to be tracked and removed.

Operations include:

* `*UniqueTagList#retrieveTags(List<String>)*` -- Retrieves corresponding tags from `*UniqueTagList*` based on the list of tag names.
* `*UniqueTagList#removeAll(List<Tag>)*` -- Removes tags given in the list from the `*UniqueTagList*`.
* `*UniqueTagList#getTagNames()*` -- Returns a list of existing tag names.
* `*TagCountManager#incrementAllCount(Set<Tag>)*` -- Increments the `*Integer*` mapped to the tags in the set by 1.
* `*TagCountManager#decreaseAllCount(Set<Tag>)*` -- Decreases the `*Integer*` mapped to the tags in the set by 1.
* `*TagCountManager#removeZeroCount()*` -- Removes all mappings where the `*Integer*` is equal to 0.

These operations are exposed in the `*Model*` interface as:

* `*Model#retrieveTags(List<String>)*`
* `*Model#incrementCount(Set<Tag>)*`
* `*Model#decreaseCount(Set<Tag>)*` -- `*TagCountManager#removeZeroCount()*` and `*UniqueTagList#removeAll(List<Tag>)*` are called in this method to remove any tag not tagged to any expense from the `*UniqueTagList*` and `*TagCountManager*`.
* `*Model#getTagNames()*`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how adding tag executes at every step.

* **Step 1:**
The user launches the application. The `*Model*` is initialized with saved data. All tags are loaded into `*UniqueTagList*` and `*TagCountManager*`.

* **Step 2:**
User enters the command `tag add 1 t/test t/test2` to add tags to the `*Expense*` at index 1 in Billboard. +
*2a*. `*BillboardParser*` parses this command, creating a `*TagCommandParser*` after determining that it is a tag command. +
*2b*. The `*TagCommandParser*` then parses `add 1 t/test t/test2` and creates an `*AddTagCommandParser*` after determining that it is a command to add tags. +
*2c*. Subsequently, the `*AddTagCommandParser*` parses `1 t/test1 t/test2` into `*Index*` 1 and
a list of `*String*` consisting of `test1` and `test2`. `*AddTagCommandParser*` creates `*AddTagCommand*` with the `*Index*` and list of `*String*` as parameters.

* **Step 3:**
`*LogicManager*` executes the `*AddTagCommand*`. +
During execution, +
*3a*. `*AddTagCommand*` calls `*Model#retrieveTags(List<String>)*` on the list of `*String*` consisting of `test1` and `test2` which returns a set of `*Tag*` with tag names `test1` and `test2`. +
*3b*. `*AddTagCommand*` then calls `*Model#incrementCount(Set<Tag>)*` on the set of `*Tag*`. +
*3c*. Lastly, `*AddTagCommand*` calls `*Model#setExpense(Expense, Expense)*` which edits and updates the `*Expense*` at index 1 in the `*Model*`. The updated `*Expense*` is then reflected on the GUI.

[NOTE]
Duplicate tags in an `*Expense*` is not allowed. +
If the user tries to add an existing `*Tag*` to an `*Expense*`, `*AddTagCommand*` throws an exception, leading to an error message. +
If the user tries to add duplicate `*Tag*`, i.e enter 2 of the same `*Tag*`, `*AddTagCommand*` adds the tag once and increments the number of expenses tagged to it by 1.

The following sequence diagram shows how the adding tag operation works.

image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[]
Figure 21. Sequence diagram of executing AddTagCommand.

NOTE: The lifeline for `*TagCommandParser*` and `*AddTagCommandParser*` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a command to add tags to an expense.

image::AddTagActivityDiagram.png[]
Figure 22. Activity diagram of executing AddTagCommand.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support tag commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `*UniqueTagList*` to map tag names to `*Tag*` and `*TagCountManager*` to map `*Tag*` to number of `*Expense*` tagged to it.
** Pros:
*** Each structure has only one responsibility.
*** Fast retrieval and update of data
** Cons:
*** Requires maintenance of both structures as they need to sync with each other.
*** Retrieval of all `*Expense*` under a `*Tag*` requires filtering through the whole list of `*Expense*`.

* **Alternative 2 :** Have each `*Tag*` store a list of `*Expense*` tagged to it.
** Pros:
*** Fast retrieval of all `*Expenses*` under each `*Tag*`
** Cons:
*** Circular dependency
*** Since implementation of Billboard objects are immutable, there is a constant need to update the `*Expense*` in the list even after executing non-tag related commands.

* **Alternative 3 :** Use one map to map `*Tag*` to `*Expense*` tagged to it.
** Pros:
*** Fast retrieval of all `*Expenses*` under each `*Tag*`
** Cons:
*** Since implementation of Billboard objects are immutable, there is a constant need to update the `*Expense*` in the list even after executing non-tag related commands.

// end::tagging[]

// find:finding[]
=== [Enhanced] Find
==== Proposed Implementation
The find feature supports the finding expenses by any combination of the following conditions:

* Keywords
* Lower/upper amount limit
* Lower/upper creation date limit

These actions are facilitated by the `MultiArgPredicate` class:

* `MultiArgPredicate` implements the `Predicate` interface. It enables filtering of expenses by multiple attributes
through keeping track of a set of predicates that can be applied when prompted by user input.

Operations include:

* `MultiArgPredicate#setKeywords(List<String>)` -- Set list of keywords to search by.
* `MultiArgPredicate#setDateRange(CreatedDate, CreatedDate)` -- Set start date and end date limit to search by.
* `MultiArgPredicate#setAmtRange(Amount, Amount)` -- Set upperLimit and lowerLimit of amount of expenses to search by.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1.
The user launches the application. The `Model` is initialized with saved data. All expenses are loaded into `FilteredList`.

Step 2.
User enters the command `find d/keywords a/lowerAmtLimit al/upperAmtLimit sd/startDate ed/endDate` to find expenses that matches conditions set by user input. `BillboardParser` parses the command, creating a `FindCommandParser`.
The `FindCommandParser` then parses `find d/keywords a/lowerAmtLimit al/upperAmtLimit sd/startDate ed/endDate` to create a `MultiArgPredicate` inputted with the different filter parameters.
The `MultiArgPredicate` is then used to create the `FindCommand`.

Step 3.
`LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`. During execution, `FindCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenses(Predicate<Expense>)` on the list consisting of `test1` and `test2` which returns a set of `Tag`.
`Model#incrementCount(Set<Tag>)` is then called on the set of `Tag`. The 1st `Expense` is edited and updated in the `Model` using `Model#setExpense(Expense, Expense)` and is then shown on the UI.

[NOTE]
If the user tries to input 2 conditions of the same prefix, only the last condition will be used.

// The following sequence diagram shows how the enhanced find operation works.

// image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.png[]

// The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a command to find expenses by certain conditions.

// image::AddTagActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support enhanced find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `MultiArgPredicate` to filter selected expense from the `FilteredList`.
`MultiArgPredicate` holds and combines a set of predicates of various types into a single predicate.
Set of predicates can but do not need to include `AllContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `AmountWithinRangePredicate` and `DateWithinRangePredicate`.
** Pros:
*** Only one variation of input command required.
*** No need for different kinds of find commands to handle filtering by different attribute.
*** No need for different kinds of find command parsers to handle parsing of different variations of input command.
** Cons:
*** Higher complexity of code in FindCommandParser.
*** User need to use prefix to indicate type of conditions inputted.
*** Additional predicate `MultiArgPredicate` required to handle filtering by more than one condition.

* **Alternative 2 :** `FindCommandParser` maps input command to individual type of predicate that is used to create find command.
** Pros:
*** Commands are simpler and shorter.
** Cons:
*** Limited functionality - can only find by one condition.
*** Use of different types of find commands.

// end::finding[]

// recur:recurring[]
=== Recurring Expenses
==== Proposed Implementation
The recurring expenses feature supports the adding of recurring expenses into Billboard. Recurring expenses have a start date and a end date.
The date of the first expense will be the start date, and subsequent expenses will defer from the previous expenses by a date interval specified by the user.
The recurring expense feature supports the following operations:

* Listing all the recurrences
* Adding a new recurrence which will add recurring expenses to the list of expenses
* Editing an existing recurrence [Coming in V2.0]
* Deleting an existing recurrence [Coming in V2.0]

These actions are facilitated by the `Recurrence` and `RecurrenceList` classes:

image::RecurrenceClassDiagram.png[]

`*RecurrenceList*` is used in `*ModelManager*` to manage all recurrences. Its respective operations are called to access and manipulate recurrence expenses when an recurrence command is entered. +
Such operations include:

* `*RecurrenceList#add(Recurrence)*` - Adds the given recurrence to the current list of recurrence objects.
* `*RecurrenceList#contains(Recurrence)*` - Checks if the specified recurrence by the given recurrence name exists.
* `*RecurrenceList#remove(Recurrence)*` - Deletes the given recurrence from the current list of recurrence objects. (Assumes given recurrence already exists)
* `*RecurrenceList#setRecurrence(Recurrence, Recurrence)*` - Set existing recurrence to new recurrence
* `*RecurrenceList#setRecurrences(RecurrenceList)*` - Set the list of recurrences to the given recurrence list
* `*RecurrenceList#setRecurrences(List<Recurrence>)*` - Set the list of recurrences to the given recurrence list

These operations are exposed in the `*Model*` interface respectively as:

* `*Model#addRecurrence(Recurrence)*`
* `*Model#hasRecurrence(String)*`
* `*Model#removeRecurrence(Recurrence)*`
* `*Model#removeRecurrence(int)*`
* `*Model#setRecurrences(RecurrenceList)*`
* `*Model#setRecurrences(List<Recurrence>)*`
* `*Model#getRecurrences()*`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the recurrence mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1.
The user launches the application. The `Model` is initialized with saved data. All expenses are loaded into `FilteredList`. No recurrence data is saved for now so model starts with an empty `RecurrenceList`

Step 2.
User enters the command `recur add n/name d/description a/amount sd/startDate ed/endDate interval/interval` to add recurring expenses that matches conditions set by user input. `BillboardParser` parses the command, creating a `RecurringCommandParser`.
The `RecurringCommandParser` then parses `add n/name d/description a/amount sd/startDate ed/endDate interval/interval` to create a `AddRecurrenceCommandParser` to parse all the variables.
The variables are then used to create the `AddRecurrenceCommand`.

The layered parsing process can be visualised below:
{nbsp} +
image:AddRecurrenceCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 3.
`LogicManager` executes the `AddRecurrenceCommand`. During execution, `AddRecurrenceCommand` calls `Model#addRecurrence(Recurrence)` and `Model#addExpense(Expense)`on the new recurrence and expenses created.
`Model#incrementCount(Set<Tag>)` is then called on the set of `Tag`. The expense are then updated and shown on the UI.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `*AddRecurrenceCommand*`:

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics
Billboard includes a dynamically updating statistics panel containing a chart. It has the following functionality: +

** Every time the displayed list of expenses changes, the chart automatically updates with the new changes
** Users can submit commands to change the displayed chart as well as change configuration options for the charts

This functionality is made possible through the statistics module. The statistics module is in charge of generating statistics from the currently displayed expenses and rendering it onto the main window.
There are 2 components that help to do this - the chart component and the statistics generator component.
[[Design-Ui-Chart]]
==== Chart component

[[fig-ChartClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Chart Component
image::ChartClassDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

There is a special `Chart` component that deals with the generation and rendering of specific charts based on user input and the expenses being displayed.
The `ChartBox` is the main orchestrating class. It is updated with the latest `StatisticsFormat` and `StatisticsFormatOptions` that the user selects, via the `MainWindow`.
These are classes that represent user configuration on what to be displayed. Upon being updated, it creates the appropriate
`ExpenseChart` with the selected options, to display the selected statistic based on the currently displayed expenses. To transform the data from
the displayed list of expenses to the statistic format required, the `StatisticsGenerator` component is used. The concrete `ExpenseChart` obtains the formatted statistics from the
`StatisticsGenerator` component.

==== Statistics Generation Component
.Structure of the Statistics Generation Component
image::StatisticsGeneratorClassDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

The concrete `ExpenseChart` obtains the data to be displayed from the `StatisticsGenerator` component. A number of classes,
such as `BreakdownGenerator` and `TimelineGenerator` extend `StatisticsGenerator`, and each is in charge of creating a specific
statistic type, ie. `ExpenseBreakdown` and `ExpenseTimeline`. These concrete statistic types encapsulate all the information relevant
to the statistic, which the concrete `ExpenseChart` then uses to render the statistic display.

==== Proposed Implementation
The chart feature can be roughly split two separate parts:

** The dynamic rendering of the chart whenever the displayed expenses are updated
** The functionality to switch between different statistic types and configure customization options

[NOTE]
The Observer pattern plays an integral role in the implementation of major part of the system. To summarize, it is a design pattern that achieves decoupling
by having observers "subscribe" to changes in an observed object, and being notified upon any changes through callbacks. This is opposed to the observed class directly updating
its observers. In the following, the term "notify observers" will be used to denote the act of an observed class being updated and updating all
its observers, and the term "on update" will be used to denote the act of an observer receiving updates from its observed class.

Below is a high level overview of the behaviour of the system when any command is called.

image::DisplayStatisticsActivityDiagram.png[]

As you can see the logic follows the two paths outlined above. One path where the displayed expenses are updated, and one path where `DisplayStatsCommand` is executed, updating the chart.
Both paths can lead to the chart updating, followed by the end of the command. Each path will be explored in slightly further detail below.

===== Update to displayed expenses
. The current `ExpenseChart` observes the list of expenses that are contained in the `MainWindow`.
. When a command which updates the expenses is executed, that command updates the list of expenses in the model.
. That update propagates to the list of expenses in `MainWindow`, which notifies the current chart of its changes.
. Using a `StatisticsGenerator`, the `ExpenseChart` then generates the statistics to be displayed from the new expenses.
. In this manner, changes to the list of expenses are propagated to the display.

An example of how this works can be seen in the sequence diagram below, in the example where the user changes the displayed expenses by using the `ListCommand`.

image::UpdateExpensesSequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +

===== DisplayStatsCommand is called
. The orchestrating `ChartBox` observes `StatisticsFormat` and `StatisticsFormatOptions` in the model.
. When `DisplayStatsCommand` is called, it updates those two objects in the model sequentially.
. First, `ChartBox` is notified about `StatisticsFormat`, and if there is a new one, it creates the appropriate chart and renders it.
. Next, if there are changes to `StatisticsFormatOptions`, the `ChartBox` propagates the relevant changes to the current displayed chart, to update its display.
. In this manner, the current chart can be updated with the new `StatisticsFormat` and `StatisticsFormatOptions`.

An example of how this works can be seen in the sequence diagram below, where `DisplayStatsCommand` is called with a new `StatisticsFormat`.
`StatisticsFormatOptions` is omitted for simplicity.

image::DisplayStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]
{nbsp} +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Approach to generating of statistics
* ** Alternative one (current choice):** Each time there is a change in the backing list of expenses, the statistics are re-generated
by the specific `StatisticsGenerator` for the appropriate statistics format.
** Pros:
*** Simplest implementation, each statistic generator can simply provide a pure function with no side effects that maps from
a list of expenses to the desired format of statistics.
*** Runtime is acceptable as most operations can run in O(n) time at worst, with a reasonable input size of expenses.
*** Statelessness means it is thread safe.
** Cons:
*** Even in cases where the backing list of expenses only change by one element (eg. when a single expense is deleted), the entire
set of statistics will still be re-generated from the list, thus potentially incurring an expensive operation each time
the list is changed.

* ** Alternative two:** Each `StatisticsGenerator` can be structured as a data structure that keeps track of the current statistics data.
Upon a change in the backing list, only the specific change will be propagated, ie. addition of one new expense will internally call
`StatisticsGenerator#AddExpense` which modifies the statistics data appropriately.
** Pros:
*** For simple list changes like adding/removing a single expense, this approach is much faster as it does not have to regenerate
the statistics from the entire list, the statistics only needs to be updated with the specific change.
** Cons:
*** Complicated, need to include methods to handle cases where expenses are added, removed and updated, for every statistic type. If the entire
list is changed frequently, there is no performance benefit.
*** Worse in terms of testability. The `StatisticsGenerator` will depend on an internal state which can be complicated for certain statistics.
*** Not thread safe, in the case of future upgrades to a multi-threaded application, will require adjustments.

* **Alternative three:** The data for certain aggregate statistics formats can be serialized. These formats include things like lifetime average spending
per day/week/month, total number of expenses etc. Upon addition/removal/update of expenses, an in-mem copy of the serialized data can be updated
and saved.
** Pros:
*** The data for certain statistics formats will always be quickly available by simply querying the storage.
*** The data can be stored in a human readable format, so users can view those statistics without opening the application.
** Cons:
*** Requires extra complexity to serialize the data upon each change to the overall list of expenses.

#end::statistics[]

// tag::history[]
=== History feature
==== Implementation

You can use the `history` command to view previous actions.

Billboard will store all the command entered even the command fails to execute or in wrong format.

This function is facilitated by the `CommandHistory` class.

All the histories will be store in a static list `cmdList` in `CommandHistory`.

Also, a state pointer that initially point to the start of cmdList will be maintain
for Up(`&uarr;`)/Down(`&darr;`) key feature(See <<Up-Down-Feature>>)

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CommandHistory#addCmdHistory(String)` -- Store the command into cmdList.
* `CommandHistory#peekNextCmd()` -- Get the next command in command history.
* `CommandHistory#peekPreviousCmd()` -- Get the previous command in command history.
* `CommandHistory#hasCommand()` -- Check whether any command is executed.

.Sequence diagram of CommandHistory class
image::CommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the storing operation works:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

The LogicManager will store the command to CommandHistory before parsing it to ensure all commands are saved.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How command histories are stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all commands including commands that fail to execute.
** Pros: User can see what goes wrong in the previous command.
This is the standard way to implement the history function.
** Cons: Cost more memory to store all commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Store commands that is successfully executed and can be undone/redone.
** Pros: User will not need to view the command that is not useful.
** Cons: User cannot view the invalid command.
// end::history[]

// tag::updownkey[]
[[Up-Down-Feature]]
=== Up/Down key feature
==== Implementation

You can navigate through the command history by pressing Up(`&uarr;`)/Down(`&darr;`) key in `TextFiled`.

This feature makes use of the command history and state pointer stored while executing the previous command.

When initializing the fxml object `TextFiled` in `CommandBox` class,
an action listener will be set to monitor the keyboard activity.
Whenever a Up(`&uarr;`)/Down(`&darr;`) key is pressed, it will retrieve the previous/next command from the `CommandHistory`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Up(`&uarr;`)/Down(`&darr;`) mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The CommandHistory will be initialized with no command state,
and the statePointer is not pointing to any command state.

.Initial state of CommandHistory
image::UpDownKeyState0.png[]

Step 2. The user then execute the delete 5 command to delete the 5th expense in the billboard.
The LogicManager calls CommandHistory#addCmdHistory() and a new command is append to the end of cmdList.

.State of CommandHistory after "delete 5" command
image::UpDownKeyState1.png[]

Step 3. The user now decides to execute the next command in the command history and press the Up(`&uarr;`)key.
The actionListener of the TextField will call CommandHistory#peekNextCmd(),
which will shift the statePointer once to the right,
pointing it to the next command, and return it.

.State of CommandHistory after Up(`&uarr;`)key
image::UpDownKeyState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `statePointer` is at the end of cmdList, pointing to the final command state,
then there are no next command states to get,
it will return the last command to the user rather than attempting to get the next command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Up(`&uarr;`)key works:

.Interactions between components of CommandBox and CommandHistory for the Up(`&uarr;`)key
image::UpKeySequenceDiagram.png[]

The Down(`&darr;`) key does the opposite — it calls CommandHistory#peekPreviousCmd(),
which shifts the statePointer once to the left,
pointing to the previous command state, and return the command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How command histories are stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Navigate through all commands including invalid commands.
** Pros: User can edit the invalid command easily, without typing the whole command again.
** Cons: The static object will need to stay in the memory.
* **Alternative 2:** Only navigate through commands that can be undone/redone.
** Pros: User require less time to navigate through the history to find the command(commands that can be undone/redone are usually long)
** Cons: User will not be able to edited the previous invalid command, cost more time to type the whole command again.
// end::updownkey[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
