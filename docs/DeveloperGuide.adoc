== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The architecture diagram below gives an overall view of NUStudy's structure. Each component
will be explained in more detail in the coming sections.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for initializing and shutting down the application, linking and cleaning up where necessary.

The `commons` package contains classes used by multiple other components, of which `LogsCenter` is important
as it is used for logging. The rest of NUStudy consists of four primary components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of NUStudy.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds application data in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads and writes data to disk.

Each of the four components defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component
and exposes the API using a `{Component Name}Manager` class. For example, the `Logic` component
(see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Inter-component interaction

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `deletenote 1`.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== `UI`

.Class diagram of the `UI` component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

.Detailed class diagram for `Panels` package
image::PanelPackageClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`NoteListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract
`UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

This component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== `Logic`

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Class diagram of the `Logic` component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AppDataParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker × but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== `Model`

.Class diagram of the `Model` component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component is independent of the other three primary components of NUStudy.
It stores application data – notes, questions and revision tasks – as well as a `UserPrefs` object
representing the user's preferences. It also exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Note>` that is bound to the UI,
so any data changes are immediately user-visible.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== `Storage`

.Class diagram of the `Storage` component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

_API:_ link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component reads and writes `UserPrefs` objects and NUStudy data in JSON format.

== Implementation

This section describes some finer details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::lecimage[]
=== Image support for lecture notes

Usually, we do not learn best from just text; we rely on images that our minds can process more easily.
As such, implementing images in lecture notes was considered very important. Although some lecture notes
have multiple images, it is always possible to combine them using basic image editing software like the
GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and Paint, so the implementation was limited to at most image per note.

==== Implementation

Instead of a custom class to represent an image, JavaFX's `scene.image.Image` is used instead.
This is out of necessity, since an `ImageView` is needed to display an image in the GUI and it requires
an `Image` object, not just a `String` path to the image. No significant coupling is introduced
by this choice because `Image` objects can exist without a GUI to display them.

The dialog brought up to let the user choose a file returns `null` if the dialog is closed
_without_ choosing a file (i.e. clicking the close button). Treating `null` as "no image" would surprise the user who
decides to edit a lecture note's image but then decides not to – the image would simply disappear without
warning. Therefore the value `i/none` has to be explicitly provided to remove the image, and `EditNoteDescriptor`
has an additional field `isImageRemoved` to track this. If the image comes out as `null` but `i/none` was
not provided, the image is unchanged.

The static method `selectImage()` in `AppUtil` opens up a dialog allowing the user to choose the necessary image.
This is possible because `FileChooser#showOpenDialog()`, which shows the dialog, can be fed an argument of `null`
instead of having to rely on a `Window` object, which is the domain of the `UI` module.

.Sequence diagram for the execution of `EditNoteCommandParser`
image::ImageSelectionSequenceDiagram.png[]

The diagram above shows how `EditNoteCommandParser` creates an `EditNoteCommand`. It first
creates an `EditNoteDescriptor` to hold details of what changes in the note, setting the new
title (provided by the `t/` argument) and content (`c/`) as necessary. If `i/none` is present,
the `EditNoteDescriptor` is set to remove the image and no dialog is shown. If `i/` is
otherwise provided, `EditNoteCommandParser` calls the static method `AppUtil#selectImage()`,
opening up the image selection dialog; the returned `Image` object is then set in the `EditNoteDescriptor`.
An `EditNoteCommand` containing the `EditNoteDescriptor` is finally returned for execution.

Images are only referenced, not embedded, in the JSON file holding application data. These references are
Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of system files, e.g. `file:data/picture.png`. Since NUStudy is meant to be portable,
we cannot use absolute paths, since they would break when the images are moved or deleted. Instead we copy images
into its data folder, side-by-side with the JSON file, upon execution of any `addnote` or `editnote` command with
an image. The references are then changed to point to these local copies, becoming relative URIs.
// end::lecimage[]

// tag::lecimagedesignconsiderations[]
==== Design considerations: where to place the image?

* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ Images are shown within each lecture note in the first column, and each lecture note
shows all of its title, content and image
** Pros: Easier to implement (FXML does not have to reach into other places)
** Cons: Scrolling through lecture notes, all with images, takes time, but this downside is alleviated
by the `findnote` command
* _Alternative 2:_ Place the images in the second column, below their corresponding title and content
** Pros: More visually appealing, since by keeping just one note in the second column it becomes a kind of flash card
** Cons: Harder to implement (FXML must reach into the object representing the second column),
need to have a separate `NotePreview` JavaFX object since images are only going to be displayed
in the second column

==== Design considerations: when to copy images into the local folder
* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ Images are copied when the command is executed, i.e. `Command#execute()`
** Pros: Effects a better separation of concerns (image selection is not execution of the command, image
copying may be thought of as a side effect of command execution)
** Cons: Need to adapt the file copying code to each command
* _Alternative 2:_ Images are copied when the image is selected, i.e. `AppUtil#selectImage()`
** Pros: Compared to alternative 1, has less time between initial image selection and the copy into
application data. There is a potential application risk if
** Cons: `selectImage()` has two only loosely related responsibilities (worse separation of concerns),
impossible to take into account user preferences for where the application data is stored
// end::lecimagedesignconsiderations[]

// tag::questiond[]
=== Question management feature
==== Current implementation

The question management feature is facilitated by `Model`.
The question-related commands extend `Command` with the question object if necessary.
The commands update the `Model` which is implemented by `ModelManager`.
This in turn updates `AppData` which stores all the questions internally as `UniqueQuestionList`.
Local data will be updated in the end by `LogicManager`.
The commands include:

* `AddQuestionCommand` -- Adds a new question to the app.
* `DeleteQuestionCommand` -- Deletes an existing question in the app.
* `ListQuestionCommand` -- Views the list of all questions available.
* `EditQuestionCommand` -- Edits an existing question in the app. (to be implemented)
* `FindQuestionCommand` -- Finds a question with a specified keyword. (to be implemented)

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addQuestion(Question question)`,
`Model#deleteQuestion(Question question)`, `Model#getFilteredQuestionList()` and
`Model#setQuestion(Question target, Question editedQuestion)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the question mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The app will load all existing information from storage.

Step 2. The user executes `addq q/QUESTION a/ANSWER s/SUBJECT d/DIFFICULTY` command to add a new question to the app.
The `addq` command calls `Model#addQuestion(Question question)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the new question.

Step 3. The user executes `deleteq 5` command to delete the 5th question in the app. The `deleteq` command calls `Model#deleteQuestion(Question target)`
and `Model#updateFilteredQuestionList(Predicate<Question> predicate)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the
target question removed.

Step 4. The user executes `editq 2 a/NEW_ANSWER` command to edit the answer of the 2nd question in the app.
The `editq` command calls `Model#setQuestion(Question target, Question editedQuestion)` and
`Model#updateFilteredQuestionList(Predicate<Question> predicate)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the original
question being replaced by the edited question.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addq` operation works:

image::AddQuestionSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::AddQuestionActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design considerations: How `addq`/`deleteq`/`editq` commands execute
* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ Update the internal storage `UniqueQuestionList` in `AppData` first, then save the updated appData
in local storage when the command finishes executing.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Need the extra step to ensure that the internal list is correctly maintained.
* _Alternative 2:_ Update the local storage directly when the command is executing.
** Pros: No need to implement the internal list.
** Cons: Will access local memory more frequently. May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Design considerations: Data structure to support the question commands
* _Alternative 1 (current choice):_ Use a `UniqueQuestionList` to store questions in `AppData`.
** Pros: Cater to the question model specifically. Question list operations are encapsulated in one class.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated as other models also implement similar list structure.
* _Alternative 2:_ Use Java list to store the questions.
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate list class.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as the model needs to maintain various
list operations.
// end::questiond[]

=== Quiz mode for revision
==== Implementation

The quiz mode feature is facilitated by `Model`.
The quiz-related commands extend `Command` with specific question object.
The commands update the `Model` which is implemented by `ModelManager`.
This in turn updates `AppData` which stores filtered specific questions internally as `QuizQuestionList`.
Local data will be updated in the end by `LogicManager`.
The commands include:

* `QuizModeCommand` -- Enters the quiz mode with questions selected by user.
* `QuizCheckAnswer` -- Checks the correctness of answer entered by user.
* `QuizShowAnswerCommand` -- Shows the answer for current question.
* `QuitQuizModeCommand` -- Quits the quiz mode.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getQuizQuestions(int numOfQuestions, Subject subject
Difficulty difficulty)`, `Model#setQuizQuestionList(ObservableList<Question> quizQuestionList)`,
`Model#showQuizAnswer(int index)`, `Model#getFilteredQuizQuestionList()`, `Model#getFilteredQuizResultList()`,
`Model#checkQuizAnswer(int index, Answer answer)`, `Model#addQuizResult(QuizResult quizResult)`,
`Model#getFilteredQuizResultList()` and `Model#clearQuizQuestionList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the question mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The app will load all existing information from storage.

Step 2. The user executes `quiz n/NUMBER OF QUESTIONS d/DIFFICULTY s/SUBJECT` command to enter quiz mode of the app.
The `quiz` command calls `Model#getQuizQuestions(int numOfQuestions, Subject subject Difficulty difficulty)` and
`Model#setQuizQuestionList(ObservableList<Question> quizQuestionList)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with
a list of specific question selected by user for quiz.

Step 3. The user executes `INDEX:ANSWER` to answer the question. It calls `Model#checkQuizAnswer(int index,
Answer answer)` and `Model#addQuizResult(QuizResult quizResult)`, causing the `AppData` to be updated with the result
of the answer.

Step 4. The user executes `show 2` command to show the answer of 2nd quiz question in the app. The `show` command calls
`Model#showQuizAnswer(int index)`, causing the `AppData` to display the answer on the Ui.

Step 5. The user executes `quit` command to exit from the quiz mode. The `quit` command calls
`Model#clearQuizQuestionList()`, causing the `AppData` to clear all quiz question list and return to normal mode.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `quiz` operation works:

image::QuizModeSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command for quiz:

image::QuizModeActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store the quiz results
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update the internal storage `QuizResultList` in `AppData` first, then save the
updated appData in local storage when the command finishes executing.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Need the extra step to ensure that the internal list is correctly maintained.
* **Alternative 2:** Update the local storage directly when the command is executing.
** Pros: No need to implement the internal list.
** Cons: Will access local memory more frequently. May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the quiz commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `QuizQuestionList` and `QuizResultList` to store data in `AppData`.
** Pros: Cater to the quiz model specifically. Quiz question and result list operations are encapsulated in one class.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated as other models also implement similar list structure.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Java list to store the quiz questions and results.
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate list class.
** Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as the model needs to maintain various
list operations.

=== Statistics feature
==== Implementation

The statistics feature gathers data stored from quizzes done in NUStudy to analyse and return an output.
The different commands supported by the statistics feature are used to filter the type of statistics the user wants.
These commands include:

* `GetQnsCommand` -- Gets all questions answered correctly/incorrectly.
* `GetReportCommand` -- Returns a report of the specified question.
* `GetStatisticsCommand` -- Returns a general overview of how well the user has answered quiz questions.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.
The app will attempt to read past data from any quizzes done and store it internally to a `quizResults` list.

Step 2. The user executes `stats s/CS2103T` command to get the statistics of all quiz questions done for CS2103T.
The `stats` command creates a new `commandResult` setting the type of command to `CHART`.

The following class diagram shows how the `GetStatisticsCommand` and `CommandResult` class are related.

image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]

Step 3. The `commandResult` will call the relevant methods to filter the `quizResults` list and create the relevant outputs.
It will then show a statistics panel, hiding all notes and tasks.

The following sequence diagram shows how the statistics operation works:

image::StatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 4. The user now decides to stop viewing statistics and decides to view all notes and tasks again using the `listnote` command.
The statistics panel will now be hidden.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the statistics command:

image::StatisticsActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How statistics are shown
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Hide all other panels and only show statistics.
** Pros: Less scrolling needed, more information can be shown in one panel.
** Cons: More methods are needed to deal with hiding and showing the different panels leading to more room for errors.
* **Alternative 2:** Place statistics in the main window with notes and tasks.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: The number of notes and tasks that can be seen without scrolling will be decreased.
The charts will be small and condensed making it difficult to see the data at first glance.

=== Add revision task
==== Implementation
`AddTaskForNoteCommand` is implemented to add a task for lecture notes revision with the command `radd`. It extends `Command` class and adds a
`Task` for lecture notes revision to the `TaskList` kept in `AppData` model, which wraps all application data.

The `TaskList` is essentially a list of `Task`. `TaskList` supports the `add(Task)` operation and this operation is
exposed to `AppData#addTask(Task)`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `radd` command is executed:

image::AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Design of `Task`
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** implement `Task` as abstract class with two subclasses to support task for
notes and questions respectively.
** Pros: It allows polymorphism to support different behaviours of task for `Note` and task for `Question`. Fields and
methods in common are concretely implemented to reduce duplicate code snippets.
** Cons: We need to implement two different `AddTask` commands to support addition of the two different types of tasks.


The class diagram below illustrates how `Task` class is designed:

image::TaskClassDiagram.png[]

* **Alternative 2:** design `Task` as an interface to be implemented by two different classes.
** Pros: More flexible design. Less exposure of internal properties of Task to client.
** Cons: We need to implement all methods in the interface and hence more code snippets are needed. Both implementing
classes have to include the field in common such as `isDone`, which results in duplicate code snippets.

* **Alternative 3:** wrap everything in one concrete `Task` class to support both lecture notes and questions.
** Pros: Less code to write.
** Cons: It violates the principle of Separation of Concern. Hard to maintain or extend in the future if more types of
tasks are needed.

=== Logging

We use `java.util.logging` for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (see <<Implementation-Configuration>>).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`,
which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Log messages are written to the console and to a `.log` file.

*Logging levels*

* `SEVERE`: Indicates a critical (potentially fatal) problem with NUStudy.
* `WARNING`: After this incident NUStudy may continue, but with caution.
* `INFO`: Informational reports about actions taken by NUStudy.
* `FINE`: Strictly only useful for debugging purposes, records all data processed by NUStudy.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

The user preferences file location and logging level can be set through the configuration file,
by default `config.json`.

== Non-functional requirements

. Images must be copied into the application data, residing in a dedicated folder,
rather than merely linking to somewhere on the filesystem
. Export format of lecture notes and flash cards must be human-readable text
. Images must be referenced by pathnames with respect to the image folder

[[lecture-note]] Lecture note::
An object stored in the application model that includes a title, text content and optionally an image.
It is not quizzable.

== Manual testing
A few ways of manually testing NUStudy are listed below. Of course, any tester
should explore more than just these.

=== Opening and closing
. Initial launch
.. Download the JAR file and copy into an empty folder.
.. Open the jar file. _The GUI with some initial application data should be visible._
. Saving window preferences
.. Change the position and size of the window and close it.
.. Re-launch NUStudy. _It should look just like when it was closed._

=== Image support
. Adding a lecture note with an image
.. Type `addnote t/t c/c i/` in the command line. _An image dialog should be brought up._
.. Select any image. _It should appear in the lecture note panel, as a new lecture note with
title "t" and content "c"._
. Modifying an image
.. After adding one lecture note with an image, type `editnote i i/` where `i` is its index.
.. _The same image dialog should be brought up_; select a different image.
_This image should appear in place of the old image, if any, even if the filename is the same._
. Local copy of images
.. Close the application and move the JAR file and its associated application data to another location.
.. Relaunch the application. _Images should display as before.
. Silent ignoring of broken images
.. Once lecture notes with images have been added, close NUStudy and delete all images
in its data folder.
.. Relaunch the application. _The app should not throw an exception, merely not display any images._
.. Add back the images to the lecture notes using `editnote`. _This operation should succeed._
