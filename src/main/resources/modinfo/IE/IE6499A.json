    "description": "This course describes a variety of Metaheuristic search methods including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, dynamically dimensioned search, particle swarm, differential evolution and multi-objective methods. The course also describes the use of sophisticated surrogate optimization algorithms for computationally expensive functions (including objective functions that are computed from a complex computer code.) The algorithms can be used to find values of discrete and/or continuous variables that optimize system performance, improve model forecast ability, and improve system reliability. All methods search for the global optimium and are derivative-free.",
