= Tishya Khanna - Project Portfolio
_


== Introduction

This project portfolio has been written to elaborate on my
contributions to a *team-based software engineering project* in the NUS Computing
module CS2103T.

In this module, my team of five was tasked to create an application, by morphing
the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book - Level 3].

=== Constraints
We had the the following constraints:

*Target Consumer:*::
* The product should be targeting users who can type fast and prefer typing over other means of input.

Solution::
* For this constraint, we ensured that the majority of the user's interactions with the application are through
the https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3337/command-line-interface-cli[_Command Line Interface (CLI)_], which implies that
users have to type commands and instructions, instead of using a Graphical User Interface(GUI).


*Application requirements:*::

* The product has to be https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24409/brownfield[_Brownfield_].

Solution::
* This means that we had to
[.underline]#morph# the existing https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book] into another application.
However, we were allowed to transform the concept of the application by incrementally changing the code.



=== Product - TravEzy

Keeping the above constraints in mind, we created *TravEzy*, a desktop-based CLI travel application.
Our application [.underline]#erases# the logistical nightmare that haunts regular travellers.


Instead of having to deal with several applications to organise and document
a single trip, users can now combine critical travel applications such as
calendars, itinerary planners, diaries and budgeting tools into one convenient
and intuitive interface.

Our product is for NUS students who are avid travellers. Given their
busy schedules and love for travelling, *TravEzy* is the optimal
solution for their travel needs.

=== Overview of my contributions

I took up the responsibility of implementing the _Diary Feature_ , end to end, in TravEzy. While this was my main task, I also
worked on the common code base and design.

In addition, I provided structure and content for critical documentation such as the User and
Developer guides. I shall elaborate more in the following sections.


== Summary of contributions

Given that the largest feature that I implemented was the Diary, I have discussed it in detail below.

=== Diary Feature

image::DiaryPPP.png[width=400]

*Introduction to the feature:*

* The Diary Feature represents a real-life diary. In this implementation, every user has a _Diary Book_ which contains a list (in the form of a _Diary List_) of all
his/her _Diary Entries_.

*Market Validation:*

* As part of our market validation process, we observed that most student travellers enjoy journaling and recording their trips in a text format.
This feature allows for users to do exactly that, with some additional features to increase convenience and usability.

==== Highlights:

Other than being able to  add, delete and display diary entries, this implementation of the diary feature also allows users to find specific
entries and encrypt private memories to keep them safe.

=====  ``find`` and ``findSpecific``

Looking through a large number of diary entries can be challenging, and that's why,
I implemented a basic ``find`` command which allows users to run through all their entries quickly and find entries
which match their query. The ``findSpecific`` command takes this functionality to the next level by allowing users to segment their diary entries
based on the different componenets of an entry (Title, Date etc)

=====  ``setDetails``

Most diaries are for personal thoughts and opinions, and thus, I implemented the  ``private`` command which allows users to
protect their memories. In order to further safeguard entries, I implemented the ``setDetails`` command which allows
users to password protect their memories. Finally, to fully protect the users, I encrypted their data to ensure that no
unauthorised users can read private information straight from the storage files.

== Contributions to the User Guide



In this section, I shall be sharing some of the portions from the *TravEzy* Userguide which I wrote.
I shall be focusing on the ``find``, ``findSpecific`` and ``setDetails`` commands.
They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users.

=== Find diary entries ``find``

"Hey, when did I go to Spain?" It can be hard to remember
all the details of your trips. That's why, this _Diary_ lets you look through all your entries quickly, to give you the entry that *you* want!

*Format:* +
``find TARGET``

*Example:*

    find rugby

TIP: To search for _Dates_, enter them in the same format as before, when you added the _Diary Entry_ (dd/mm/yyyy HHMM)

*Step by step:*

That was the craziest Rugby World Cup ever! Who lost?

Step 1: Type ``find rugby`` into the _User Input Box_ and press _Enter_ on the keyboard. You can refer to the picture below, where the number *1* is.


image::DiaryFindBefore.png[width=400]

Step 2: TravEzy will tell you if your `find` command was successful in the _Result Display_, as can be seen where the number *2* is, in the picture below.

Step 3: You can see the matching _Diary Entries_ in your _Diary List Panel_, similar to number *3* in the picture below.



image::DiaryFindAfter.png[width=400]




=== Find specific diary entries ``findSpecific``

Let's narrow down your search! The _Diary_ allows you to look through specific sections of each _Diary Entry_ to find the exact entry that you want!


*Format:* +
 ``findSpecific [t/TITLE] [d/DATE TIME] [p/PLACE] [m/MEMORY]``

*Example:*


    findSpecific d/12/12/2019


*Step by step:*


You know that you had a trip on the 12th of December 2019, but you can't remember what you did...


Step 1: Type ``findSpecific d/12/12/2019`` into the _User Input Box_ and press _Enter_ on the keyboard. You can refer to the picture below, where the number *1* is.

image::DiaryFindSpecificBefore.png[width=400]

Step 2: TravEzy will tell you if your `findSpecific` command was successful in the _Result Display_, as can be seen where the number *2* is, in the picture below.

Step 3: You can see the specific matching _Diary Entries_ in your _Diary List Panel_, similar to number *3* in the picture below.



image::DiaryFindSpecificAfter.png[width=400]


=== Keep your diary protected ``setDetails``

You never know who may use your laptop when you're away. The _Diary_ can help you to protect your memories to stop hackers from looking at your private memories with a _username_ and _password_.
If you ``setDetails``, you will not be able to use the ``unprivate`` command and will have to use the ``unlock`` command (See below).

*Format:* +
``setDetails user/USERNAME password/PASSWORD``

*Example:*


    setDetails user/youcanthackme password/youreallycanthackme


WARNING: You can only set your details once! After that, you will have to delete TravEzy if you forget your password and need to unlock entries. This is done to ensure *NO ONE* misues your personal information


TIP: Keep your username and password long to keep those pesky hackers out! Minimally, make sure your username and password are alphanumeric and 8 characters long


*Step by step:*


Better set a password to protect your memories against prying eyes

Step 1: Type ``setDetails user/youcanthackme password/youreallycanthackme`` into the _User Input Box_ and press _Enter_ on the keyboard. You can refer to the picture below, where the number *1* is.


image::DiarySetDetailsBefore.png[width=400]


Step 2: TravEzy will tell you if your `unprivate` command was successful in the _Result Display_, as can be seen where the number *2* is, in the picture below.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Given below is a sample of the sections that I contributed to the Developer Guide.
They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.


=== Sequence of Find Command
.Sequence Diagram for the Find Command


image::DiaryFindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=400]


Above, we have the sequence diagram for the ``FindCommand`` in the _Diary_. In this case, we have taken the scenario of finding any `DiaryEntries` which contain the word "temp".

Process:

. Upon receiving the instruction from ``Logic`` to parse the input `find temp`, the ``DiaryBookParser`` begins parsing the input to match it (based on the _Command Word_) to the appropriate _Parser_

. In this case, given that the _Command Word_ is ``find`` the appropriate _Parser_ is the ``FindCommandParser``, which is created and then begins to ``parse("temp")``

. This in turn creates a new ``FindPredicate``, based on the input ``temp``. This ``FindPredicate`` will be used to filter through the ``DiaryModel`` to get the matching ``DiaryEntries``

. With the ``FindPredicate``, a new ``FindCommand`` is created which is returned to logic and executed

. This execution leads to the ``find(temp)`` command being executed on the ``DiaryModel``, which returns the updated ``DiaryModel`` with the matching ``DiaryEntries``

. This model is then returned to the user in the form of the ``Command Result``, and is visible on the GUI in the form of a list of the matching `DiaryEntries`.


NOTE: The lifeline for FindCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


=== Logic of Unprivate and Unlock  Commands


Given the similar function of the 2 commands, ``unprivate`` and ``unlock``, there is a more detailed explanation of the differences between the commands below.


.Activity Diagram for the Unprivate Command

image::DiaryUnPrivateActivityDiagram.png[width=400]


Above, is the logical flow for the Unprivate Command. In brief, it allows a user to unprivate any private entry *IF* there are no ``Details`` set. As a result, the command can be input like this:

``unprivate 1``

NOTE: `1` is the index of the Diary Entry which is to be unprivated

.Activity Diagram for the UnLock Command

image::DiaryUnLockActivityDiagram.png[width=400]

Above, is the logical flow for the Unlock Command. In brief, it allows a user to unlock any private entry *IF* there are ``Details`` and the ``Details`` input by the user match the original ``Details`` set by the user.As a result, the command can be input like this:

``unlock 1 user/username password/password``

NOTE: `1` is the index of the Diary Entry which is to be unlocked and ``user/username`` and ``password/password`` are the relevant Details.


In summary, the ``unlock`` command is only to be used when the user has already set ``Details``. Otherwise, the user has to use the ``unprivate`` command to see private ``DiaryEntries``
