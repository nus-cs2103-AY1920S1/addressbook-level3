    "description": "Known as the \u2018rainforests of the sea\u2019 coral reefs occupy <0.1% of the world\u2019s oceans yet they contain 25% of all the planet\u2019s marine species. Unfortunately, the very existence of coral reefs is threatened by climate change. In this module students will gain an appreciation for coral reefs, their ecology, the evolutionary process responsible for creating this incredible biodiversity, and the threats that climate change and humans pose to these fragile ecosystems. Additionally, we will examine sustainable practices and lifestyle choices that can help reduce human impact on these essential marine habitats.",
