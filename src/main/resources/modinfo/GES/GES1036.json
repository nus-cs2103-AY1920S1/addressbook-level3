    "description": "Ever wonder how many different museums theatres, concert halls, and art events there are in Singapore and why they exist? Why did Singapore recently renovate Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall? This course is a study of Singapore arts in the present, but arranged in relationship with its past and its relationship with the global arts community. Students are required to attend multiple indoor and outdoor art events, from museums, galleries and performance halls to the street as the stage as part of the course requirements.",
