    "description": "Students will learn fundamentals, methods, and software for formulating and solving optimization problems related to chemical engineering. They will study various methods of linear/nonlinear and unconstrained/constrained programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate solution algorithms and/or software for solving a given problem. Guest lecturer with extensive industrial experience in the optimization area will discuss many case studies in reality, to demonstrate how these theoretical tools can be used.",
