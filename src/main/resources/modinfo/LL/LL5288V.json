The second looks at the regulation of key industrial and service sectors, such as food, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, energy chemicals or financial services. The third looks at how EU business regulation interacts with non EU markets, through studying its commercial policy, free trade agreements and extraterritorial jurisdiction.",
