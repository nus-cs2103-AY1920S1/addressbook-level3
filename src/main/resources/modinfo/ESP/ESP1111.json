    "description": "Students will learn engineering fundamentals like forces & equilibrium, dynamics and understand how materials and structures work and fail. They will also learn the importance of safety in conducting engineering activities, units and dimensions, significant numbers, how to make good guesses to solve engineering problems, vector mechanics and create engineering drawings. The students apply these concepts through building a wooden tower, taking full control of its design, modelling and construction. They will test their towers on a shake-table, and the team with the best design, based on a pre-determined set of metrics, will be given due recognition.",
