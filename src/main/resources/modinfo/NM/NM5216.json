    "description": "Advanced Health Communication explores the diverse theoretical and pragmatic views of health communication for the conduct of health interventions and campaigns by targeting multiple audiences and health-related outcomes and using multiple communication channels. Therefore, by seeking to influence both the societal systems and our personal behaviours, this module covers the comprehensive subareas of communication such as interpersonal communication, organisational communication, socio-cultural influences, media and technology in the context of health communication. By considering the value-laden nature of health communication, this module also investigates the ethical dilemmas that arise in decisions about planning, implementing, and evaluating health communication campaigns.",
