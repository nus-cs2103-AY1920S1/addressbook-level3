    "description": "This module covers the advanced theorems in electromagnetism and their applications in both microwave- and optics-related problems. Topics include: diffraction of electromagnetic waves; dyadic Green\u2019s functions in (i) Cartesian, (ii) cylindrical, and (iii) spherical configurations; Huygens' principle; kDB analysis for anisotropic and bi-anisotropic materials to design polarization converter; reflection and transmission of negative-index material; advanced scattering theory for radially anisotropic cylindrical and spherical particles; the application of advanced scattering theory in invisibility cloak design; transformation optics method and space deformation.",
