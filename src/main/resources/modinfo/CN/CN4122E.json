    "description": "This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes.",
