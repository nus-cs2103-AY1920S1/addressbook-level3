Let's say you want to edit the 2nd visit report of a patient and the patient is the 3rd name in the list.

1. Type `editvisit 3 i/2` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
+
[.text-center]
image::UGEditVisit1.png[width="500"]
+
2. Key in the details in the respective fields of the pop-up form(which is pre-filled with the existing information of the report) that appears.
+
[.text-center]
image::UGEditVisit2.png[width="500"]
+
* Press kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[Tab] to navigate to the next field (down)
* Press kbd:[SHIFT] + kbd:[Tab] to navigate to the previous field (up)
3. Click the kbd:[Save] button or press kbd:[F2] to save your edits.
4. The pop-up form closes and the display box will display a message indicating a successful entry.

[.text-center]
image::UGEditVisit3.png[width="500"]

An error will be thrown if the report with the given report index does not exist or the index given is not a number.

[.text-center]
image::UGEditVisit4.png[width="500"]

==== Deleting a visitation report : `deletevisit`

Deletes the specified visitation report. +
Format: `deletevisit INDEX [d/REPORT_INDEX]`

[NOTE]
If no report index is specified, `deletevisit INDEX` or `deletevisit INDEX d/` will open a panel showing the reports of that patient and their relevant indexes of the reports. To delete the visit, simply re-enter the command with the desired report index.

[.text-center]
image::UGDeleteVisit0.png[width="500"]

*Example*:

Let's say you want to delete the 1st visit report of a patient and the patient is the 2nd name in the list.

1. Type `deletevisit 2 d/1` into the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
+
[.text-center]
image::UGDeleteVisit1.png[width="500"]
+
2. A panel showing the list of reports will be shown, now without the deleted report and the display box will display a message indicating a successful deletion.

[.text-center]
image::UGDeleteVisit2.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
An error will be thrown if the report with the given report index does not exist or the index given is not a number.

[.text-center]
image::UGDeleteVisit3.png[width="500"]

For both `deletevisit` and `editvisit` commands if the patient has no past records, a pop up with the message "Patient has no past records" will be shown instead of a list of reports when `editvisit [INDEX]` or `deletevisit [INDEX]` is run. Note that an error will be raised if the report index is provided to a patient with no past records, for example `editvisit [INDEX] i/1` or `deletevisit [INDEX] d/1`.

=== *Appointment System*

====
VISIT also enables doctors to keep abreast and up-to-date on any events or deadlines as VISIT can be customized to remind them of any follow-up visits or other timed reminders.

There are two kinds of Appointments: Follow-Ups and Reminders.

You can only have one active Appointment of the same title, adding the same Appointment with a different day count will simply update the existing Appointment.

Follow-ups in this version do not update if you change the name of the patient after the follow-up is created.
====

==== Adding a follow-up visit with patient : `followup`

Adds a follow-up visit for a particular patient. You can add one even if you have never had a visit with the patient in the past. The application will keep track of when your next appointment with the patient is on the Appointments window. +
Format: `followup INDEX [d/DAYS]`

[TIP]
The follow-up entry will by default generate the follow-up for 7 days' time if not specified.

*Examples*:

* `followup 9 d/10` +
Creates a follow-up entry on patient with index 9 for 10 days later.
* `followup 1` +
Creates a follow-up entry on patient with index 1 for 7 days later.

[.text-center]
image::UGApptFollowUps.png[width="500"]

==== Creating a generic reminder : `reminder`

Creates a new reminder to show up in the Appointments window. +
Format: `reminder TEXT [d/DAYS]`

[TIP]
The reminder entry will by default generate the prompt for 7 days' time if not specified.

*Examples*:

* `reminder Two Point Hospital closed d/10` +
Creates a reminder "Two Point Hospital closed" that will display for the next 10 days.
* `reminder Losartan recall` +
Creates a reminder "Losartan recall" that will display for the next 7 days.

[.text-center]
image::UGApptReminders.png[width="500"]

==== Removing an Appointment : `removeappt`

Remove an appointment from VISIT. This can be either a Follow-up or Reminder. +
Format: `removeappt DESCRIPTION [d/DAYS]`

[TIP]
Any appointment matching just the description will be removed if the specific days is not specified.

*Examples*:

* `removeappt Two Point Hospital closed` +
Removes any appointment which description is "Two Point Hospital closed".
* `removeappt Satya Nadella` +
Removes any appointments with the patient whose name is Satya Nadella.

[.text-center]
image::UGApptRemoveAppt.png[width="500"]

==== Show Appointments "Message of the Day" box : `show`

Shows a pop-up containing the appointments. This is useful if you want to keep a small window just containing the appointments on the screen, separate from the main window. +
Format: `show`

[.text-center]
image::UGApptShow.png[width="500"]

==== Sort Appointments : `sort`

Sorts the appointments in order of type, days remaining, and finally by name. +
Format: `sort`
// end::appointments[]

=== *Optimization for Command-Line Interface (CLI) Users*

====
VISIT being an application optimized for doctors who are comfortable with CLI, has support for features such as aliasing for commands to enable command entries which are often used to be stored and used quickly and easily.
====

==== Setting a shorthand command / alias : `alias`

Set an alias for a command to enable faster command entry for a customized input. This command will override your previous mapping for the alias if there exists a prior mapping. Additionally, using existing commands as aliases is disallowed. +
Format: `alias l/SHORTHAND v/COMMAND`

*Examples*:

* `alias l/ls v/list` +
Typing `ls` now works equivalently as typing `list`.
* `alias l/display all patients v/list` +
Typing `display all patients` now works equivalently as typing `list`.

[.text-center]
image::UGAddAlias.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
The `alias` command will override any previous alias mapping if any. +
All your aliases are saved across multiple sessions and are persistent until removed.

==== Removing a shorthand command / alias : `unalias`

Delete an existing alias, if it exists. +
Format: `unalias SHORTHAND`

*Examples*:

* `unalias ls` +
Typing `ls` will no longer be equivalent to typing `list`.

[.text-center]
image::UGUnalias.png[width="500"]

==== Showing all existing shorthand commands / aliases : `aliaslist`

Show all existing aliases. +
Format: `aliaslist`

Examples:

* `aliaslist` +
Shows all the existing aliases.

[.text-center]
image::UGAliasList.png[width="500"]

==== Using aliases
To use a user-defined alias, you just have to type the alias you defined. Additional optional parameters can also be specified if the aliased command takes in additional arguments. +
Format: `SHORTHAND [additional arguments]`

Examples:

[.text-center]
image::UGApplyAlias.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
Matching of aliases uses the longest substring match. (i.e. if there exists an alias _follow 7_ and _follow_, typing _follow 7_ will always match with _follow 7_ instead of _follow_.)

=== *Saving the data*

VISIT's address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

[[Upcoming-Features]]
=== *Upcoming Features*
The following features are intended for a later release of VISIT that will further expand on the managing power doctors will be able to execute using the application.

==== Inventory System `[Coming in v2.0]`

VISIT v2.0 will include an inventory system for doctors to manage and organise their medical stores.
Doctors will be able to generate the list of medication in their stock and assign them to patients using the app
, which automatically deducts from that list. +
Warnings of low stocks are also an intended feature.

==== Profile Data Encryption and .pdf exporting `[Coming in v2.0]`

In v2.0, VISIT will allow you to export Patient data from VISIT with greater assurances on confidentiality with .pdf exporting, enabling password encryption for exported Profiles.

==== Generating of Medical Certificates `[Coming in v2.0]`

In v2.0, VISIT will allow you to easily generate an official Medical Certificate with a single command.

==== Microsoft Azure Integration `[Coming in v2.0]`

Microsoft Azure is a popular Cloud Computing platform that allows for data analysis, remote deployment and user
authentication resources. We plan to leverage this power in VISIT v2.0 so that you may securely access
VISIT from any location, truly bringing VISIT on-the-go.

==== Improved UI `[Coming in v2.0]`

With more features being added in v2.0, the UI will be reworked to allow new and old features to have
great accessibility and usability. The new UI will utilise a dashboard system so that Doctors
are able to view more information as we scale up VISIT's functionality. Each tab in the dashboard
will represent a feature, i.e. The Appointment list will be a tab containing a Calendar view that
tracks reminders and followups by the date and time, with a pop up notification on launch and near deadlines.

== FAQ

*Q*: _How do I transfer my saved patient and visit data to another Computer?_ +
