    "description": "This course teaches students how to analyse and visualise the urban built environment. Students learn about different city morphologies and the cultural, political and economic reasons they formed. Students will learn about how to discern, describe and depict elements in the urban built environment and do so at a range of scales - block, street, neighbourhood, city. They will also explore the ways in urban design engages with and seeks to re-shape cityscapes. This course includes practical training in manual and digital visualisations. It meets the requirements of either a topical or methods (spatial reasoning) course in Urban Studies.",
