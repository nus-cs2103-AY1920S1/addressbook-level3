    "description": "Molecules never sit still. They jiggle, bend, twist and spin erratically. While the movement of individual molecules is impossible to anticipate, the collective behavior of large numbers of molecules can be predicted with surprising precision. In this short course, you\u2019ll learn how random processes play an essential role in the world around us. Our discussion will be driven by data from real experiments in physics and biology. You\u2019ll learn some of the basic mathematics of random variables, and use a computer to simulate random processes. You\u2019ll apply these ideas to the behavior of individual molecules and explore how predictable, and sometimes surprising, behavior can emerge in large systems. Examples will focus on the physics of everyday materials as well as biology at the molecular and cellular scales.",
