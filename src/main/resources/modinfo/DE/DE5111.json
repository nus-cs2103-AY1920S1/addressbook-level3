    "description": "Managing and ensuring the sustainable use of the marine environment in the tropics is one of man?s greatest challenges today. Tropical coastlines support some of the highest densities of human population worldwide. The high biodiversity in unique habitat also provide rich fisheries and mineral resources. Prudent management of such a complex ecosystem requires a good knowledge and understanding of not only its physical, chemical and biological components, but also the interactions between these components. The nature of these interactions is often unique to the tropics, and most of these are poorly understood. The module provides a systematic approach to understanding the nature of the tropical environment, drawing from local, regional and international examples. Impacts of human activities, and the tools and techniques needed for management, will be discussed. The course is directed at students at the post-graduate level from the M.Sc. (Environmental Management) Programme, but is also suitable for graduates in other faculties in the University interested in this field, particularly those in Science and Engineering.",
