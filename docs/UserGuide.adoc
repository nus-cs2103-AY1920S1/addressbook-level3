== Introduction

Are you a teaching assistant that is *struggling* to keep up with the additional responsibility of teaching a class?

Do you sometimes *wish* that there was an easier way to organize and filter through your students?

As a broke uni student, do you *desperately* need a tool to keep track of your earnings?

##### Look no further! TutorAid is the one stop solution to answer all of your TA woes!

TutorAid is for teaching assistants or tutors who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their classes and related tasks. TutorAid helps in organizing all the information you need in one place so that you can optimize your workflow.
More importantly, TutorAid is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This User Guide was written to help you understand and familiarize yourself with all the commands TutorAid has to help you get started.

If you can type fast, TutorAid can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

=== Tasks

// tag::tasks[]
==== Adding task: `add_task`

Adds a task to one or more time slots. +
Format: `add_task c/MODULE mark/STATUS tt/TASK_TIME...`

[TIP]
A task can have more than one time slots. +
STATUS should only be Y or N. +
`TASK_TIME` should be in the format "dd/MM/YYYY HH:mm, dd/MM/YYYY HH:mm". +
If there are multiple task times, they will be automatically sorted based on their starting time. +
Mark indicates whether a Reminder will be created for this task. +
The Reminder created will have the Task's `MODULE` as its `DESCRIPTION` and the Task's `TASK_TIME` as its `DATE`.



Examples:

* `add_task c/CS2103T mark/Y tt/13/09/2019 13:00, 20/09/2019 16:00 tt/21/09/2019 13:00, 21/09/2019 15:00`
* `add_task c/MA1521 Tutorial mark/N tt/02/11/2020 14:00, 02/11/2020 15:00`

image:UserGuide/add_task.png[width="500"]
image:UserGuide/add_task_2.png[width="500"]

****
* The Reminder created will have the Task's `MODULE` as its `DESCRIPTION` and the Task's `TASK_TIME` as its `DATE`.
****

// end::tasks[]
==== Editing task: `edit_task`

Update task information. +
Format: `edit_task INDEX [c/CLASSID] [mark/STATUS] [tt/TASK_TIME]`

[TIP]
INDEX must be a positive integer. +
At least one element inside task should be edited. +
If key in a Task Time, it can be empty.


Examples:

* `edit_task 1 c/CS2103` +

image:UserGuide/edit_task.png[width="500"]
image:UserGuide/edit_task_2.png[width="500"]

* `edit_task 1 tt/19/10/2019 12:00, 19/10/2019 14:00 mark/N`

****
* If the task `Mark` was originally N and the user edited it to Y, a Reminder for the Task *WILL NOT* be created. Reminders will only be created at the creation of the task.
* Likewise, editing the `Mark` from Y to N will not delete the Reminder that was created at the creation of said Task.
****


==== Deleting task: `delete_task`

Deletes selected task. +
Format: `delete_task INDEX`

[TIP]
INDEX must be a positive integer.

Examples:

* `delete_task 1` +

image:UserGuide/delete_task.png[width="500"]
image:UserGuide/delete_task_2.png[width="500"]

****
* Deleting a task does not delete the Reminder associated with it.
* Senario: After creating a Task with `Mark`, Y, a Reminder will be created as well. User deleted said task with `delete_task` command. This removes the task but not the Reminder.
* If the user creates a new Task with the same description as a Reminder, and `Mark` Y, the program would create the Task, then attempt to create the Reminder and this would cause a __Duplicate Reminder Error__ .
* To prevent this, remember to deleted associated Reminder as well.
****

==== Finding tasks based on Module : `find_task_by_module`

Find specific tasks by Module and list them. +
Format: `find_task_by_module MODULE ...`

****

* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `2100` will not match `CS2100`
* Can find using more than one `MODULE` at a time.
****

Examples:

* `find_task_by_module cs2100`

image:UserGuide/find_task_1.png[width="500"]

==== Finding tasks based on Date : `find_task_by_date`

Find specific tasks by Date and list them. +
Format: `find_task_by_date DATE`

****
* The `DATE` should be in the format dd/MM/YYYY. e.g 12/10/2019

==== Listing all tasks : `list_task`

List all tasks. +
Format: `list_task`

//tag::calendar[]
==== Calendar View

Views the Task in Calendar View

[TIP]
Clicking on a date will show the user the Tasks with that date as its Start Time in normal list view. +
The Calendar will display the tasks starting on that date and the amount of tasks starting on that date. +
If there is a Task starting on that date, only the Task's `DESCRIPTION` and `START_TIME` will be displayed on the calendar.


****
* The maximum number of tasks that can be shown on each date is 2. If there are more than *2* tasks on a date, a `...` will be added at the bottom of that date to indicate that there are more tasks not shown.
* The Calendar will display the tasks starting on that date and the amount of tasks starting on that date. +
* If there is a Task starting on that date, only the Task's `DESCRIPTION` and `START_TIME` will be displayed on the calendar.

// tag::customCommands[]
=== Learn wrong commands as custom commands
To help map the command you entered wrongly into TutorAid to the command you originally intended to execute.

Example:
Let's say you frequently use the `add` command but can never remember it and always type in `plus` instead.
This feature helps you map `plus` to `add` so you no longer need to remember the `add` command.

To learn the wrong command `plus` as `add`:

. You want to do an `add` command but carelessly type in `plus` instead and accidentally hit Enter to try and execute the wrong command.
+
image::step1.png[width="800", align="left"]

. Oh no! TutorAid does not know what `plus` means! You realise you've entered an unknown command. Thankfully, TutorAid offers to help you learn `plus`. You should type in `add` now since it's what you actually intended to do. Hit Enter!
+
image::step2.png[width="800", align="left"]
[NOTE]
You can also choose to discard the wrong command at this stage and carry on with normal operations if you do not want to map `plus` to `add`. Just type `cancel` to go back to normal mode. Please also note that you can only type command words such as `add` or `find` at this stage. Typing full commands like `add n/Caesar c/CS2101` results in an error.

. The result box tells you that `plus` has now been mapped to `add`.
+
image::step3.png[width="800", align="left"]

. Let's test our new command by trying to add a student named John in our CS2101 class. Type in `plus n/John c/CS2101` and hit Enter.
+
image::step4.png[width="800", align="left"]

. You should see that the command is successful and a new student called John in CS2101 has been added!
+
image::step5.png[width="800", align="left"]
// end::customCommands[]

// tag::deleteCustomCommands[]
==== Delete a custom command: 'deleteCustomCommand'
To delete a custom command you previously added.
Format: `deleteCustomCommand CUSTOMCOMMAND`

Example:
Let's try to delete the `plus` command you learned as `add` previously.

. Type in `deleteCustomCommand plus` and hit Enter.
+
image::step1Delete.png[width="800", align="left"]

. The result box informs you that they've deleted the custom command `plus`.
+
image::step2Delete.png[width="800", align="left"]

. You should no longer be able to use `plus` as `add`.
[NOTE]
You can't use `deleteCustomCommand` to delete basic commands like `add`, `delete`, `list` etc. You can only delete custom commands you added.

// end::deleteCustomCommands[]
=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book. +
Format: `clear`

// tag::undoAndRedo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the Tutor Aid to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the Tutor Aid's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` ...).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

image:UserGuide/undo_1.png[width="500"]
image:UserGuide/undo_2.png[width="500"]
image:UserGuide/undo_3.png[width="500"]
image:UserGuide/undo_4.png[width="500"]

* `list_task` +
`find_earnings` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`edit_task 1 mark/N` +
`undo` (reverses the `edit_task 1 mark/N` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

As of the current implementation, hashing is implemented in the account password. With this encryption, malicious user will not be able to view the content despite they have the access to the computer.
However, we plan to provide a better encryption with SHA256 for our password hashing and AES128 for all the data save in the TutorAid as soon as v1.5 to provide a better security protection.
