    "description": "This module is aimed at providing students with essential information on the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and the critical ability to understand/analyse their modern transformations. It begins with the factors leading to the mass migration of Chinese to Southeast Asia in the mid-19th century and the internal structure of Chinese communities in the region. The focus is on their economic, political, cultural activities, identity transformation as well as their contributions towards the region's development since the early 20th century, especially after the end of World War II. The course will also examine the role of ethnic Chinese in the socio-cultural interactions between China and Southeast Asia.",
