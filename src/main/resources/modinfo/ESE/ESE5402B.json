    "description": "This course introduces biological technologies that can be used for the treatment of different industrial wastewater treatment. Characterization of industrial wastewater and different biological processes such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket processes, activated sludge process, membrane bioreactor etc. shall be covered for the removal of organics and nutrients in specific industrial wastewater, producing treated effluents for discharge or water reclamation/wastewater reuse. The students will gain knowledge on the characterization of industrial wastewater, considerations required for the selection of appropriate biological processes and the design of specific biological processes for industrial wastewater treatment.",
