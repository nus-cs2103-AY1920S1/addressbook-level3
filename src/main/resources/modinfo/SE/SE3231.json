    "description": "Through a critical reading of European fiction set in Southeast Asia, students will gain a richer understanding of the region in the colonial period, as well as European experiences and images of Southeast Asia. The module will also reflect on the medium of fiction \u2013 is there something that one can express better through fiction than through academic writing? How do the conventions of academic writing limit what is thought and said? As part of the assessment, students will write short stories. In addition to fiction, we will examine paintings, photographs and watch movies.",
