    "description": "This course will introduce the craft of playwriting to students. It will cover the constituents of the playwright\u2019s toolkit, which include character, plot, theme, form and language. Students will be guided through creative writing exercises where they can apply their knowledge of these different elements while developing a dramaturgical sensibility. There will also be assigned readings, with a focus on contemporary theatre, along with peer critique sessions and theatre excursions. The course will culminate in a dramatised reading of 10-minute plays written by the students and directed and performed by industry professionals. This module can be used to fulfill either Art Practice track or the Creative Writing track in the Arts & Humanities major.",
