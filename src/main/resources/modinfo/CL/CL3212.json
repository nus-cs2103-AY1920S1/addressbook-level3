    "description": "'Trendy' words or chao yu in Chinese represent an emergent class of words and word\u2010like phrases that characterise an aspect of modern Chinese language usage. Like them or loathe them, many such words/phrases are in wide use and many have eventually become a stable part of 'standard' Chinese vocabulary. What can we make of this situation? What are the controversies behind such words/phrases? Are they necessarily impediments to Chinese learning? We will attempt to resolve these questions as well as find ways of describing and analysing these trendy words/phrases linguistically.",
