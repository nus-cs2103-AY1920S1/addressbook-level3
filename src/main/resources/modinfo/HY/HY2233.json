    "description": "This module will be a broad survey of political, diplomatic, economic, social and cultural forces that have globalised Singapore since independence in 1965. The exploration of such themes in the assigned readings by journalists, and scholars in history, sociology and international studies will expose students to a wide range of approaches and discourses. This introduction to Singapore will provide students opportunities to investigate and understand some of the common challenges faced by all newly independent nations of Southeast Asia in devising and implementing policies to cope with international and regional developments.",
