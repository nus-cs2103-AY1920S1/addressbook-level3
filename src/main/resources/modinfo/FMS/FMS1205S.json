    "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce the roles of statistics in science, and how to spot and avoid various fallacies that are common in how laymen understand uncertainty and the scientific method. It will expose misunderstandings of science, deliberate misinformation about scientific results, and even fraud in science, and seek to explain why these arose. The seminar will touch upon almost all aspects of life worth thinking about: food, medicine, experimentation, homeopathy, climate change, terrorism, cigarettes, eggs with two yolks in them, police mergers, ethnic profiling, psychic powers, drugs, human cloning, wars, and the little red light that indicates your television is on standby mode.",
