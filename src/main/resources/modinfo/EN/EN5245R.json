    "description": "This module will train students to read nineteenth and twentieth-century British Literature texts, focusing on gothic novels and their treatment of authority, place and identity. Existing scholarship focuses on the fragmentary and proto-postmodern qualities of gothic narrative and the issue of sites, especially cities and manor houses. This module builds on such scholarship, connecting these perspectives to related themes of property, commodity culture, authority/ policing, transnational flows, the body as a nexus of many of these flows, and the implications of these for identity in a modern age. The module will also make connections between these concerns and the larger issues of fissures and dislocations in identity and society in a transnational age.",
