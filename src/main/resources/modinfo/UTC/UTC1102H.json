    "description": "Made popular by TV dramas such as Law and Order and C.S.I., forensics uses science to aid in law enforcement and crime solving. In this interdisciplinary module, students will be engaged in understanding and discussing the value of various analyses conducted to deduce truth from evidence. Online activities will be paired with active discussions on the history, use and value of forensic analysis. Finally, the credibility of forensic evidence will be discussed, and societal expectations regarding the 'glamorous and exciting' job of the forensic criminologist in CSI compared with the 'messy and morbid' nature of forensics in real life.",
