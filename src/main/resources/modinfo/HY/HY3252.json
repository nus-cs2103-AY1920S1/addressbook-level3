    "description": "This module examines 'tropical' medicine in the three related contexts of colonialism, high imperialism, and nation\u2010building. The module will survey medicine, disease, and epidemics in British, American and Japanese practice, spanning the 18th to 20th centuries, and culminating with present\u2010day Asia and the place of biomedicine in contemporary nation\u2010states, including Singapore. The module covers the transformation of a scientific field from a colonial body of knowledge to a form of practice embraced and utilized by post\u2010colonial societies.",
