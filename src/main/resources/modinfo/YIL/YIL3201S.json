    "description": "The goal of this course is to give students the ability to read literary texts in classical Sanskrit. Taught via teleconference, this course will focus on a selection of the great Indian Epic, the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata is the story of a world ending war between two royal houses and is probably the single most important literary work in India. Using skills developed in the basic and intermediate levels of the language, students will translate and discuss the relevant sections throughout the semester. This course will also discuss a number of advanced and rare grammatical forms in Sanskrit.",
