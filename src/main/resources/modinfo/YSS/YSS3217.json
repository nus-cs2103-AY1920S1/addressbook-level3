    "description": "This course investigates the dramatic urban transformation that has taken place in mainland China over the last four decades. The scale of this transformation means that it has far-reaching consequences for Asia and the world, influencing everything from climate change to the price of bread. The path of Chinese urbanization even affects the likelihood of regional military conflict. Understanding how and why China has urbanized is therefore of critical importance. Over the semester, we will take an interdisciplinary approach to this investigation, using perspectives from history, geography, political science, anthropology, urban planning, and cultural studies, among other disciplines.",
