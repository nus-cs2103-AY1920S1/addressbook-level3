    "description": "Practice research aims to discover new things\n\nabout theatre by doing it, rather than watching\n\nit. This module offers a group project in Theatre\n\nand Performance practice research designed and\n\ndirected by the lecturer. Students are guided in\n\nthe theoretical parameters and issues, project\n\nmethodology, and development of the practical\n\nwork. Through an individual role, each student\n\nconsiders how their practical experience and\n\nknowledge in local contexts interact with theory\n\nand methodology. The module extends over\n\nboth semesters of one academic year to\n\nfacilitate the longer-term growth of practice\n\nresearch outcomes. Admission is by portfolio\n\nsubmission and interviews / auditions.",
