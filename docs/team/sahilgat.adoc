== What you can expect from this document

This document serves as an overview of my contributions to the StudyBuddyPro project. This project was
part of an introductory software engineering module known as *CS2103T*. Moreover,
the document aims to highlight my technical competence and documentation skills by using
the StudyBuddyPro project as an example.

StudyBuddyPro was developed by https://github.com/Sahilgat[me],
https://github.com/Sam-limyr[Samuel Lim],
https://github.com/chanjunren[Chan Jun Ren],
https://github.com/ckb055[Chen Kai Bin] and
https://github.com/jaesimin[Jasmine Yeo Jia Min], all sophomore students from National University of
Singapore (NUS) studying Computer Science.

== What our project is about

StudyBuddyPro is a desktop application designed for university students in computing-related
fields to supplement their revision. StudyBuddyPro aims to consolidate commonly used studying tools
into one integrated platform so the student does not have to fuss about switching between different
applications. This prevents disorganisation and improves convenience.

StudyBuddyPro was developed for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI) to take advantage
of the typing proficiency of computing students. However, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is
also provided for easier viewing, therefore providing the best of both worlds.

StudyBuddyPro's 3 main features are summarized in the table below.

| Feature | Purpose
| Flashcard  | Create flashcards for quick revision and effective retention
| Notes | Create general-purpose notes
| Cheatsheet | Create and customize cheatsheets from relevant content found in Flashcard and Note features

* *Major Feature Enhancements*

** Developed the Flashcard `Model`, `Logic` and `Storage` components. This enhancement provides the functionality for one of
the three core features in the StudyBuddyPro application. Without it, the application would be
missing a key revision tool and the application would be less attractive to the
target market.
*** *What this enhancement included*:
**** The `Flashcard` model and its components such as `Question`, `Answer`, 'Title' and `Statistics` objects and
their respective storage.
**** Basic commands to use the flashcard model such as `add` and `list`. Advanced features such as the *remind* feature.
*** *How deep this feature was*:
**** Implementing this enhancement required a deep technical understanding of the architecture of the
software as it modified 3 out of the 4 major components.
*** *How complete this feature was*:
**** The enhancement is fully functional and goes beyond the basic needs of the user.
**** Advanced features like the *remind* feature makes use of
spaced repetition techniques and automatic reminders so the user can effectively revise.
*** *How much effort was needed to develop this feature*:
**** The enhancement modified and improved existing commands, while also linking various
commands which was very tricky to implement.

* *Minor Feature Enhancements*

** Code quality
*** Refactored `CommandResult` that all other features used to have separate classes to make codebase
more object-oriented. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/pull/195[#195])
*** Refactored `Storage` that all other features used to abide by the interface segregation principle.

== Flashcard Feature

[TIP]
====
Good news - StudyBuddyPro comes with some preloaded flashcards, specially catered for you as a
computing student! Be sure to take a look! Psst - here's a hint for our more tech-savvy
users: You can delete your _flashcards.json_ file in the StudyBuddyPro data folder to restore
these default flashcards at any time. Of course, your current flashcards will be deleted as well!
====

Sick and tired of cramming all your revision at the last minute? Why not give our
Flashcards feature a try! This feature can help you create your very own flashcards to
help you consistently revise. With our built-in reminder features and timetrial modes to
test yourself, use this feature and be on track to better revising habits today!

[IMPORTANT]
====
All the operations in this section assume that the user is in the _flashcard_ mode. To be sure
you are _flashcard_ mode, please ensure you used the `switch fc` command before this. Your
screen should now look like the one found in the screenshot below.

=== Find out what flashcards to revise today, or ones you may have missed: `remind`

This feature helps the user check which flashcards are due for revision today and which flashcards
overdue for revision. StudyBuddyPro automatically sets the date the flashcard should next be
viewed at for optimal learning. These increments also scale with time i.e. newer flashcards will
have to be viewed more often.

[TIP]
Be sure to check in everyday to see which flashcards you have due!

[NOTE]
StudyBuddyPro only marks a flashcard as revised and removes it from the due and
overdue flashcard list when you see the flashcard's _answer_ not just its question! For
example, simply using the `view` command without the `show` command to reveal the flashcard's
answer will not trick the system. Sorry, it's for your own good!

Example usage:

    remind

If no flashcards due for revision today and no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Well done - No due or overdue flashcards!
```

If there are flashcards due for revision today but no overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
```

If there are no flashcards due for revision today but there are overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
```

If there are both flashcards due for revision today and overdue flashcards:

Expected output:
```
Here are the flashcards due today:
1. Math Question 1 - What is 2 x 2?
Here are your overdue flashcards:
1. Math Question 2 - What is 3 x 2? (Was due on 2019-10-30)
```

=== Remind Feature

==== Overview

This feature aims to help the user stay on track with the user's revision schedule through two
other sub-features. The first sub-feature is the `remind` command which helps the user
keep track of which flashcards are due or overdue for revision. The second sub-feature is
integrated with the `exit` command and is illustrated in the activity diagram below. For example,
a typical user may use the `exit` command to exit the application without realizing they still had
due or overdue flashcards left to revise. StudyBuddyPro will automatically warn the user about these
unrevised flashcards after which the user can decide if they wish to revise these flashcards or
exit StudyBuddyPro anyway.

==== Implementation of `Statistics` class

In order to fully understand how the remind feature was implemented, it is important
to understand how a flashcard stores the relevant data fields it needs such as its last viewed
date. All the relevant statistics pertaining to each flashcard is contained within a `Statistics`
object. Each `Statistics` object also has a `ScheduleIncrement`, which helps keep track
of when the flashcard should be next viewed for optimum spaced repetition learning. The relationships between the
`Flashcard`, `Statistics` and `ScheduleIncrement` classes are summarized in the class diagram below.

.Class diagram of `Flashcard`, `Statistics` and `ScheduleIncrement` classes
image::remindDiagrams/RemindCommandModelsClassDiagram.png[]

The interactions between the relevant classes can be illustrated through the following
scenario:

_Today's date is 10/10/2019. Jim decides to view a flashcard which was previously
viewed on 7/10/2019 and was scheduled to be viewed on 8/10/2019._

*Step 1*. Jim views the flashcard, either through a `timetrial` or by specifically finding the
relevant flashcard and viewing the flashcard's answer using the `view` and `show` commands.

*Step 2*. When the relevant command is called, the `Flashcard` object's `Statistics#onView()`
method is invoked to update its statistics.

*Step 3*. The `onView()` method calls its helper functions in the specific order shown in the
code snippet below. The order is significant as calling the `updateToViewNext()` method
before the `increaseIncrement()` method would result in the wrong `ScheduleIncrement` being
used to update the `toViewNext` attribute.

.Code snippet of `Statistics#onView()`
image::remindDiagrams/OnView.PNG[pdfwidth=90%]


*Step 4*. In this case, the "if" clause of the code snippet above is triggered since
the `toViewNext` date _(8/10/2019)_ was *before* the current date _(10/10/2019)_.

*Step 5*. The various helper methods execute their relevant functions to update their
respective fields. For example, the `lastViewed` date is now updated to 10/10/2019.


==== Implementation of `remind` command

[IMPORTANT]
The following commands assume that the user is in the _flashcard_ mode.

The `remind` command is facilitated by the `RemindFeatureUtil` class and extends
the abstract `Command` class as summarized in the class diagram below. This diagram
also provides a summary of the `Logic` components of the `remind` command.

{_Please refer to the complete Developer Guide for the diagram!_}

The `remind` command also interacts with the `Model` component, specifically through indirect
interactions with each `Flashcard` object currently in `StudyBuddyPro`. This was explained
earlier through Figure 3.

The following example serves to provide an overview of the high-level architecture involved for the `remind` command.

*Step 1*. The user types "remind" and executes the command to check what flashcards
the user has due.

*Step 2*. `MainWindow` would call `LogicManager#execute()` to hand over control flow to the
`Logic` component.

*Step 3*. `LogicManager` parses the user input to determine which command is being called.
After determining that a `remind` command is being executed, the relevant `RemindCommand`
object is created.

*Step 4*. The `RemindCommand` object determines which flashcards are due and overdue, if any,
and returns the output packaged in a `FlashcardCommandResult` object.

*Step 5*. `MainWindow` extracts the relevant output to be shown to the viewer from the `FlashcardCommandResult`
and displays it.

These steps are illustrated in further detail in the sequence diagram below.

.Sequence diagram of high-level overview of how the `remind` command works
image::remindDiagrams/RemindFeatureSequenceDiagramMain.png[pdfwidth=90%]

With reference to *Step 4* above, the implementation of how the `RemindCommand` object determines
which flashcards are due or overdue can be further examined. A broad overview is provided
in the sequence diagram below and explained in further detail below the diagram.

.Sequence diagram of checking for due and overdue flashcards
image::remindDiagrams/RemindCommandReferenceSequenceDiagram.png[pdfwidth=90%]

* Whenever a `RemindCommand` object is created, it creates its own `RemindFeatureUtil` object.

* The `RemindCommand` object communicates directly with the `ModelManager` object through
the exposed `Model` interface by calling upon the `ModelManager#getFilteredFlashcardList()` to
get the current list of flashcards in the application.

* The `RemindCommand` passes the list of flashcards to its helper `RemindFeatureUtil` class which
retrieves due and overdue flashcards through the `RemindFeatureUtil#getDueFlashcards()` and
`RemindFeatureUtil#getOverdueFlashcards()` respectively.

* Overdue flashcards are collected by iterating through
the entire flashcard list and checking if each flashcard's `toViewNext` attribute is before
the current system date. A similar approach is adopted to check for due flashcards.

* The two lists of due and overdue flashcards are formatted into a String and passed back
through the `FlashcardCommandResult` object created.

==== Design and Implementation Considerations

The following sections describes the considerations taken into account when developing this feature.

===== Implementation Consideration: How to keep track of when a `Flashcard` object was last viewed?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Design a new `Statistics` class and make a `Flashcard` object store a `Statistics`
object. The `Statistics` object then keeps track of the flashcard's last viewed date.
** Pros: Using a separate `Statistics` class is more in line with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices and means
the same class can be adapted and used to track statistics of other objects in StudyBuddyPro
in the future.
** Cons: Additional class adds additional maintenance and issues such as difficulty
converting this class into a format that can be saved and read.
* **Alternative 2:** Use an integer attribute field in each `Flashcard` object to keep track of how many times it was
viewed.
** Pros: Easier to maintain: The addition of a new class increases overall coupling compared to adding a single new
attribute field.
** Cons: Bad OOP practice and makes it difficult to implement future changes. It may be unclear what the
integer value represents and makes debugging more difficult.

==== [Proposed] Future Improvements
** Improve the formula used for determining when flashcards should be revised.
*** We could take into account other factors such as user confidence level or number of times flashcard was answered
correctly or incorrectly to create a more dynamic reminding schedule.

** Introduce desktop notifications for the user.
*** As a user may not open StudyBuddyPro everyday, StudyBuddyPro can be integrated with the
desktop system calendar to provide notifications when flashcards are due for revision.
