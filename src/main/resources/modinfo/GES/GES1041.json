    "description": "This module examines the ethical dimensions of everyday life in Singapore. It focuses on moral dilemmas that arise in the nation\u2019s pursuit of \u2018happiness, prosperity, and progress\u2019. We will explore how moral reasoning from multiple perspectives applies to local concerns such as equality, meritocracy, multiculturalism, immigration, and marriage. This will challenge us to identify moral problems created by social and technological changes, combine ethical principles with practical constraints, and balance the interests of individuals and communities. We will also consider how moral dialogue can be cultivated in Singapore\u2019s multicultural society, so as to manage diverse traditions and divergent values.",
