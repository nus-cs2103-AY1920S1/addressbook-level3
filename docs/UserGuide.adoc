== Introduction

MYMorise -- Manage Your Money(MYM) is a desktop application for those who *prefer tracking personal expenses on their
computers*. With MYMorise, you can easily see your daily expenses as well as a summary, along with other useful
functionalities. More importantly, MYMorise is *optimized for those who prefer to work with Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface
(GUI)*. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

****
*Things to note in MYMorise:*

* Expense - refers to the cost incurred in or required for something which the user would like to record
* Budget - refers to an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.
* Default expense list - refers to all expenses that do not fall into any budgets in MYMorise.
* The amounts used in MYMorise can only work for numbers up to 2 decimal places.
* MYMorise's GUI consists of 3 display panels:

    The left panel - displays all expenses recorded in MYMorise. User commands do not reference from this panel and should not be made based on this panel. Commands made should reference from the centre panel. The purpose of this panel is solely for displaying all expenses recorded only.

    The centre panel - displays the current view requested by user. All commands made are in relative to the content displayed in this panel. That is, if a user enters the command `listBudgets` or `view 1`, this panel will reflect the content requested. Subsequent commands such as `editExpense` and `editBudget` will reference from this panel. On start up, the centre panel displays the default expense list.

    The right panel - displays the visual graphics of the content shown in the centre panel only.

[TIP]
An expense with no date specified will default to current date and time of addition.
[TIP]
An expense can have any number of tags (including no tags).
[TIP]
User may input time in the format "HHMM" in the [d/DATE] portion to specify current date with specified time
[TIP]
If user wants to add an expense onto the last day of a month, just specify the day to be 31 and it will automatically be added onto the last day of the month. +
E.g., if user wants to add an expense to the last day of April but is unsure of which day is the last day, just specify date to be 31/4/2019 and it will be added to 30th April 2019 (last day of April). +
This tip works on budget dates too!

Examples:

* `expense n/Coffee a/1.80 t/food`
* `expense n/Textbook a/23.50 t/education t/school`

Format: `budget n/NAME a/AMOUNT [c/CURRENCY] d/STARTDATE ed/ENDDATE`

Example: There is an existing budget with
start date 12/1/2019 and end date 18/1/2019, then new budgets to be added cannot have start date and/or
