== Introduction

Welcome to Mark. This developer guide aims to introduce potential developers to the structure and implementation of Mark,
so that you can contribute too!

The guide first covers the high-level design of Mark, and then discusses the implementation of key features and the
rationale behind certain design decisions. Next, it provides links to guides for the tools used in Documentation, Testing,
and DevOps. Finally, the appendices of this guide specify the product scope, requirements, a glossary, and instructions for
manual testing.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

This section shows the design of Mark.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
For example, `LogsCenter` plays an important role at the architecture level as it is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of the following four components:

. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
The following diagram illustrates the structure of the UI component:

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BookmarkListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow` and 'TabView' components (not shown in the above figure), inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The structure of the `TabView` is depicted here:

.Structure of the TabView Component, which is a part of the UI component
image::UiTabViewClassDiagram.png[]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
The following class diagram illustrates the structure of the `Logic` component:

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

`Logic` uses the `MarkParser` class to parse the user command.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a bookmark) and/or `Storage` (e.g. import bookmarks).
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions,
such as displaying help to the user, switching the tab view, or exiting the application.

As an example of how the `Logic` component works, the following sequence diagram shows the interactions
within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `Logic` component does the following:

* Parses and executes user commands
* Modifies `Model` and/or `Storage` according to user commands
* Instructs `Ui` through `CommandResult` objects
// end::logic[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The following class diagram illustrates the structure of the `Model` component:

[[model-class-diagram]]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[Model Class Diagram, 700]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component manages the storage of data in Mark. Hence, it does not depend on any of
the other three components.

As seen in the diagram above, the `Model` consists of the following:

1. `VersionedMark` - contains Mark data
2. `UserPrefs` - represents the user's preferences

The `Model` also exposes several `Observable` properties so that the UI can 'observe' them and update
automatically when `Model` data are changed. For simplicity's sake, some of these dependencies
have been omitted from the Model class diagram. The observable properties are:

[start=3]
. An unmodifiable filtered `ObservableList` of bookmarks - represents the bookmarks that are
currently being displayed in the bookmark list.
. A second filtered `ObservableList` of bookmarks - represents the bookmarks that are currently
being displayed in the favorites panel on the **Dashboard**.
. A `SimpleObjectProperty` of a `Url` - contains the URL of the current web page that can be
seen on the **Online** tab.
. A `SimpleObjectProperty` of a `Bookmark` - represents the Bookmark whose `Offline Copy` is currently
being viewed in the **Offline** tab.

As seen in <<model-class-diagram>>, `VersionedMark` contains a list of `ReadOnlyMark` objects
that represent past or future states of Mark. The class `Mark` implements `ReadOnlyMark`.
Each of the `Mark` objects in `VersionedMark` comprises a `UniqueBookmarkList`
from the `Bookmark` package, a `ReminderAssociation` object from the `Reminder` package, an
`AutotagController` from the `Autotag` package, and a `FolderStructure` from the `FolderStructure` package.

The structure of each package will now be explained in more detail.

.Structure of the Bookmark Package
image::BookmarkPackageClassDiagram.png[Bookmark Package Class Diagram, 600]

The `Bookmark` package contains classes relating to Bookmarks and their attributes, as shown above. The external
class `Mark` contains a `UniqueBookmarkList`, which has one or more `Bookmarks`. As mentioned earlier, the
`Bookmark` class is also accessed by `ModelManager`.

Each `Bookmark` has a `Name`, a `Url`, a
`Remark`, a `Folder`, zero or one `CachedCopy`, and one or more `Tags`. Each `CachedCopy` has its own
set of annotations (in the `Annotation` package).

NOTE: Each Bookmark has a different `Tag` object and a different `Folder` object, even if bookmarks have the same
tag or folder name. More details regarding the implementation of Folders can be found in <<Folders feature>>.

[[annotation-cd]]
.Structure of the Annotation Package
image::AnnotationPackageClassDiagram.png[Annotation Package Class Diagram, 350]

The above diagram shows the structure of the Annotation package, which is accessed by `ModelManager` via `OfflineDocument`.
An `OfflineDocument` consists of zero or more `Paragraph` objects, which are each identified by a `ParagraphIdentifier`.
A `Paragraph` can either be a `TrueParagraph`, which has a `ParagraphContent` and zero or one `Annotation`,
or a `PhantomParagraph`, which has no `ParagraphContent` but must have an `Annotation`.
An `Annotation` consists of a `Highlight` and an `AnnotationNote`.

NOTE: More details regarding the implementation of Annotations can be found in <<Annotation feature>>.

.Structure of the Autotag and Predicates Packages
image::AutotagPackageClassDiagram.png[Autotag Package Class Diagram, 500]

The Autotag package consists of a main `AutotagController` class, which controls one or more `SelectiveBookmarkTaggers`.
The `SelectiveBookmarkTagger` class contains a `BookmarkPredicate` and a `Tag` (inherited from its parent class
`BookmarkTagger`). Each `BookmarkPredicate`, in turn, makes use of a combination of predicates like
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `UrlContainsKeywordsPredicate`, and `FolderContainsKeywordsPredicate` to test
bookmarks.

NOTE: More details regarding the implementation of Autotags can be found in <<Autotag feature>>.

.Structure of the Reminder Package
image::ReminderPackageClassDiagram.png[Reminder Package Class Diagram, 350]

The Reminder package is managed by the `ReminderAssociation` class. It handles the association between a set of
`Reminders` and a set of `Bookmarks`, making sure that the two sets remain synchronised. Each `Reminder` consists
of a `Note` that describes the task to be done and the `Url` of the `Bookmark` it is associated with.

NOTE: More details regarding the implementation of Reminders can be found in <<Reminder feature>>.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The following diagram illustrates the structure of the Storage component:

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/mark/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component does the following:

* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads them back.
* Saves the Mark data in json format and reads it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.mark.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
The Undo and Redo features are crucial to give users the flexibility of reverting wrongly executed commands.
This section explains the implementation of the undo/redo mechanism as well as some design considerations
when implementing this feature.

==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedMark`.
It extends `Mark` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a list of `markStateRecord` and `currentPointer`.
The class diagram for `MarkStateRecord` and its relationship with `ReadonlyMark`, `Mark` and `VersionedMark` is shown below:

image::MarkStateRecordClassDiagram.png[]

As shown in the class diagram, `VersionedMark` implements the following operations:

* `VersionedMark#save(String record)` -- Saves the current Mark state and the corresponding record to its history.
* `VersionedMark#undo(int step)` -- Undoes the given number of actions and returns the record which
consists of the list of actions being undone.
* `VersionedMark#redo(int step)` -- Redoes the given number actions and returns the record which
consists of the list of actions being undone.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveMark(String record)`, `Model#undoMark(int step)` and `Model#redoMark(int step)`
respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedMark` will be initialized with the initial
Mark state and an empty record, and the `currentPointer` pointing to that single state record.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th bookmark in the Mark. The `delete` command calls
`Model#saveMark(String record)`, causing the modified state of the Mark and the record of the command after command execution
to be saved in the `markStateRecords`, and the `currentPointer` is shifted to the newly inserted state record.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add u/www.google.com ...` to add a new bookmark. The `add` command also calls
`Model#saveMark(String record)`,
causing another modified Mark state and the record to be saved into the `markStateRecords`, and the `currentPointer` is
again shifted to the newly inserted state record..

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveMark(String record)`, so the Mark state will not be saved into the
`markStateRecords`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the bookmark was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoMark(1)` since by default the number of steps
to undo is 1 if not specified. This command shifts the `currentPointer` once to the left,
pointing it to the previous state record, and restores the Mark to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentPointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Mark state, then there are no previous Mark states to
restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoMark(1)` to check the if there are enough commands to undo.
In this case, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

[[undo-sequence-diagram]]
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoMark(int step)`, which shifts the `currentPointer` to the right by the given number of steps,
and restores the Mark to the state corresponding to the `currentPointer`.

[NOTE]
If the `currentPointer` is at index `markStateRecords.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Mark state, then there
are no undone Mark states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoMark(1)` to check the if there are enough commands to redo.
In this case, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Mark, such as `find`, will
usually not call `Model#saveMark(String record)`, `Model#undoMark(int step)` or `Model#redoMark(int step)`. Thus, the `markStateRecords` remains
unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveMark(String record)`. Since the `currentPointer` is not pointing at the end
of the `markStateRecords`, all state records after the `currentPointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add u/www.google.com ...` command. This is the
behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::SaveMarkActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

This section explains some of the design considerations we had when implementing this feature.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Mark state.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the bookmark being deleted).
** Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Mark state records.
** Pros: Undo/redo multiple commands can be achieved in O(1) time by just shifting the current pointer.
** Cons: Clear state records after the current pointer can take O(n) time.
* **Alternative 2:** Use two stacks, an undo stack and a redo stack to store the history of Mark state records.
** Pros: Clear state records after the current pointer can be achieved in O(1) time by clearing the redo stack.
** Cons: Undo/redo multiple commands can take O(n) time as each undo/redo action requires popping a state record from the
undo stack and pushing it into the redo stack. There is no way to pop multiple state records efficiently at one time.

===== Aspect: Commands to include for undo/redo
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Include only commands that modify the state of Mark data.
** Pros: Only meaningful app data is stored, less memory is consumed
** Cons: Unable to retrieve commands that do not alter the state of Mark, such as `find`, `list`
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands
** Pros: All commands can be undone and redone
** Cons: More data to be stored and these data might not be meaningful to the users. More data related to
Command class also needs to be stored and VersionedMark might need to depend on Logic which breaks the layered architecture of the existing application

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::autotag[]
=== Autotag feature
==== Implementation

// TODO: rewrite this part
The autotag mechanism is facilitated by the main class `AutotagController`. It stores and manages a list of
`SelectiveBookmarkTaggers`, which represent autotags in the `Model`.

`AutotagController` implements the following operations:

* `AutotagController#hasTagger(SelectiveBookmarkTagger)` -- Checks whether the controller contains the given tagger.
* `AutotagController#addTagger(SelectiveBookmarkTagger)` -- Starts managing the given tagger.
* `AutotagController#applyTaggersToList(List<Bookmark>)` -- Tags the bookmarks in the list using all relevant taggers.
* `AutotagController#applyTaggers(Bookmark)` -- Tags the bookmark using all relevant taggers.

The first three operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasTagger(SelectiveBookmarkTagger)`, `Model#addTagger(SelectiveBookmarkTagger)`,
and `Model#applyAllTaggers()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autotag mechanism behaves at each step.

****
**Step 1**. The user opens the application with an existing list of bookmarks and no autotags.

.The initial state of Mark
image::AutotagState0.png[350, 350]

**Step 2**. The user executes the command `**autotag** Help u/stackoverflow.com/questions` to add an autotag that tags all
bookmarks from **stackoverflow.com/questions** with the tag **Help**.

* A `SelectiveBookmarkTagger` is created with a `BookmarkPredicate` and a `Tag` named **Help**.
The predicate's URL keyword is **stackoverflow.com/questions**.
* The new autotag is applied to bookmark `b2`, which matches the `UrlContainsKeywordsPredicate`. This is carried out by
replacing `b2` with a copy of itself (`b3`) that also contains the tag **Help**.

.The state of Mark after an autotag is added and applied to existing bookmarks
image::AutotagState1.png[400, 400]

**Step 3**. The user then executes the command `**add** n/JavaFX new scene u/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29080759/`
to bookmark a question on StackOverflow.

* A new bookmark with the name `JavaFX new scene` is created.
* This bookmark matches the conditions for the previously added autotag, so it is tagged **Help**.

.The state of Mark after a new bookmark is added and tagged automatically
image::AutotagState2.png[400, 400]

****

The following diagrams show how the `*autotag*` command works in more detail.

The parsing of an `*autotag*` command is done in a similar way as shown in the first half of the
<<undo-sequence-diagram, sequence diagram for the `undo` command>>. This result in the creation of an
`AutotagCommand` that contains a `SelectiveBookmarkTagger` to be added to the `Model`.

When `AutotagCommand#execute(model, storage)` is called, the command first checks whether the given `model` contains
the command's `SelectiveBookmarkTagger` (also known as `tagger`).
If it does not, `tagger` is added to `model`, and all taggers in `model` are then applied to the bookmarks in `model`.
Finally, the current state of Mark is saved with a message that indicates the successful execution of the
`*autotag*` command. This sequence of operations is illustrated in the following diagram:

.Sequence diagram showing the general execution of an `AutotagCommand`
image::AutotagSequenceDiagram.png[300, 300]

The next sequence diagram provides more details of how taggers are applied to bookmarks in Mark.

.Sequence diagram showing the execution of `Model#applyAllTaggers()`
image::ApplyAllTaggersSequenceDiagram.png[500, 500]

NOTE: The **sd** frame should cover the whole diagram, but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it does not.

With reference to the above diagram, the `Model`
first calls the method `VersionedMark#applyAllTaggers()`. `VersionedMark` then obtains its `list` of bookmarks, and
passes the list to its `AutotagController` to apply all `SelectiveBookmarkTaggers` to the list.
The `AutotagController` then iterates through all the bookmarks and taggers, and applies tags to bookmarks using the method
`SelectiveBookmarkTagger#applyTagSelectively(Bookmark)`. A new list of bookmarks is returned, which `VersionedMark`
sets as its bookmark list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when an autotag is added (assuming valid user input).
A similar mechanism is used to tag bookmarks when a bookmark is added or modified.

[[autotag-activity-diagram]]
.Activity diagram showing how an autotag is added
image::AutotagActivityDiagram.png[300, 300]

==== Design Considerations

The following aspects of the autotag mechanism were considered when designing the autotag implementation.

// TODO: ===== Aspect: How autotags are represented

===== Aspect: How autotags are applied

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterate through each autotag and bookmark, then apply tags to all bookmarks that match.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of runtime, as bookmarks can be checked multiple times.
* **Alternative 2:** Check for changes in the bookmark list then edit tags accordingly.
** Pros: Will be faster if most bookmarks are unchanged.
** Cons: More complicated to implement.

===== Aspect: How to apply taggers to a bookmark list in Mark

* **Alternative 1:** Modify individual bookmarks when adding tags.
** Pros: Eliminates the need to reset Mark's bookmark list whenever taggers are applied.
** Cons: Can cause unanticipated changes in other parts of the Model.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Replace the whole bookmark list with a new list of bookmarks, some of which have been tagged.
** Pros: Simple to implement, ensures immutability of bookmarks.
** Cons: Inefficient to construct a new list each time a single bookmark is tagged.
* **Alternative 3:** Replace only those bookmarks that were tagged.
** Pros: Minimises performance issues from creating a new bookmark list.
** Cons: More complicated to implement.
// end::autotag[]

// tag::annotation[]
=== Annotation feature
==== Implementation
The annotation feature builds upon the structure of an offline document used to represent a _Readability4J-derived cache_.
Such an offline document is represented by `OfflineDocument`, which contains at least one `Paragraph`. Each annotation is attached to an entire `Paragraph`. The annotation will be internally stored as an instance of `Annotation`.
You can view the class structure of the annotation feature in the <<annotation-cd, figure above>>.

The annotation feature encompasses this functionality:

 * Add an annotation (triggered by `annotate` command and executed by `AddAnnotationCommand#execute()`).
 * Delete an annotation (triggered by `annotate-delete` command and executed by `DeleteAnnotationCommand#execute()`).
 * Edit an annotation (triggered by `annotate-edit` command and executed by `EditAnnotationCommand#execute()`).

Command  words `annotate`, `annotate-delete` and `annotate-edit` make up the _family of annotation commands_.
When activated, each calls the respective command parser to create the corresponding `AnnotationCommand`.
Subsequently, when necessary the appropriate `Paragraph` is retrieved, and the annotation is handled according to the command.
You can study the hierarchy of the _family of annotation commands_ here:

.Structure of the _family of annotation commands_.
image::AnnotationCommandStructure.png[]

The following sequence diagram illustrates how a command of the _family of annotation commands_ operates:

[[sd-annotation-general]]
.Sequence diagram showing how annotation commands generally work. `cmdStr` is the string representing the command input by the user. `arguments` is `cmdStr` without the command word.
image::AnnotationSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddAnnotationCommandParser` and `AddAnnotationCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


In the <<sd-annotation-general, figure above>>, the specifics of how `Parser#parse` and `AnnotationCommand#execute` are abstracted out.
This is because each of the annotation commands have different input criteria. Hence each command is parsed and handled differently.
The sub-sections below will show you some examples illustrating how each command works.

===== Adding annotations
Adding an annotation works as described by the <<sd-annotation-general, general sequence diagram>>, with the following
sequence diagram referred to by the reference frame:

.Sequence diagram referenced by the <<sd-annotation-general, general sequence diagram for annotations>> when `cmdStr` given is `annotate 1 p/p2 n/example note h/orange`. `ARGS` include `pid`, `highlight` and `note`.
image::AddAnnotationSequenceDiagram.png[]


The above example adds an annotation to a `:TrueParagraph`. Alternatively, if the user chooses to add a general note instead,
`OfflineDocument#addPhantom` is called instead, creating an annotated `:PhantomParagraph`.

NOTE: A `:TrueParagraph`, whose content is from the `cache`, must be highlighted in order to have a note attached. A `:PhantomParagraph` is a temporary holding place for a general note and has no content.

===== Deleting annotations
Users can delete the highlight and/or note of a paragraph or delete all annotations on the document.
Deleting an annotation also works as described by the <<sd-annotation-general, general sequence diagram>>, but with the following
sequence diagram referred to by the reference frame:

.Sequence diagram referenced by the <<sd-annotation-general, general sequence diagram for annotations>> when `cmdStr` given is `annotate-delete 1 p/p2 n/true`. `ARGS` include `pid`.
image::DeleteAnnotationSequenceDiagram.png[]


The above example deletes only the highlight from a `:TrueParagraph` which has a note, and then creates a `:PhantomParagraph` to keep a reference to the note.

For other `annotate-delete` functions, instances of other derived classes of `DeleteAnnotationCommand` is used instead of `:DeleteAnnotationHighlightCommand`.
If the user requests to remove the entire annotation instead, `DeleteAnnotationAllCommand` is used and the `an:Annotation` is simply dereferenced.
If the user requests to remove only the annotation note, `DeleteAnnotationNoteCommand` is used and the `AnnotationNote` of `Annotation` is dereferenced.
Alternatively, if the user requests to remove annotations from all paragraphs, `DeleteAnnotationClearAllCommand` is used and the entire `:OfflineDocument` is dereferenced and a new, unannotated copy is created.

===== Editing annotations
Users can use `annotate-edit` to modify the content of the `AnnotationNote`, colour of `Highlight` or move annotations from one paragraph to another.
Editing an annotation also works as described by the <<sd-annotation-general, general sequence diagram>>, but with the following
sequence diagram referred to by the reference frame:

.Sequence diagram referenced by the <<sd-annotation-general, general sequence diagram for annotations>> when `cmdStr` given is `annotate-edit 1 p/g1 to/p1 h/green`. `ARGS` include `origPid`, `targetPid` and `newHighlight` and `newNote`.
image::EditAnnotationSequenceDiagram.png[]


The above example moves general note `G1` to paragraph `P1` and highlights `P1` green. As per the specifications, users are not allowed to move any annotation to `:PhantomParagraph` using `annotate-edit`, so `targetP` must either be `null` or a `:TrueParagraph`.
However, `origP` can be anything as long as it is an instance of a derived class of `Paragraph`.

The reason why we do not allow users to use this command to make notes general is because there is not much value in doing so given we only support highlights and notes as annotations.
If you want, you can easily extend the edit function to be able to allow moving annotations to the general section.

===== Summmary

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user attempts to annotate their offline document:
//TODO: activity diagram (and also for prev parts rmb to handle edge cases?)

image::AnnotationActivityDiagram.png[]

You are welcome to extend the annotation feature by adding more forms of annotation.

==== Design Considerations
The following are a few design considerations made in deciding how to implement the annotation feature:

===== Aspect: How to structure the offline components to store annotations
Each annotation is tagged to a paragraph and an offline document is composed of multiple paragraphs.
A cached copy has the original cache of the website.
There are hence a few alternatives in which we can combine these elements and store them:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let each `CachedCopy` have an `OfflineDocument` that consists of paragraphs with content parsed from the original cache. Each paragraph contains a annotation, if any.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage and overheads from layers of abstraction.

* **Alternative 2:** Let each cache keep only the original cache of the website. Use another class to store the annotations with the respective paragraph identifiers.
** Pros: Will use less memory since the content of the website is not duplicated.
** Cons: Not straightforward to implement. Stray notes will need a different implementation to order and store them. Objects not well abstracted.

I decided to proceed with Alternative 1 as it is easier to implement and more feasible to implement in light of time constraints. This alternative offers accessibility to
model components that are highly related in functionality.

===== Aspect: How to handle annotation commands
The _family of annotation commands_ includes the three main aspects: add, delete and edit. Each aspect can encompass
more than one kind of use case (e.g. `annotate-delete` can be used to delete the entire annotation from a paragraph; it can also
be used to delete just the highlight of a paragraph, which also makes the attached note, if any, general).
However, all of them manipulate annotations.
This means there are multiple options to choose from to parse an annotation command:

* **Alternative 1:**  Use a single parser to parse all annotation commands.
** Pros: Will likely be faster due to less layers of abstraction.
** Cons: Does not abide by the Single Responsibility Principle and Open-close Principle.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use a different parser for each command word.
** Pros: Easier to implement. This ensures the individual command words are parsed separately and in
a similar way as the other commands, improving the overall clarity of the implementations.
** Cons: Need to write many lines of code due to multiple layers of abstraction.

I decided to proceed with Alternative 2 as it is easy and feasible to implement in light of time constraints. Furthermore,
responsibility is more segregated which makes it easier to manipulate objects to achieve a functionality.

===== Aspect: How to implement command to delete annotations
There are multiple choices when it comes to deleting annotations, each specifically deletes a part or whole of an annotation. In particular, deleting
only the highlight of a paragraph with a note will have a side effect where the note becomes general.
Considering these variations, there are a few alternatives that we can consider to implement the delete function:

* **Alternative 1:** Use a single `DeleteAnnotationCommand` object to execute the entire delete functionality
** Pros: Makes it clear as all related functionality are packaged in the same class.
** Cons: Does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle and Open-close Principle. All checks will have to be performed in the same class, which makes it messy as well.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use a different subtype of `DeleteAnnotationCommand` to represent and execute each use case.
** Pros: Easier to implement since delete functionality is rather discrete and each function is mutually exclusive. Less checks will be required for each class implemented. Also easier to extend functionality in future.
** Cons: Need to write multiple lines of code due to multiple layers of abstraction.

I decided to proceed with Alternative 2 as it is easy and feasible to implement in light of time constraints. Since the individual functions of `annotate-delete` do not overlap,
this alternative makes it less cumbersome to modify if there needed to be a change in delete functionality.

===== Aspect: How to implement command to edit annotations
The edit function for manipulating annotations also has multiple functions: editing existing
annotations and moving annotations from paragraph to paragraph. These functions can be combined together.
Hence, there are also a few options we can take to implement the edit functionality:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single `EditAnnotationCommand` object to execute the entire edit functionality
** Pros: Easier to implement and also makes it clear as all related functionality are packaged in the same class.
** Cons: Does not abide by the Single Responsibility Principle. All checks will have to be performed in the same class.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a different subtype of `EditAnnotationCommand` to represent and execute each use case.
** Pros: Easier to extend. Also, less checks on conditions can be performed for each class implemented.
** Cons: Not straightforward to implement. The functions can overlap, which makes it difficult to segregate into separate responsibilities.

I decided to proceed with Alternative 1 as it is easier to implement. The overlaps in use cases of the `annotate-edit` command
makes it difficult to separate the responsibility. Hence the first alternative is more feasible to implement.

=== Folders feature

This section aims to explore the implementation of Mark's folders and some design considerations.

==== Implementation

The following two sections will explain in more detail how the backend and frontend of this feature works.

===== Model implementation of folders

A bookmark can be in a folder, and a folder can be nested within other folders for traditional directory organization.

This mechanism is facilitated mainly by `Folder` and `FolderStructure`.

`Folder` is simply another field in `Bookmark`, just like `Url` or `Name`, and has a single `String` property that contains the folder in which the bookmark is located.

`FolderStructure` represents the hierarchy of folders, containing the folder it represents and its subfolders

.Class Diagram of the Folders component
image::FolderStructureClassDiagram.png[]


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the folder structure behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The root `FolderStructure` will be initialized with the initial hierarchy in the stored data.

image::FolderStructureState0.png[]

Step 2. The user enters a `folder GER1000 p/Work` command to create a new `FolderStructure` in the subfolders of `work`. Starting from the `root`, a depth first search will be performed to locate `work`. When found, `ger1000` will be added to its subfolders.

image::FolderStructureState1.png[]

[NOTE]
If the parent folder is not provided, the parent folder will default to `root`.

The following sequence diagram shows in more detail how the execution of `folder GER1000 p/Work` works:

image::FolderSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddFolderCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Finally, the user sees his folder added successfully in the folder hierarchy.

===== UI implementation of the expand command

Mark displays the folders and their bookmarks in a JavaFX `TreeView`, and listens for any updates to the bookmarks
or the folder structure via `Observable` s so that the UI can also be updated accordingly.

As Mark is mainly a CLI-based application, the `expand` command is provided to allow users to "click" on all unexpanded folders.

As the underlying folder structure is not altered, `Oberservable` s cannot help us and so the command must send a signal to the UI that
an `expand` command needs to be performed.

Then, the following method is called to perform the expansion:

.Code snippet from `seedu.mark.ui.FolderStructureTreeView`
```java
 private void expand(TreeItem<String> node, int levels) {
    if (levels <= 0) {
        return;
    }
    if (node.isExpanded()) {
        node.getChildren().forEach(child -> expand(child, levels));
    } else {
        node.expandedProperty().set(true); // we expand it
        // make sure all children are not expanded
        node.getChildren().forEach(child -> child.setExpanded(false));
        expand(node, levels - 1);
    }
}
```

The method recursively expands a folder, and then recursively calls itself on all of that folder's subfolders until the desired level of expansion is achieved.

==== Design considerations

The following are a few design considerations made in deciding how to implement the folders feature:

===== Aspect: How the folder hierarchy is saved into storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves bookmark folder as its own field, and the hierarchy as a separate data structure.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Adding another field to a bookmark is simple, and storing the folder structure
on its own makes it more modular and easy to test as well.
** Cons: Easy for model to get into invalid state. For example, when renaming folders, the bookmarks containing the old folder names needs to be updated separately.
This leads to tight coupling and potential future maintenance issues.
* **Alternative 2:** Change the bookmarks from being stored in a list to being stored in a tree structure.
** Pros: Single source of truth, a bookmark's folder is simply which part of the tree it resides in. When a folder is renamed,
the bookmarks in that folder will still be in the same folder, so there is no extra step needed to update the bookmarks. This reduces coupling between the bookmarks and folders too.
** Cons: The whole `BookmarkList` abstraction will have to be rewritten. It is also significantly harder (in terms of ease of implementation) to filter, edit, and add bookmarks due to having to use
more advanced tree traversal algorithms as compared to naive list or array operations.

// end::folders[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder feature
==== Implementation
A bookmark can attach a reminder, and a reminder can be used to open the bookmark and send notifications to the user.
This mechanism is facilitated by `Reminder` and `ReminderAssociation`.

`Reminder` contains a reminding time, the `Url` of the `Bookmark` and a `Note`.

`ReminderAssociation` represents the association between `Reminder` and `Bookmark`, containing
 the relation from `Reminder` to `Bookmark` and `Reminder` to `Bookmark`.

.Class diagram of the Reminder component
image::ReminderAssociationDiagram.png[600, 400]

There are four parts of the reminder feature:

* Add a reminder to a specific bookmark (executed by `AddReminderCommand#execute()`)
* Edit a reminder (executed by `EditReminderCommand#execute()`)
* Delete a reminder (executed by `DeleteReminderCommand#execute()`)
* Goto the bookmark of a specific reminder (executed by `GotoReminderCommand#execute()`)

These command are triggered by `reminder` command line entered into the command box,
which will calls the respective command parser to create the command.
The bookmark of the reminder will be retrieved and handled according to the command.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the adding reminder operation works:

image::AddReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddReminderCommandParser` and `AddReminderCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

In the `reminder-delete` command, instead of calling `addReminder(bookmark, reminder)` in Model,
it will call `removeReminder(reminder)`.

In the `reminder-edit` command, instead of calling `addReminder(bookmark, reminder)` in Model,
EditReminderCommand will create a edited copy of the target reminder and call `editReminder(target, editedReminder)` in Model.

In the `reminder-goto` command, it will retrieved the bookmark of the reminder and generate a GotoCommandResult.
It works the same as `goto` command of the bookmark.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user attempts to use a reminder command:

image::ReminderActivityDiagram.png[600, 500]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to represent the relationship between reminder and bookmark
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use two hashmaps to store both the relationship from reminder to bookmark and bookmark to reminder.
** Pros: More OOP and can easily find the relationship.
** Cons: More complex when doing any operation to a reminder. Need to check two hashmaps.

* **Alternative 2:** Reminder is a field of bookmark.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
//TODO: Change this description
** Cons: Reminder is a field of bookmark, so using a reminder to open the bookmark violate the relationship.
// end::reminder[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
