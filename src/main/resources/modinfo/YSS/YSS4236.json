    "description": "The field of medical anthropology boasts a rich theoretical and empirical tradition, in which award-winning ethnographies have been written on topics ranging from local biology to structural violence. Guided by the key text, Medical Anthropology at the Intersections: Histories, Activisms, and Futures, this course will explore the canonical works of a number of leading medical anthropologists, including several whose research focuses on Asia (e.g., Das, Kleinman, Lock). Three key themes will be explored: 1) structural violence and social suffering; 2) technoscience and embodiment; and 3) medicine and humanitarianism.",
