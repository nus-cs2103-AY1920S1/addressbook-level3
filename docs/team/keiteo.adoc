== Introduction

This project portfolio highlights the contributions I have made for my project, _KeyboardFlashCards_ (KFC).
Done as a major part of our introductory software engineering module in the National University of Singapore,
we started off by morphing an address book application into our very own product,
a flashcard manager that is purely controlled using the Command-Line Interface (CLI). This is the key constraint of the
project, as users can only perform tasks by typing commands on the keyboard.
exclusively using the keyboard.

This is a 6-week software engineering project, where we worked in a team of 5 with other students from the NUS School of Computing.
Our team consists of 3 second year students majoring in Computer Science, including myself, and 2 Computer Engineering students in their final year of study.

Our finalised product, KFC, is an educational tool that aims to make remembering things easy, while at the
same time helping our users, computing students familiar with the CLI, to save time with simple and quick keyboard commands. We wanted
to provide an efficient way to study for our peers to NUS School of Computing. Hence, we came up with an easy to use,
flashcard manager using CLI for efficient and quick storage of important revision material to aid their study.

Here is a screenshot of our project:

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section is a summary of the contributions I have made to the team project. It includes code, documentation, and other types of helpful contributions._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: I designed and implemented *test mode*.
** What it does: Test mode allows users to test themselves using their flashcards. Individual flashcards will be shown in a series defined by the user;
the flashcard question will be displayed followed by its answer. This feature is a collection of
test commands to start test, display answer, rate flashcard, skip questions and finally end the test anytime.
** Justification: This feature is an integral part of the application as it allows users to test themselves by going through
the flashcards one by one. This way it helps users to better study the contents of the flashcards.
** Highlights: I implemented neat mini-feature that has a hidden flag to check whether the application is in test mode. This way, regular
commands such as `listall` and `add` commands will be blocked during test mode, and users are only allowed to input test commands.
In addition, I implemented an optional category field for the start test command for users to selectively
test flashcards from the their desired categories.
