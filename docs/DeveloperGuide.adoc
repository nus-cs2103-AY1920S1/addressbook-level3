=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram for a feature
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]


`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App covers the four features in _Modulo_ (Calendar, Cap, Quiz, Finance). All the features have the very similar structure, each consisting of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Rationale for having multiple `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` classes in _Modulo_

The features in _Modulo_ are quite distinct and having minimal overlaps, each feature has its own data file to read and modify. The logic to execute commands are also handled differently in each feature. As such, our decision to have 4 components for each feature was to reduce coupling and allow flexibility in our implementations. This means that the same `add` command is now able to trigger a different sequence of actions depending on the feature the user is currently in. This architecture style allows each feature to be developed independently, free from the constraints set by other features. Each time a user switches to another feature, the `Ui`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` classes will be replaced by that of the new feature.
// end::rationale[]

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete CS2103` when in the feature _Module_.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component for each feature
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/calendar/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (calendar)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/cap/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (cap)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/quiz/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (quiz)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/finance/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (finance)]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. Each feature in _Modulo_ (represented generically in the class diagram with `XYZ`) has their own UI component, largely with the same structure but mainly differing in classes `XYZPanel` and `XYZCard` to better present the information associated with the feature.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/calendar/Logic.java[`Logic.java` (calendar)],
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/cap/Logic.java[`Logic.java` (cap)],

The example below is in the context of the feature _Cap_ but all four  features in _Modulo_ have the same structure for their Logic components.

.  `Logic` uses the `CapLogParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call, in the context of another feature of the APP, _Calendar_.

NOTE: The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component for the feature Cap
image::CapModelClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Model Component for the feature Finance
image::FinanceModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/calendar/CalendarModel.java[`CalendarModel.java` (calendar)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cap/Model.java[`Model.java` (cap)],
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/quiz/Model.java[`Model.java` (quiz)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/finance/Model.java[`Model.java` (finance)]

Due to the different nature and behaviour of each feature in _Modulo_ dealing with different kinds of information (e.g. tasks, modules, quiz questions, finance logs etc), `Model` components between the feature can look very different. However, they do share some similar structures as mentioned below.

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the data for the feature (e.g. Calendar Data, Cap Module Log, Quiz book, Finance Log).
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<{Object used in Feature}>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component for the feature _Finance_
image::FinanceStorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/calendar/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (calendar)], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/cap/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (cap)], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/quiz/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (quiz)], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/finance/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (finance)]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the data used in each feature in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar

==== Calendar week change
===== Implementation
.Activity diagram on calendar week change
image::CalendarActivityDiagram.png[]
Calendar week change is done by removing all tasks from the calendar and adding all the tasks that either have the new
corresponding week number or is an instance of `ModuleTask`.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How `go WEEK_NUMBER` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save all data in a single json file.
** Pros: No need to switch storage file.
** Cons: Unnecessary reading of data from other weeks. Need to add filter to get only the relevant data.
* **Alternative 2:** Read and load for each week from separate json storage file.
** Pros: Easy to clear data from a certain week.
** Cons: Need to switch storage file each time the user go to the next/previous week.

==== Persistent `ModuleTask`
===== Implementation
.Structure of the Model Component for the feature Calendar
image::CalendarModelClassDiagram.png[]

The abstract class `Task` has two subclasses: `ToDoTask` and `ModuleTask`. `ToDoTask` only exists in its corresponding
week while `ModuleTask` is persistent. When a `ModuleTask` is added to any arbitrary week, it would be automatically
added to all of the other weeks and when a certain week is cleared using the `clearweek` command, it would not affect
the `ModuleTask`. Hence, `ModuleTask` can only be deleted by using the command `clear` or deleting each `ModuleTask`
manually using `delete`.

===== Design consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Create separate classes for `ToDoTask` and `ModuleTask` that both inherits from
the abstract class `Task`. User use different command `add` and `addmod` to create the corresponding subclass.
** Pros: Code looks cleaner. Easier to implement a different UI for each subclass.
** Cons: More code.
* **Alternative 2: ** Use a non-abstract class `Task` for both ToDos and Modules and add a boolean field `isPersistent`.
** Pros: No need to add new classes.
** Cons: User needs to input an extra field `<persist> [TRUE/FALSE]`. It is more difficult to differentiate the
type of `Task` when reading the code.

==== Sorting
===== Implementation

`Task` can be sorted according to `TaskTitle`, `TaskDeadline`, or `TaskTime`. Each type of sorting has its own
comparator implemented in a method that would return a sorted `FilteredList<Task>`.

===== Design consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): **Use an external comparator.
** Pros: Easy to switch between different sort type.
** Cons: Need to call the sort method each time the calendar is updated.
* **Alternative 2: **Set the `Task` class to implement the `Comparable` interface.
** Pros: Need to switch the `compareTo()` method of each `Task` each time `sort` is called.
** Cons: New/edited task would be automatically placed at the correct order.
// end::calendar[]

// tag::createquestion1[]
=== Quiz feature
==== Create question feature
===== Implementation

To use this feature, the user will need to switch to the quiz mode and add the question they want with
several requirements on the syntax stated in the UserGuide. Modulo quiz uses dark theme
because we don’t want users to strain their eyes from staring at their computer window too long.

Below are the quiz model class diagram:

image::ModelQuizClassDiagram.png[]

In quiz feature, a `Question` has 6 attributes namely: `Name`, `Answer`, `Category`, `Type`, `Comment`, `Tag`, with
the first three attributes differentiate one `Question` from the others. When the users first time launch the app or there are no data yet,
Modulo will automatically populate the four questions from `SampleDataUtil`. The users are able to use the `clear` command
if they want to delete the given data entirely. UI will then pull and updates the data from the `ModelQuizManager` which
represents the in-memory model of the `AddressQuizBook` data, and show them to the users.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how to add a question properly and the mechanism that behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application and switch to the *quiz* mode by executing `switch quiz`.

*Step 2.* The user executes `*add <qns>* _What is always coming, but never arrives?_ *<ans>* _Today_ *<cat>* _CS2131_ *<type>* _high_`
command to add a question with the question name: _What is always coming, but never arrives?_ and answer: _Tomorrow_, category: CS2131, type: _high_ in the quiz book.
The `add` command calls `Model#addQuestion()`, causing the modified state of the quiz book, after the command executes, to be saved in the `quizBookStateList` and shown in the UI.

*Step 3.* If the user realized that they have typed the wrong answer for a particular question, then the user can executes
`*edit 1 <ans>* _Tomorrow_` command to replace the previous answer with the new answer with the given index prepend behind. The `edit` command calls `Model#setQuestion()`,
causing the modified state of the quiz book, after the command executes, to be saved in the `quizBookStateList` and updated in the UI.

*Step 4.* _[Addtional]_ The user can execute `*comment 1 <val>* _The explanation is in pg 194 textbook_` if he/she now decide to add a comment or explanation of a quiz question at index 1.
The `comment` command calls `Model#setQuestion()` to parse in an additional parameter of comment into the entity of the question. It will then be saved in the
`quizBookStateList` and shown in the UI.
// end::createquestion1[]

[NOTE]
Users can also utilize the undo/redo command when they realize that they have execute a command that they shouldn't do (Will be explained in [3.4.2]).

// tag::createquestion2[]
The following activity diagram summarizes the basic question creation process:

image::QuizCreationActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How to add question

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users add question to the last of the list.
** Pros: Easy to implement and fast (Insertion O(1)).
** Cons: User may not be able to position the question from the list of questions.
* **Alternative 2:** Users insert the question to the desired position.
** Pros: User can order the list as they desired and remember things better.
** Cons: Not as fast as the insertion at the back of the list from alternative 1. +
{empty} +

// end::createquestion2[]
// tag::undoredo1[]
==== Undo/Redo feature
===== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedQuizBook`.
It extends `QuizBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `quizBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedQuizBook#commit()` -- Saves the current quiz book state in its history.
* `VersionedQuizBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous quiz book state from its history.
* `VersionedQuizBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone quiz book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitQuizBook()`, `Model#undoQuizBook()` and `Model#redoQuizBook()` respectively.

Below is an example usage scenario on how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1.* The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedQuizBook` will be initialized with the initial quiz book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single quiz book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

*Step 2.* The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th question in the quiz book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitQuizBook()`, causing the modified state of the quiz book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `quizBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted quiz book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

*Step 3.* The user executes `comment 1 <val> NewComment` to add a new question. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitQuizBook()`, causing another modified quiz book state to be saved into the `quizBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

// end::undoredo1[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitQuizBook()`, so the quiz book state will not be saved into the `quizBookStateList`.

// tag::undoredo2[]
*Step 4.* The user now decides that adding the question was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoQuizBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous quiz book state, and restores the quiz book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial quiz book state, then there are no previous quiz book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoQuizBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]
//end::undoredo2[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// tag::undoredo3[]
The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoQuizBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the quiz book to that state.
// end::undoredo3[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `quizBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest quiz book state, then there are no undone quiz book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoQuizBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

*Step 5.* The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the quiz book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitQuizBook()`, `Model#undoQuizBook()` or `Model#redoQuizBook()`. Thus, the `quizBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

*Step 6.* The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitQuizBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `quizBookStateList`, all quiz book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

// tag::undoredo4[]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire quiz book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the question being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

// end::undoredo4[]

====== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of quiz book states.
** Pros: Easy for new developers to understand.
** Cons: May suffer from performance issues on the memory (When a new command is executed, we must remember to update the list from `VersionedQuizBook`).
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::budget[]
=== Budgets in finances

==== Implementation

A budget is an estimate or threshold of spending set for a specified period of time. In _Modulo_, a budget can be set to only include spendings of a particular characteristic (i.e. transaction method, place of spending or category). For example, budgets of spendings at a particular place can be set. _Modulo_ will only take into account spendings recorded to be associated with this place and falling within the specified period of time.

To compute the current total amount spent so far and see whether this total amount still falls within the budget, amounts associated with entries are summed together.

These entries have to fulfill the following requirements set by the budget to be considered in the tabulation:

* Has to be a log entry of type `Spend`
* Transaction date has to fall within budget period (i.e. between the start and end dates)
* (If addition field of transaction method, place of spending or categorys specified) Has to either have the same transaction method, place of spending or be tagged with the same category

There are some classes in the `Model` component necessary for the computation of budgets:

* `Budget` - Contains the basic information about a budget (amount, start and end dates, additional characteristic `Spend` entry has to fall under (if any))
* `BudgetData` - The `Budget` object associated to it, the limit set by the budget and the current total amount tabulated from the `Spend` entries matching the budget requirements

In `ModelFinanceManager` which implements the `Model` interface, `Model#getFilteredBudgetDataList()` will return the list of `BudgetData` objects mapped from the list of `Budget` objects stored in the _Modulo_. These `BudgetData` are instantiated using information from the list of entries stored in _Modulo_. They filter out entries which do not match the requirements of the budget they are associated with, and then add up all the amounts of the entries to obtain the current total amount spent.

If the total amount of spending is close to exceeding the budget (more than or equals to 80% of budget spent), an orange label at the menu bar will be shown to notify the user that a budget is near to reaching its limit.

And if the total amount of spending has exceeding the limit set by the budget, the menu bar will have a red label indicating that the budget has been exceeded. The amount of money spend has gone over the estimate set and is now in deficit.

Given below is an example usage scenario for what happens when a budget is set, and how _Modulo_ behaves at each step.

This assumes that the user has not set any budget in the application before but has some entries recorded in the finance log. These entries are:

1. (Income) Amount: 800, Item: Internship Pay, From: ABCompany,  Transaction Method: Bank Transfer, Day:  7-11-2019
2. (Spend) Amount: 50, Item: EzLink TopUp, Transaction Method: NETS, Place: Caldecott MRT, Day:  4-11-2019
3. (Spend) Amount: 107.70, Item: Bicycle, Transaction Method: Cash, Day:  5-11-2019, Place: Toa Payoh Lor 4, Categories: bike
4. (Spend) Amount: 1.10, Item: KopiO, Transaction Method: Cash, Day:  2-11-2019, Categories: drink, kopitiam

*Step 1.* The user launches the application and switch to the *finance* mode by executing `switch finance`.

*Step 2.* The user wants to set a budget of 300 dollars for November for spendings done using cash. He executes the `budget <amt> 300 <month> 11-2019 <met> Cash` command to set this budget. The `budget` command calls `Model#addBudget(b)`, where upon the finance log will add `Budget` object `b` to `budgetList`, the list of budgets.

The interactions inside the Logic Component for `budget <amt> 300 <month> 11-2019 <met> cash` Command are shown in the sequence diagram below.

image::BudgetLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifelines for `BudgetCommandParser` and `BudgetCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reaches the end of diagram.

The interactions in the Model Component for the same command are shown in the sequence diagram below.

image::BudgetModelSequenceDiagram.png[]

The budget is added to the list of budgets (this being the first budget in the list). The list of budgets will update with the status of each budget.

Modulo will change the view after a `budget` command to show the list of budgets stored in Modulo.

[NOTE]
If the exact same budget already exists in the budget list, it will not call `Model#addBudget(b)`, and this budget will not be added to the list of budgets. Modulo will show an error message that this budget already exists.

*Step 3.* The user now decides to add another entry of spending. This time the user has recently spent 400 dollars on a Nintendo Switch and paid for it using cash. He enters this record with the `spend <amt> 400 <item> Nintendo Switch <met> Cash <day> 7-11-2019` command. This entry is added to the list of entries.

Since this entry is paid using cash, transaction date was in November 2019 it is included in the tabulation of the budget. It causes the total amount spent to exceed the budget of 300 dollars, and a red label in the menu bar appears to notify the user that a budget has exceeded.

*Step 4.* The user views the list of budgets (in this example, there is only one budget) using the `listb` command.

The window changes to a view of the budget, with information about its status shown.

These information include:

* Type of budget (for all `Spend` entries, for entries done using a specific transaction method, conducted at a specific place or tagged with a specific category)
* Start and end date of budget
* Progress bar of how much money has been spent (for entries fulfilling budget requirements)
* Whether the budget is active (current date falls between start and end dates) or not (end date of budget has passed or start date has yet to come)
* Total amount spend so far
* Limit set by budget
* Amount of money left to limit or how much has the budget been exceeded by

The flow on how what happens when the user enters a new entry is shown in the activity diagram below.

image::AddNewEntryActivityDiagram.png[width=60%]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support tabulation of spendings

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save just the basic details related to the budget - amount (limit to amount to be spent), start and end date, optional requirements `Spend` entries should fufill (transaction method, place of spending or category).
** Pros: Less information to store, flexible to changes such as updates to entries during edits (e.g. changes in amounts etc). Budgets can be retrospective (even if dates have past, budgets can still be set to see spending was kept within limits).
** Cons: Additional step of filtering to obtain entries matching budget requirements before tabulating the total amount - may have performance issues when number of entries is large in terms of time complexity.
* **Alternative 2:** Budget stores the same information as above, and also the list of entries that fulfill the budget requirements.
** Pros: Removes the need for filtering entries before tabulation, simply calculate total amount from list of entries stored under the budget.
** Cons: Will use more memory (now storing the list of entries). Difficult when an entry is delete or modified, have to delete and modify entry accordingly in the list of entries stored under the budget.

For the user to add new modules to the Modulo Grades Tracker, the `Module` has to be designed to satisfy the requirements of a module and the needs of the user.

* Each `Module` consists of `ModuleCode`, `Title`, `Semester`, `Credit`, `Grade`.
* All fields in `Module` are unique.
* Each class has their respective getter methods and validity-check method.

==== Implementation of Module commands

Module class supports multiple commands. They include:

* `AddCommand` - Adds a module to the Grades Tracker.
* `DeleteCommand` - Removes a module from the Grades Tracker by specifying the module code.
* `FindCommand` - Find and returns any modules with `ModuleCode` and/or `Title` that matches the keyword specified by the user.
* `SortCommand` - Sorts the modules in chronological order based on the `Semester` the module was taken.
* `ListCommand` - List all the modules. Often required after the find command.

[NOTE]
The lifelines for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reaches the end of diagram.

After a successful execution, the module with the specified module code will be deleted from Modulo Grades Tracker.

==== Design Consideration

All fields should not be have special characters or left blank as the details are important to the implementation and the user experience.

The class diagram below gives an overview of the Module class.


The search for the matching module code is implemented with a linear search. With 70 modules in Modulo, the linear search is still responsive and there were not observable lags.

*Alternative*

An alternative would be to use a search algorithm that comprises a Hash set and linear search.

.Considerations when designing the Module class
[width="80%" cols="^3, ^10" options="header"]
|=======
| Field | Validity
| ModuleCode | Module code should contain a set of 4 integers and no excessive characters. The student is provided with the liberty to input any module code in consideration that new modules and faculties may be created in the future.
| Semester | Semester should contain valid academic years and semester period. The academic year stated can only be +/-5 years than the current year, assuming that students are able to graduate in at most five years. While the semester period allows input from 1 to 4.
| Title | The title of the module is left for the user to define. This is to take into account that there might be new modules released in teh future hence the user needs to have the ability to customise the title. It is valid as long as it does not have special characters.
| Credit | As stated by NUS, the range of modular credit ranges from 2 to 23.
| Grade | Only NUS approved grades are allowed i.e. A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D+, D and F

== UI

The User Interface features a sleak and modern interface. The primary concept of the user interface includes simplicity, rounded corners, shadow-like back panes and trendy fonts. We have greatly enhanced the UI from the original addressbook. Borders are removed to ensure a smooth flow of content, delivering a "less is more" modern concept to enhance the user experience.

The quiz feature remains to have a dark theme as the dark theme doesn't harm the eyes of the user. It uses a more neutral tone to improve the productivity of the user.
