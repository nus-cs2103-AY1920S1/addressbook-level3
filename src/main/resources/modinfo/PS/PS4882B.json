    "description": "The seminar studies classic works by Angell, Mackinder, Carr, Schmitt, Morgenthau, Kennan, Churchill, Schelling, and other prominent writers on international affairs. It gives attention to thinkers beyond as well as within the academy and to the first half of the century as well as the second. By discussing these works in relation to a limited number of key themes, it invites students to engage with alternative understandings of international relations as perceived by twentieth-century thinkers.",
