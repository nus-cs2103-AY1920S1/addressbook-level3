    "description": "This course examines the contributions made by the humanities to the study of globalization. Globalization is most often conceived in economic or political terms; approaches which often fail to fully understand cultural norms, interaction, and exchange, or the shifting problems of meaning-making surrounding globalization. To address these issues, this module will take a dual approach. First, students will engage with texts that provide a set of concepts, theories, and methodological approaches distinct to or common in humanities disciplines. Second, students will interpret texts from a range of genres such as films, visual art, novels, television, music, philosophical texts, etc.",
