    "description": "This module provides an introduction to the psychological, social and behavioural factors that influence patterns of health and health care delivery across the lifespan. We take a transdisciplinary perspective, considering the role of \u201cmicro\u201d and \u201cmacro\u201d factors that influence the health of individuals and the public (e.g., from genes to the environment). We will explore determinants and consequences as well as identify effective interventions to prevent disease and promote health. This course emphasizes the use of empirical evidence from the psychological, social, behavioural and biomedical sciences as the basis of public health practice and policy.",
