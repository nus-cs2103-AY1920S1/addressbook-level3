    "description": "It is a 1-year module designed for MTD (Mechatronics) and MTD (Rapid Product Development) students and should be taken during their 1st year of MTD studies. An important component of this module is the project work where a team of 4-6 students work on the design and realization of a product. A team comprises MTD (Mechatronics) and MTD (Rapid Product Development) students. The learning objective is for students to be able to design new products in a teamwork-based and multidisciplinary environment. The learning outcome is student?s knowledge of the complete design process plus the prototype building stage with considerations for design for manufacturability. Topics covered include: Product Planning; identification of customer needs; product specification; mechatronics design approach and subsystems; modeling; applied electronics and interfacing; control fundamentals; concept generation and selection; product architecture; design for manufacturing; computer aided design; prototyping; intellectual property; design optimization and product economics; contemporary topics in design; and intellectual property. Activities include lectures, discussions, industrial design workshop, laboratory experiments, and project work. Module is 100 % Continuous assessment consisting of quizzes, assignments, and project work with teamwork.",
