    "description": "This module introduces students to the study of protest and contentious politics in Southeast Asia. The module will cover different theoretical approaches (behavioralism, Marxism, resource mobilization, political process, new social movements) as well as key analytical concepts (political opportunity structure, framing, social movement organizations, and transnational contention). Case studies, drawn from the late colonial and postcolonial periods, will examine individual social groups/sectors and major cycles of protest in the region (the Philippines in 1986 and 2001, Burma in 1988 and 2007, Indonesia and Malaysia in 1998, and Thailand in 1973, 1992, and 2006\u20108).",
