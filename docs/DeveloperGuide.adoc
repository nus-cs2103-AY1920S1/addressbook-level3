== Introduction

MooLah is a expense tracker, morphed from the seedu project "AddressBook - Level 3".

Expense tracking is an inherently troublesome task, because it includes managing
multiple budgets, monitoring complicated statistics, and anticipating future spending.
MooLah aims to streamline this process by providing a user-friendly desktop Command-Line Interface (CLI) solution.

MooLah improves user experience through autocomplete and prefix suggestions, significantly boosting efficiency.
MooLah also adopts an external library Natty, a natural language time parser, so that it accepts
more intuitive input format for time. MooLah's robust budgeting feature allows users to track expenses under different
budgets, monitor their spending through the progress bar, and receive timely notification when important thresholds are
reached. With MooLah's powerful statistics, users can view a summary of their spending in various modes, be
it a pie chart, a table or a trend line. Besides, users can plan ahead and set up reminders for future events.
Furthermore, the menu feature is specially tailored to students in National University of Singapore, allowing them to
record a food item expense directly from preset menus in school canteens. Almost all commands in MooLah support
undo-redo, increasing tolerance for occasional mistakes and thus creating a seamless user experience.
All these solid and well-developed features make MooLah a perfect personal financial assistant.

=== Purpose & Scope
This document specifies architecture and software design decisions for the app MooLah.
The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of MooLah.

=== Software Overview
MooLah is a desktop CLI application that help users track their expenses.
The App supports many other extensions such as budgeting, planning and reminders.
In particular, it is tailored to students in National University of Singapore who dine frequently in school canteens.

== Setting Up
This section contains information on steps to set up the developer environment on your computer.

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section explains MooLah's software architecture.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SinglePanelView`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


The content being shown in the `MainWindow` is managed by the ``SinglePanelView`` which supports the following operations:
``SinglePanelView#viewPanel(panelName)``
``SinglePanelView#hasPanel(panelName)``
``SinglePanelView#getPanel(panelName)``
``SinglePanelView#setPanel(panelName, panel)``

image::SinglePanelViewClassDiagram.png[]

Users may change between the visible panels through the CLI by using the `view` command.
The following sequence diagram shows the events which occur in order to change the the UI component displayed in the main window.

image::ViewPanelSequenceDiagram.png[]


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MooLahParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the MooLah data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `MooLah`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `MooLah` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the MooLah data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.moolah.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo functionality is facilitated by `ModelHistory` which is an instance-level member for models.
Internally, it stores model snapshots by using two stacks: `pastModels` and `futureModels`.
With the addition of model history, now `Model` also supports these operations:

* `Model#addToHistory()` -- Moves the history forward by saving the current model snapshot in its past history and clearing the future history.
* `Model#rollback()` -- Restores the state to the immediate previous model in the history.
* `Model#migrate()` -- Forwards the state to the immediate next model in the history.

`ModelHistory` only stores histories of models which were about to be (or are going to be) executed by model-changing commands.
As some of the commands available are intuitively not undoable (e.g. `help`), we make commands extend to either `UndoableCommand` or a non-undoable `Command` classes.
So, the `Model#addToHistory()` will only be called if the command to be executed is an instance of `UndoableCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The current `ModelHistory` is now empty.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 ...` command to add an expense.
The `add` command, being an `UndoableCommand`, calls `Model#addToHistory()`, which saves the state of the model just before the command executes to `pastModels`, and `futureModels` is cleared.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `delete 1` to delete the first expense on the list. The `delete` command, also an `UndoableCommand`, calls `Model#addToHistory()`, inserting another entry to the `pastModels` and clearing `futureModels` again.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addToHistory()`, so the model will not be saved into `ModelHistory`.

Step 4. The user now decides that deleting the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#rollbackModel()`, which will retrieve the immediate previous model in history, adding the current model to the future history of the retrieved model, and restores the model according to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If `pastModels` is empty, then there are no previous models to roll back. The `undo` command uses `Model#canRollback()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo command works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Inversely, the `redo` command calls `Model#migrate()`, which retrieves the immediate next model in history, adds the current model to the past history of the retrieved model, and resets the model according to that snapshot.

[NOTE]
If `futureModels` is empty, then there are no snapshots to be redone. The `redo` command uses `Model#canMigrate()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire model.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands have their own counter-command that can negate the effects.
** Pros: Quite intuitive (e.g. for `add`, just do `delete` to counter it).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

We choose Alternative 1 as this approach will be less likely to cause problems specific to restoring the state to the way it was before the execution of a command,
as some commands will create a problem specific on their own which might not be supported by the proposed counter-command.
As an example, to undo `delete 3`, we must re-add that expense to that specific position, which at the moment is not supported
by the `add` command.

// end::undoredo[]


// tag::budget[]
=== Budgeting Feature
The budgeting feature allows users to: (i) *add, delete and modify* budgets; (ii) monitor spending by the budget's
*progress bar* and *pop up notifications*; (iii) easily *modify or remove expenses* from the budget; (iv) *switch
period* to view past expenses; and (v) *switch the primary budget* to flexibly track expenses under different budgets.

==== Basics

Budgets form a *partition* of all expenses. That is, an `Expense` must belong to one and only one `Budget`,
and all expenses from all `Budget` must add up to the total number in the general expense list.
Each `Expense` keeps track of its own `Budget` through the `budgetName` attribute -- this is possible because
`UniqueBudgetList` disallows duplicate budget names. On the other hand, each `Budget` keeps track of a list of `Expense`
added to this budget, as shown in the figure below.

image::ExpenseAndBudgetRelationshipClassDiagram.png[width=33%]

//As shown in the figure below, each `Budget` has 5 attributes:
//
//. *description* (Description) : budget name;
//. *amount* (Price) : budget limit;
//. *window* (BudgetWindow) : the current budgeting period (see <<BudgetWindow and SwitchPeriodCommand>>)
//. *expenses* (ObservableList<Expense>) : the list of all expenses under this budget
//. *isPrimary* (boolean) : a flag indicating whether this budget is currently primary budget
//(see <<Primary Budget and SwitchBudgetCommand>>)
//
//image::BudgetClassDiagram.png[width=60%]

==== Add, Edit, Delete, Clear Budgets
There are five commands related to the addition, modification and removal of budgets, namely:
`AddBudgetCommand`, `EditBudgeCommand`, `DeleteBudgetByIndexCommand`, `DeleteBudgetByNameCommand`,
and `ClearBudgetsCommand`. +

Here is the class diagram of `AddBudgetCommand`:

image::AddBudgetCommandClassDiagram.png[width=60%]

As shown in the figure above, `AddBudgetCommand` has 2 methods:
(i) `validate(model)`, which checks whether the command is legal (i.e. will not result in duplicate budgets being added
 to MooLah), and throws `CommandException` to notify user of the illegal input if any;
(ii) `execute(model)`, which runs this command in model and successfully adds a new budget.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add budget` operation works:

image::AddBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddBudgetCommandParser` and `AddBudgetCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to
a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

As shown in the figure above, when user inputs "addbudget ...", `LogicManager` executes the `String`, and `MooLahParser`
creates the corresponding `CommandParser` which parses the input into an `AddBudgetCommand`. `AddBudgetCommand` then
validates itself by checking if there is an identical `Budget` already existing in `MooLah`. If no duplicate budgets are
found, it executes the command, adding the new `Budget` to `MooLah`. After that, `AddBudgetCommand` creates a `CommandResult`
and passes it back to `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` then saves the updated `MooLah` as Json file, and returns the
`CommandResult` to GUI to be displayed to user.

The implementation of other commands follows a similar flow as `AddBudgetCommand`, differing only in the parameters and corresponding
methods in ModelManager. A noteworthy implementation in `EditBudgetCommand` is that it has a inner class `EditBudgetDescriptor`
to record the updated attributes of the budget, which is then used in the method `EditBudgetCommand#createEditedBudget(Budget, EditBudgetDescriptor)`
to create an edited `Budget`, maintaining non-updated attributes the same as the original `Budget`.

When a `Budget` is edited, the original budget's expenses will be transferred to the updated budget through
`Budget#transferExpensesTo(Budget other)`. The transfer process does two things: (i) set the expenses's `budgetName`
to the new budget's name; (ii) add the expenses to the new budget's expense list. Similarly, when a `Budget` is deleted,
all its expenses will be transferred to `Default Budget` through the same method.

==== Primary Budget and SwitchBudgetCommand
At any time, there is one, and only one, *primary budget* in MooLah. All expenses added will go to this primary budget.
If the user wants to track expenses under a different budget, he switches to the target budget first, before adding the expense.
A newly created budget is automatically set to primary.
MooLah creates a `Default Budget` upon first launching. If no budget is created by the user, expenses will be tracked
under this `Default Budget`, which has a huge budget limit (`10^21`) and budgeting period (`100 years`).

The `SwitchBudgetCommand` takes in a budget name and switches primary budget to that budget.
Given below is an example usage scenario of SwitchBudgetCommand: +

*Step 1.* The user launches MooLah for the first time. The default budget will be created and set as the primary budget.

image::PrimaryBudget1.png[width=40%]

*Step 2.* The user adds an expense "bubble tea". Since the default budget is the primary one, this expense will go
under default budget.

image::PrimaryBudget2.png[width=40%]

*Step 3.* The user creates a budget "School". Since "School" is newly added, it will be set as the primary budget.

image::PrimaryBudget3.png[width=40%]

*Step 4.* The user adds an expense "chicken rice". Since "School" is the primary budget, this expense will go
under "School".

image::PrimaryBudget4.png[width=40%]

*Step 5.* The user now wants to add another expense "movie", but does not want it tracked under "School". As such, the
user executes `switchbudget d/default budget`. The default budget is now the primary budget.

image::PrimaryBudget5.png[width=40%]

*Step 6.* The user adds the expense "movie", which is tracked under the current primary budget - default budget.

image::PrimaryBudget6.png[width=40%]

==== BudgetWindow and SwitchPeriodCommand

A budget is like a *sliding window* that moves along the time axis. The window has a fixed size determined by
`BudgetPeriod`, an enum class with five values: `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `INFINITY` (for Default Budget).
Only expenses within the *current window* are shown in the app. Every time the budget refreshes, the window "slides"
to the next period, starting with an empty screen that gradually gets populated with newly added expenses over time.
This is achieved through the `BudgetWindow` class.

Here is the class diagram of `BudgetWindow`:

image::BudgetWindowClassDiagram.png[width=33%]

As shown in the figure above, `BudgetWindow` has 3 attributes: start date, end date, and period. The start and end
dates are modifiable, but the period is fixed. This corresponds to the above-mentioned "sliding window" concept.

A budget keeps a list of all expenses ever been tracked by this budget, including historical ones. Additionally,
it has a method `Budget#getCurrentPeriodExpenses()` that filters from this list expenses within the current
budgeting period, which in turn get to be shown on MooLah's GUI.

When users want to view expenses in a past period, they can do so by executing `SwitchPeriodCommand`. This command
takes in a `Timestamp` and switches the budget window to a period anchored by that `Timestamp`. This is achieved by
`BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `SwitchPeriodCommand`: +

*Step 1.* The user has a monthly budget "school" that recurs on the 5th of each month. Suppose the current date is
`10 Nov`. As a result, the current budgeting period will be `5 Nov - 4 Dec`.

*Step 2.* The user wants to view expenses in September. As such, the user executes `switchperiod t/20-09`
(`20-09` is interchangeable with any other dates within `5 Sep - 4 Oct`). This command calls
`BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)`, which shifts the window's start and end dates to `5 Sep` and `4 Oct` respectively,
while maintaining the fixed period -- `MONTH`. As a result, the user sees expenses tracked under the budget during `5 Sep - 4 Oct`.

The `BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)` method is also called upon adding a new `Budget` to MooLah. No matter how
far the start date inputted by the user is from now, it will be normalized to the current period, such that expenses added
subsequently will correctly be reflected in the budget panel.

Each budget, once added, will recur infinitely. This is achieved by `Budget#refresh()`, along the `Timekeeper` class.
Every 10 seconds, `Timekeeper` checks if it is a new day, and call `Budget#refresh()` if necessary. Subsequently,
`BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)` is called; the anchor passed in is current time. As a result, the `Budget` is
successfully normalized to the current period.

//==== Add, Edit, Delete Expense from a Budget
//Addition of expenses are executed through AddExpenseCommand. Since it does not take in any INDEX parameters,
//the execution can be done irrespective of the currently shown list, and the change will always be correctly reflected
//in the budget panel.
//The case is different for editing and deleting expenses, which takes in an INDEX dependent on the currently shown list.
//As such, editing from the general expense list is different from editing from a budget's expense list. This is why two
//separate commands, EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand and DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand, are implemented, apart from
//EditExpenseCommand and DeleteExpenseCommand which work on the general expense list.
//
//EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand and DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand obtain their target expense (to be edited/deleted)
//through `model.getPrimaryBudget().getCurrentPeriodExpenses()` in the two commands' validate() and execute() method.
//This makes sure the INDEX is based on the primary budget's currently shown expense list, which includes all expenses
//within the current budgeting period.

//==== List budgets
//ListBudgetsCommand shows a list of all budgets stored in MooLah. The command returns a CommandResult with view
//request to "BudgetListPanel.PANEL_NAME". Subsequently, MainWindow#changePanel(PanelName) will switch the currently
//shown panel to BudgetListPanel.
//ListBudgetsCommand has the same effect as "view budget list".

==== UI Component of Budget
There are three classes related to the UI display of budgets:
(i) `BudgetCard`, which shows the budget name, period, and progress bar -- GUI representation of a `Budget`
(ii) `BudgetListPanel`, which displays a list of `BudgetCard` -- called through `ListBudgetsCommand` or `view budget list`
(iii) `BudgetPanel`, which displays a `BudgetCard` at the top, and a list of current period expenses below -- called through `view primary budget`

The progress bar in `BudgetCard` shows the proportion used against the budget limit. This is calculated by
`Budget#calculateProportionUsed()`, which divides the *sum of all current period expenses* against the *budget limit*,
returning a `Percentage` that wraps the result (rounded to the nearest integer).

Besides, the budget also gives popup notification when proportion used reaches *50%*, *90%*, and *100%*. These 3 status
correspond to `Budget#isHalf()`, `Budget#isNear()` and `Budget#isExceeded()`. Before each command in MooLah is executed, the
initial values of these 3 booleans are recorded by `LogicManager#recordInitialPrimaryBudgetStatus()`, which returns a
boolean array of size 3. At the end of each command, the final values of these 3 booleans are recorded again by
`LogicManager#recordFinalPrimaryBudgetStatus()`. The two arrays are then passed into `MainWindow#showWarningIfAny()`
for a comparision, and if any values have changed, `MainWindow#showPopupMessage()` will show the corresponding pop up
notification to remind the user of the budget progress.
//diagram
//image::PercentageClassDiagram.png[]

==== Storage of Budgets
Budget objects are stored in Json format, through the `JsonAdaptedBudget` class. The Json file has the same properties
as the budget, except: (i) it flattens the `BudgetWindow` field into start date, end date and period, for clearer display;
(ii) it stores a list of `UniqueIdentifier` to expenses, instead of a list of `JsonAdaptedExpense`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens to budgets when the app launches and when a new expense is added:

image::BudgetActivityDiagram.png[width=50%]

==== Integration with Undo-Redo
Budgeting-related commands integrate well with Undo-Redo feature, by extending `UndoableCommand`. Undoable commands are
those modifying data in MooLah, for example, `AddBudgetCommand` and `EditBudgetCommand`. On the other hand, commands that
only result in GUI changes, such as `ListBudgetsCommand`, is not undoable.

A difficulty here is to make every "undo" immediately reflected on GUI. Since undo rollback on models, this dictates that
every change must result in a new budget object being created and replacing the old one. Otherwise, even though the
change is reflected backend, it will not show in frontend because the Budgets in two models are still referring to
the same object. This task is handled by `Budget#deepCopy()`, which is widely called from `UniqueBudgetList`, in every method
that modifies the existing budgets.

//table for all undoable commands

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Since `Budget` already keeps a list of `Expense`, should `Expense` have a `Budget` field?

* **Alternative 1:** `Expense` has a `Budget` field
** Pros: Easier to manage expenses.
** Cons: Causes cyclical dependency, and reduces testability. Also, this will cause infinite loop when creating
`JsonAdaptedExpense` and `JsonAdaptedBudget`.

* **Alternative 2:** `Expense` does not have any reference to `Budget`
** Pros: Less coupling.
** Cons: When reconstructing MooLah from Json file, system does not know which budget to add the past expenses to.

* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Each `Expense` keeps a `budgetName` field which indicates the name of the `Budget` it is tracked under. Since `UniqueBudgetList`
disallows duplicate budget names, a name is sufficient to identify a `Budget`. Besides, since `budgetName` is of
`Description` type instead of `Budget` type, it is easy to convert to `String`, and resolves the problem of infinite loop
when creating Json files. Also, the resulting `JsonAdaptedExpense` file will not be too long, since the `budgetName` property
stores only the budget name instead of the full `Budget` object.

===== Aspect: Can one `Expense` be tracked under multiple `Budget`? Or under no `Budget` at all?

* **Alternative 1:** Every `Expense` must be tracked under one, and only one `Budget`.
** Pros: Budgets would be a partition of all expenses, which makes generating statistics (pie charts, etc.) easier.
** Cons: Reduces flexibility in tracking expenses - users would not be able to track expenses that fall under multiple
budgets.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow `Expense` with multiple `Budget`, or without any `Budget`.
** Pros: Users would enjoy more flexible budgeting experience.
** Cons: This might result in duplicate calculation of expenses and difficulty in generating pie charts, as statistics
revolves around budgets.

* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Adopt Alternative 1. Every Expense must be tracked under one and only one budget. If the expense is added before
adding any budgets, a default budget with a huge limit and infinite period is created for tracking all expenses without
a proper user-defined budget. This ensures that the main screen has a budget and shows a budget status bar at all times.
Besides, it leads to neater statistics.

===== Aspect: How should JsonAdaptedBudget keep track of the budget's expenses?

* **Alternative 1:** JsonAdaptedBudget stores a list of JsonAdaptedExpenses
** Pros: More intuitive, improving readability of json file. Also eases reconstruction of MooLah from storage file,
since JsonAdaptedExpenses can be easily converted to model type Expenses.
** Cons: Json file is subject to user modification. If expenses are modified such that those in general expense list
differ from their counterparts in budget's expense list, this will cause data inconsistency and introduce bugs into
MooLah.

* **Alternative 2:** JsonAdaptedBudget stores a list of UniqueIdentifiers
** Pros: Guards against accidental user modification of json file.
** Cons: More hassle when reconstructing MooLah from storage, since the JsonAdaptedBudget#toModelType() will need to
refer to MooLah's expense list, identify those expenses by their UniqueIdentifiers, and add them to the budget.

* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Adopt Alternative 2. Since every expense has a unique identifier, a list of UniqueIdentifiers, supplemented with a list
of MooLah's general expenses, is sufficient to correctly reconstruct those expenses tracked under this budget. The
benefit of protecting MooLah from external json modification outweighs the extra hassle in reconstructing MooLah from
storage.

// end::budget[]

// tag::events[]

=== Events feature
==== Implementation

The Events feature allows users to add events that are supposed to occur on a future date. On launch, MooLah will
remind users of upcoming events. MooLah will also notify the user about any events that are supposed to have
transpired, and allow them to automatically add these events as expenses.

The Events feature supports the `add`, `delete` and `events` command words.

Events are added the same way expenses are added on the command line. When the user inputs an add command,
MooLah determines whether an event or an expense should be added based on the date the user inputted in his command.
This is illustrated below:

image::AddExpenseOrEventActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how MooLah handles transpired events on launch:

image::TranspiredEventsSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. When MooLah launches, the `start` method of `UiManager` is called. `UiManager` then calls the `handleTranspiredEvents`
of `MainWindow`, which fetches all transpired events and notifies the user about them. It does so by first obtaining the
transpired events from the `Timekeeper` class by calling a series of getter methods.

2. Once the transpired events have been obtained, for each transpired event, a new `TranspiredEventWindow` will be
constructed. The transpired event will then be passed via `show`, a method of the newly constructed `TranspiredEventWindow`.
`show` will create a popup window that details the transpired event, and asks the user whether it should be added as an
expense. This popup window will have a 'Yes' and 'No' button.

3. If the user presses the 'Yes' button, the original command that the user inputted to add this particular event is fetched
and passed to the `execute` method of `LogicManager`, which executes command line inputs. Since the timestamp within this
original command now denotes a past or present date, an expense will be added.

4. If the user presses the 'No' button, the expense is not added.

5. After pressing either button, the popup window closes.

NOTE: As of Week 10, adding expenses to the same budget the event was added to is still a work in progress.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What command words should the Events feature use?

* ** Alternative 1:** `addevent`, `deleteevent`, etc.
** Pros: Makes it clear to the user that events are separate from expenses
** Cons: Somewhat clunky and redundant, especially since expenses and events share the same fields

* ** Alternative 2:** `add`, `delete`, etc. (i.e. same command words as adding expenses)
** Pros: More streamlined, makes use of the fact that expenses and events share the same fields
** Cons: The distinction between events and expenses is more blurry to the user

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
Adopt Alternative 2. Since an event is ultimately an optional future expense that triggers on its
due date, it is significantly more intuitive and natural to allow users to add events the same way they add expenses.
MooLah can then easily tell whether the user intends to add an expense or an event by looking at the timestamp
the user inputs in the command.


===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)

Users can set their expenses to recur. Recurring expenses will generate events daily/weekly/monthly (based on
the user's decision) that can then be added as expenses when their due dates are reached.

// end::events[]

// tag::statsdg[]
=== Statistics Feature

The statistics feature allows users to have an alternative view for the entries in `MooLah`.
It is facilitated by the `Statistics` interface, which is part of the `model` package, and is implemented by 3 classes
`PieChartStatistics`, `TabularStatistics` and `TrendStatistics`. Each of the implementing classes will be invoked when
their respective parsers detect its corresponding command word, which is `statsbasic`, `statscompare` and `statstrend`.
The prefix configurations vary greatly between them as well as the visual representation they create.

Given below is a class diagram to summarise the relationship between `Statistics` and its implementing classes.


image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]


The main entries that `Statistics` interacts with are `Expense` class and the `Budget` class. The entire statistics features only
supports the generating of statistics from only the current budget and responds to the different methods called by
the current `Budget` object. Every successful interaction will force a switch to the `Statistics Panel`, where each of
their different visual representations will be generated.

The following activity diagram summarizes how statistics are shown from a current budget after possible user inputs
to modify the attributes of the budget.


image::BasicStatisticsCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

In the following sections, the implementation details of one of the more complicated command words will be discussed,
as well as its design considerations.


==== `statsbasic`

===== Implementation

The purpose of the `statsbasic` command word is to request `MooLah` to visualise the total expenditure across
expenses of different categories as a percentage of the total expenditure of all expenses tracked under the budget
where the command is called. The visual representation used here will be a PieChart.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `statsbasic` command word is handled by `MooLah`.



Step 1. The user enters the command `statsbasic sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019` to visualise the total percentage of each category
as a percentage of total expenditure across all categories, in the primary budget.
The command is received by `MooLahParser`, which then creates a `StatsCommandParser` object,
to subsequently help to parse the input by the user.

Step 2. The newly created `StatsCommandParser` calls `parse("stats sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019")`,
which in turns calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize("sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019", PREFIX_START_DATE, PREFIX_END_DATE)` to
split the arguments into its preamble(the start date and end date). This returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object, `argMultimap` containing the split input.


Step 3. The `StatsCommandParser` object creates a `StatsDescriptor` object `desc` to hold the start date and end date that was specified by the user.
Depending on the presence of start date and end date, `desc` will be filled in differently.

If the start date and end date is both specified by the user, the start date will be checked to be before the end date.
If the end date happens to be before the start date, a `ParseException` will be thrown

Step 4. The filled `desc` will be returned to the `LogicManager` where a new `StatsCommand` command, `statsCommand` will be created with `desc`

Figure 1. below illustrates the details from Steps 2 to 4.

image::BasicStatisticsParserToCommand.png[]

Figure 1. Reference Diagram for creating a `StatsCommand`


Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls `StatsCommand#run()`, where the `StatsCommand` will be validated before getting executed.

Step 5. During execution, `StatsCommand` calls `ModelManager#getPrimaryBudget()` to retrieve the primary budget to calculate statistics from.
After which, `StatsCommand` will call `createPieChartStatistics', which takes in `desc` and the primary budget.

Step 6. To construct the time interval required for statistics, information from `desc` is being processed.
If there are unspecified inputs inside `desc`, the time interval will be constructed with some information from the primary budget.

Step 7. The `PieChartStatistics` object will be created with the constructed interval as well as the expenses the primary budget tracks.
After which, `StatsCommand` will call `PieChartStatistics` implementation of `populateData()` to fill up its other fields

Step 8. `StatsCommand` calls `ModelManager#setStatistics(statistics)` which updates the `Statistics` attribute in `ModelManager`.

Step 9. A `CommandResult` is then created and returned to `LogicManager`, which will then force a switch
to the `Statistics Panel` where a Pie Chart will be generated.


Figure 2. below illustrates the details from Steps 6 to 9.

image::CreatePieChartReference.png[]

Figure 2. Reference Diagram for creating a `StatsCommand`


The following sequence diagram shows how the `statsbasic` operation works as a big picture:

image::BasicStatisticsCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Figure 3. Sequence Diagram for executing a `StatsCommand`



==== Design Considerations

When designing the interaction of the command word `statsbasic`, decisions have to be made on the most
suitable visual representation for `statsbasic` particular use case.

* ** Alternative 1:** Table view
** Pros: Sequential view, can capture number of entries
** Cons: May be a duplicate of the `ListExpense` command, just sorted via categories

* ** Alternative 2:** Pie chart
** Pros: Offers a visual view of size to represent the expenditure under each category
** Cons: Loses the elements of number of entries in each category

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
Adopts Alternative 2. It is important that every aspect of the user experience gets covered, and what `MooLah` before the
inclusion of `Statistics` is the appreciation of percentage expenditure in each category of expenses. Expenses can already be
observed in its chronological order using `ListExpense` while individual view of expenses under a category can be accessed
using `FindExpense`. Offering a visual view on expenditure under each category complements with the existing implementation
of sequential view in the primary budget.

NOTE: Once again, this question will be better addressed holistically once all 3 features has been rolled out.

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)

For each of the command words, users will be given the option to choose a Visual Representation method they prefer
if the use case allows for it, instead of the default option we have prioritised.
Currently, statistics under `statsbasic` mode can only be displayed in a pie chart,
and users may have different preferences for formats. The current implementation for MooLah
is such that only expenses up to the current date will be included and any expenses after the current date
is considered an event, which is not tracked by statistics. The inclusion of events in statistics
can be a possible complementary feature to a prediction feature to pre-empt users about their incoming expenses.
Last of all, more modes can be added to all existing commands, such as comparing with periods across different budgets
other than being restricted within the same budget



// end::statsdg[]


// category::Alias[]
=== Alias feature
==== Implementation
The Aliases feature allows users to assign inputs they may use very often to a shortcut, and execute the input by entering
the shortcut, (a.k.a ``Alias``), in place of the full or partial command.

image::AliasMappingsClassDiagram.png[AliasMappingsClassDiagram]

These user defined ``Alias``es are saved in an ``AliasMappings`` object within ``UserPref`` as seen in the above diagram.
Internally, the ``AliasMappings`` object stores an ``Alias`` in a Map<Strings, Alias> object. With the addition of `AliasMappings` object to ``UserPref``,
``UserPref`` supports these additional operations:

- ``UserPref#addUserAlias(Alias)`` -- Saves a specified `Alias` to the user preferences for future use.
- ``UserPref#hasAlias(String)`` -- Query if the there is an `Alias` with this name already defined.
- ``UserPref#getAlias(String)`` -- To get an `Alias` with this name if it exists.
- ``UserPref#aliasNameIsReservedCommandWord(Alias)`` -- To query if this `Alias` is uses a name which clashes with existing built-in
commands.
- ``UserPref#aliasCommandWordIsAlias(Alias)`` -- To query if this `Alias` `input` begins with another `Alias`, this is used
to validate that an `Alias` will not cause an infinite loop by chaining multiple aliases in a loop.
- ``UserPref#getAliasMappings()`` -- To access the ``Alias`` saved by the user.
- ``UserPref#setAliasMappings(AliasMappings mappings)`` -- To overwrite all the `Alias` saved by the user.


image::AliasCommandClassDiagram.png[]

In order for the user to save an ``Alias``, they first define it using the ``AliasCommand``. The ``AliasCommand`` command extends
`UndoableCommand` to allow users to undo defining an `Alias`. The following sequence diagram describe in more detail how an ``Alias``
is added.

image::HighLevelAddAliasSequenceDiagram.png[]
[None]
. 1. The user enters a command with the following syntax `` alias a/ <name> i/ <input>``.
. 2. The `UI` passes this command string to the `LogicManager` which passes it onto the `MooLahParser`.
. 3. The parser extracts the argument string and passes it to an ``AliasCommandParser``.

image::ParseAliasCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
[None]
. 4. The ``AliasCommandParser`` uses the ``ArgumentTokenizer`` to tokenize the argument string and extract the
``alias name`` and ``input`` fields into an ``ArgumentMultimap``.
. 5. The arguments are obtained and to create a new `Alias` using the the `Alias` parser in `ParserUtil`.
. 6. An `AliasCommand` is created containing this new `Alias` to add to the `UserPref`.
. 7. This is passed back to the `LogicManager` to call `AliasCommand#run()`.

image::verifyAlias.png[]
[None]
. 8. The `AliasCommand` is validated using `AliasCommand#validate()`. The `Alias` is checked to ensure it does not
[None]
    ** a. Have a clashing name used by an existing `Command` as a CommandWord.
    ** b. Have an input beginning with a supported `Alias`.
. If is not valid, handled exception is thrown.

image::addAlias.png[]
[None]
. 9. If it was validated that the `Alias` can be added.
. 10. The `Alias` is then added to the `AliasMappings` object within `UserPref`.
. 11. The `Alias` is now usable  by the user.


When a user enters an ``input`` to be executed, the ``MooLahParser`` will first try to parse first token in
the ``input`` as a ``CommandWord``, failing which, it will try to parse it as an ``Alias``. If it successfully does so,
it replaces the first token in the original command string with the ``input`` stored in the ``Alias``.
Finally, the ``MooLahParser`` re-parses the modified ``input``.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Why can an `Alias` only be used at the beginning of an input versus anywhere within an input.
* ** Alternative 1(Chosen):** Beginning only
** Pros: Easier to determine which word is the shortcut.
** Pros: Easier to detect recursion due to alias chaining.
** Cons: Less flexible in term how the shortcut can be used i.e. it can only replace or prefix an input.

* ** Alternative 2:** Anywhere in input
** Pros: A wider variety of shortcuts can be defined by the user +
e.g. `add deckChicken 2.50`, where `deckChicken` maps to `d/ chicken rice c/ food p/`.
** Cons: Harder to detect recursion due to alias chaining.
** Cons: Parsing becomes more complicated and alias words become unusable in other contexts.
e.g. defining an `Alias` mapping `bus` to `sbs bus` prevents an input such as `smrt bus` from being parsed properly
as it would be replaced with `smrt sbs bus` by the parser.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
The biggest factor in choosing `Alternative 1` is to make it easier to prevent possible recusion due to alias chaining,
which would potentially be a fatal bug in the application.
Additionally, while it may be possible to determine which one the user means judging by the context in which it was used.
However, that is far out of the scope of the module and would require much more processing of user input.

Another alternative would have been to have an alias name follow the following convention `'aliasName'` (i.e. some character before and after)
clear what is an `Alias` within an input.

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)
The purpose behind this feature was to make CLI input less troublesome, so users do not need to type in the full input string
to carry out commands they may use frequently. In v2.0 we want to look into using data analysis track users' input habits in
order to make suggestions on possible shortcuts or Aliases they may find convenient to have.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store Aliases.

* ** Alternative 1:** List
** Pros: Less space needed to store same amount of data
** Cons: Takes time to loop through the list to get the right output.

* ** Alternative 2(Chosen):** Map
** Pros: Simple to access
** Cons: More space needed.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
As the user can define multiple aliases, it was important for the internal structure of `AliasMappings`
to allow accessing the aliases by name.

If an ArrayList was used, the numbering each alias would change if new ones were added and old one removed or replaced.
Map was used to prevent this problem as the name is used as the index. This avoids the need to loop through
all the 'Alias' defined.

It also makes it easier to prevent sharing of alias names between aliases and a Map's key
set cannot contain duplicates, and makes it easier to handle overwriting of existing aliases with same name.


// end::Alias[]


// category::SyntaxAutofill[]
=== Syntax Highlighting and Autofill feature
==== Implementation
The Autofill feature was implemented to make it less important for users to remember the appropriate syntax for each command which
can be a common issue in CLI based applications. This feature utilises regular expressions and JavaFX's TextFormatter to extend the
functionality of the existing TextField used in the original AB3 application.

The Autofill feature also inserts `placeholders` into the text area to make it clearer which arguments each prefix delimit in the input.
e.g. `add d/ <description> p/ <price> c/ <category>`. These `placeholder` are removed when the user types over them and
are filtered from the input and not parsed by the `Parser` if the user forgets to type over them. The following diagram briefly describe
the logic used to insert auto fill a command's syntax.

::image:AutoFillActivityDiagram.png[]

The Syntax highlighting feature was implemented to make it easier to differentiate the different arguments after typing
as well as to implement some basic realtime input validation. This feature utilises RichTextFX's StyleClassTextArea to
apply different styles to different regions of the text, and regular expressions to determine which to highlight.

::image:SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram.png[]

Because RichTextFX's TextAreas do not support JavaFX's TextFormatter, the `SyntaxHighlightingTextArea` actually has two different
TextAreas. One as the visible TestArea (RichTextFX) and one as the functional one (JavaFX).

::image:SyntaxHighlightingTextAreaClassDiagram.png[]

The two TextArea are layered on top of each other. The invisible functional TextArea overlays the visible one, and mirrors the TextProperty of the
visible one mirrors the functional TextArea. The KeyEvents which occur in the functional text area are also mirrored by the visible text area.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Which configuration of Input fields to use? - RichTextFX TextArea alone, JavaFX alone, both together?
* ** Alternative 1:**  JavaFX alone (JavaFX `TextField`) and manually place coloured elements to handle highlighting.
** Pros: Already supports single line input.
** Pros: Easy to implement autofill.
** Cons: Does not inherently support styling of text with multiple styles.
** Cons: Manually inserting worked, but not all the time.

* ** Alternative 2:** `RichTextFX StyleClassTextArea` and ``Listener``s to handle formatting of text.
** Pros: Supports styling of text.
** Cons: Needs have certain `Events` blocked and functionality removed in order to act as a single line input field. e.g.
preventing users from pasting text with newlines and the enter key event from making a new line.
** Cons: Does not support javafx `TextFormatter`, intermediate results (unwanted text) can possibly be evaluated.

* ** Alternative 3(Chosen):** Both
** Pros: Utilise best of both worlds, with `TextFormatter` and `RichTextFX StyleClassTextArea`
** Cons: Need to properly align the two text areas so visible text and caret position is accurate.
** Cons: Needs have certain `Events` blocked and functionality removed in order to act as a single line input field. e.g.
preventing users from pasting text with newlines and the enter key event from making a new line.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
With alternative 1, using a `TextFlow` was a problem when the text needed to remain in
a single line. Manually layering coloured elements over the text was also an issue as the the position and size of elements
eeded to be recalculated every time the text change, the UI moved, or was resized.

While it was possible to use RichTextFX text areas alone, the text that the user inputs before it is formatted
still enters the text area. Which interferes with realtime parsing as the text is not properly sanitized, which was
why the uses `TextFormatter` was necessary.

This meant only alternative 3 was viable, but because of layer of the two text areas, the events causing a change in text
or what text was visible needed to be properly mirrored from the invisible to the visible text area. As a result, certain behaviours
supported by a normal textfield needed to be blocked to ensure proper alignment e.g. copy and paste.

At the moment, mass deletion and selection of text (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+A > Backspace) has been prevented in order to properly align the
two textarea.

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)
MooLah v2.0 should support better real time parsing of input and support validation of input without requiring the user
to enter the command as well as a more functional input field.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
