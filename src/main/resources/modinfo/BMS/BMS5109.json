    "description": "In industry, actual results often deviate from estimates. While there are courses that attempt to address this issue by focusing on strategic frameworks, or even on control and implementation systems, none have used a perspective-oriented approach to bridge the planningimplementation divide. Industry players like BCG, have identified these issues and published a book titled:'Your strategy needs a strategy'. This course utilizes propriety approaches that are perspective oriented. The focus is on building process capabilities by using an experiential learning approach.",
