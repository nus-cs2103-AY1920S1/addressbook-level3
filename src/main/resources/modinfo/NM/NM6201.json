    "description": "How should we understand the relationships among media and the social and cultural contexts in which they operate? How should we think through the relationship of technology, culture and communication? How do certain cultures create and naturalise particular modes of media form and content? How do media technologies interact with/create forms of community and identity? This module addresses these concerns by introducing students to cultural approaches to communication. It examines debates on culture in the field of communication studies, and approaches the study of communication as culture.",
