    "description": "This course invites students to to consider the extent to which contract law both mirrors and shapes a liberal society's conception of liberty, equality and community. We will valuate some different theoretical accounts for the main features of the common law of contract; engage with the difficulties behind some apparently simple anchors such as 'freedom of contract', 'the intention of the parties', 'vitiation of consent' and 'expectation interest'; to consider the appropriate role of the state through its laws in shaping contractual practices and outcomes.",
