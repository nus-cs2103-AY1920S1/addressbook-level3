    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for the BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, wind and percussion. Normally undertaken in the third year of study, this module usually follows the completion of the Junior Recital; the first of two capstone modules in relation to the Major. In following on from a Junior Recital, the module is largely about beginning the process of evolution from undergraduate study either towards graduate entry or professional life.",
