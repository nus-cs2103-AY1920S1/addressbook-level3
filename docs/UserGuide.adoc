== Introduction

Weme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, Weme is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Weme can let you manage memes faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `weme.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Weme.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`tab memes`* : switches to the meme tab
* In the meme tab:
** *`list`* : lists all memes
** **`add`**`p/~/Downloads/meme.jpg d/Top meme` : adds a meme located at "~/Downloads/meme.jpg" with the description "Top meme"
** **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd meme shown in the meme tab
** *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
