    "description": "A predominant pattern in Western epics has been the \u201dNovel of Formation\u201d\n(Bildungsroman) \u2013 the novel that follows an individual through the stages of\nher life. The last century has seen a radical reversal. Instead of narrating a\nlife\u2019s development, the new novel concentrates on the institution that\nshapes individuals and renders them subjects (school, bureaucracy, court of\nlaw etc.). The German\u2010Czech writer Kafka is the master of the new genre. The\ncourse highlights Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial\u201d as a \u201cnovel of institution\u201d while drawing\non related works including \u201cThe Castle,\u201d and exploring concepts such as\n\u201cinstitution,\u201d \u201cnovel,\u201d \u201cform of life.\u201d",
