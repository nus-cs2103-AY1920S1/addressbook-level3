== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `Context` object that represents the current application context.
* stores a JSON serializable `InternalState` object in order to keep track of primary key counters for both `Person` and `Activity`.
* stores the Address Book and Activity Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
`Activity` and `Expense` keeps track of the people involved by storing IDs instead of objects, hence there is no direct dependency on the `Person` class.
[]

[NOTE]
Strictly speaking, `Context` only stores a single `Optional<Object>`, which can only be an `Activity` or `Person`. Hence, it is not actually possible for `Context` to contain both and `Activity` and `Person`, unlike what Figure 7 might suggest.
[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::activityclass[]
=== Activity class
`Activity` is a class used to store activities and their details. It contains the following information:

* Primary Key

Each `Activity` has a unique primary key used by external classes to identify and access them, without unnecessary dependencies.

* Title

Title of the activity is stored using `Title`, which runs validations to ensure that the title is valid. Currently, the only restriction for the title is that it can't be blank.

* Participants

Participants are saved internally under `participantIds`, which only stores the primary key of `Contact` involved.

* Expenses incurred by this activity

Expenses are stored as `Expense`. Refer to <<Expense>> for more details. (TBD)

* Outstanding balance for each participant

The balance of each participants are stored internally under `participantBalances`.

All `Activity` objects are stored in `ActivityBook`.

The following class diagram describes the implementation of `Activity`.

.Structure of the Activity class
image::ActivityClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of participant

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only storing the primary key of participants
** *Pros*: Minimizes dependency and potential bugs.
** *Cons*: More difficult for external classes to retrieve participant objects if necessary.
** *Reason for choice*: Storing entire object can potentially cause bugs, as there are no mechanisms to ensure the consistency of data between `Person` object in `Activity` and `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the entire `Person` object inside the `Activity`.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Object can be easily retrieved when necessary.
** Cons: Creates extra dependency between classes. More prone to error.

// tag::createactivity[]
=== Create activity feature
Mechanism to create activity is facilitated by `Activity`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an `ActivityBook`, stored internally as an `activityList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Activity()` -- Constructor used to create a new `Activity`.

All `Activity` models are stored inside `ActivityBook`.

When creating an activity, the title must be specified. It is optional to include participants, as they can be invited separately.

Adding of participant uses both exact-match and keyword-based search. First, the search term passed in is used to find an contact with an exact matching name. If no exact match is found, the search term is split into keywords via whitespace. Obtained keywords are then used to search the AddressBook for a matching person. The person is added in as a participant only if there is one exact match. Otherwise, a warning message will be displayed and no participant will be added for this set of keywords.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create activity mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

Step 2. The user executes `activity t/Breakfast p/David` command to create an activity named Breakfast in the activity book, with David as a participant.

Step 3. The user executes `activity t/Lunch p/Alex p/David` command to create an activity named Lunch in the activity book. In this case, as there are two contacts with the name "Alex", only David is added into the Lunch activity as a participant.

//TODO: Add sequence diagram and Activity diagram showing how this works

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Finding the correct contact to add

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users can use keywords to specify the contact to be added.
** *Pros*: Improves usability.
** *Cons*: Difficult to implement. Necessary to handle multiple edge cases.
** *Reason for choice*: Forcing users to specify exact full name was deemed to be too tedious.

* **Alternative 2:** Users must type in the exact full name of the contact to be added.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Low possibility of bugs.
** Cons: Significantly decreases usability of the application.

// tag::algorithm[]
=== Debt simplification algorithm
The algorithm is inspired by https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2062204/623903.pdf[this paper].

We can gurantee the removal of all needless payments.
The amount of money each person has to hand is minimized.
We are unable to minimize the number of transactions made.
The paper gives an overview of that problem and why it is NP-complete (subset-sum).

==== Operation details
The amounts each person owes to another is represented by a graph in an adjacency matrix.
The algorithm represents the payments to be made as a matrix.
There are some other data structures to facilitate its operation, but the code is generally well commented and they are not major player so we will skip them.
Also note that the matrices are necesarrily skew-symmetric: for example if A owes B $10, then B owes A $-10.

To rephrase our gurantee in this context will be: we want to minimize weights.
We do not care about the number of edges.
Certainly we do not mean each person repeatedly pays out $1, $1, $1!
Our idea of "minimum weights" refer to the total amount someone has to handle.

The lower bound for the amount someone has to handle is the balance.
We create a balance sheeet for the users which is expanded as people enter the activity.
Each expense added, the algorithm retrieves from it:
* who is involved,
* who paid,
* how much has been paid,
splits everything correctly, and updates all the data structures appropriately.

Someone's balance is positive if he received more than he owes.
Then, a negative balance indicates them lending more than they received.
The algorithm simply finds any two people whose balances have opposing signs.
It is unimportant what is the magnitude of their balances (we do not need to take them in any order).
What then happens is then the person with the smallest magnitude of balance neutralizes his balance by paying or being paid by the other party.
The algorithm terminates when all balances are 0.

==== Proof of optimality
This is a short proof of optimality since we want it to be called "algorithm", not "heuristic".

In essence what we are constructing is a bipartite graph.
The algorithm never allows someone who owes to be paid, or someone who is owed to pay even more.
Hence we can classify all nodes into those with leaving edges (payers) and those with entering edges (payee).

In a bipartite graph the amount each person handles is minimized.
To see why, we have to keep in mind that the algorithm always neutralizes one of the parties' balance.
That is to say, we will not be left with the case where someone who could pay off all his debts "overpaying".
In such a case, someone will then have to pay him back, which means it is no longer bipartite.

==== Time and Space complexity
We take O(N^2) space and O(N) time.
Updating of the balance sheet and matrices by the expense command is performed in O(1) time.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Precision

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Just use `double`.
** *Pros*: Easy, straightforward, good enough.
** *Cons*: Floating point precision might stack up.
** *Reason for choice*: For everyday purposes it is highly unlikely currencies (normally at most 2 decimal points) require any higher precision. This is for normal friends, not stockbrokers.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a `Rational` class for rational numbers.
** Pros: Guranteed precision.
** Cons: Seems overkill and needlessly over-engineered.
// end::algorithm[]

=== List feature

The List mechanism is facilitated by the combination of three classes `MainWindow`, `Model` and `Context`.

`Context` is an immutable utility class that describes the nature of the current view of the app. It stores state information about the `ContextType` as well as an optional `Object` of interest. A `Context` may be instantiated either by

* one of the factory methods `newListActivityContext` or `newListContactContext`
* invoking the constructor with either an `Activity` or `Contact` of interest

The `Context` class exposes relevant getter methods `Context#getType`, `Context#getActivity` and `Context#getContact`, and thus supports contextual behaviour of other commands.

During execution, the List command creates the intended `Context` and updates the `Model` with it, along with the appropriate `FilteredList`. As `MainWindow` tracks both `FilteredList`, JavaFX will automatically re-render the contained card entries when the respective list undergoes structural changes.

The updated `ContextType` of the `Model` is then returned to the `MainWindow` UI controller via the `CommandResult`, where it is used to switch the content displayed.

Given below is an example usage scenario of a user intending to view the list of activities.

Step 1. The user launches the `SplitWiser` application for the first time, which defaults to displaying the list of contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command string `list a/` to prompt the app to display the full list of activities.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the role of the respective components.

image::ViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: representing the current context state

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creating an immutable `Context` class as a state container to store the appropriate information.
** Pros: Lightweight; context state can be easily passed between components that require access, as it is encapsulated entirely within `Context`.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the `Context` state in a designated central component, e.g. the `ModelManager`, and exposing relevant methods to other components.
** Pros: Trivial to implement.
** Cons: Tightly couples all components that require access to the context state to the central component, complicating testing.

// tag::invitedisinvite[]
=== Invite/Disinvite feature
==== Implementation

The invite/disinvite mechanism is facilitated by `Activity`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an `ActivityBook`, stored internally as an `activityList`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Activity#invite()` -- Invites a person to the activity.
* `Activity#disinvite()` -- Disinvites a person from the activity.

These operations are exposed in the `Activity` class as `Activity#invite()` and `Activity#disinvite()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the invite/disinvite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

Step 2. The user executes `activity t/breakfast p/David` command to create an activity named breakfast with `David` as the sole participant which is stored in the `activityList`.

Step 3. The user executes `invite p/Louis p/Mary...` to invite more participants into the current viewed activity. The `invite` command calls `Activity#invite()`, inviting more participants into the activity. The `activityList` will then be modified with the newly invited participants which is then stored in the `ActivityBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the invite operation works:

image::InviteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `InviteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 4. The user decides that inviting the person was a mistake or the particular person has not been involved in any of the expenses in the activity. Therefore, it is perfectly fine to remove that person from the activity since he does not owe money to anyone and no one else owes him money.
Hence the user decides to remove that person by executing the `disinvite` command.

Step 5. The user executes `disinvite p/Louis p/David ...` to remove participant(s) from the current activity. The `disinvite` command calls `Activity#disinvite()`, removing participants from the activity. The `activityList` will then be modified due to a change in participants which is then stored in the `ActivityBook`.

NOTE: The sequence diagram for the disinvite operation is omitted as it is similar to the invite operation.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an invite command:

image::InviteActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The activity diagram for the disinvite command is omitted as it is similar to the invite operation.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How invite & disinvite executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Contextual based invite/disinvite based on current viewed activity.
** Pros: More user-friendly. Users do not have to keep specifying which activity to invite the participants to each time an invite command is made.
** Cons: Harder to implement. Have to consider which activity to invite the participants to based on the current viewed activity.

* **Alternative 2:** Invite/disinvite based on user specifying the activity number.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Have to keep retyping activity number if multiple invites/disinvites are needed.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the invite/disinvite commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the participants' ID in the activity instead of participants.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Have to find particular participant that matches the ID specified.

* **Alternative 2:** Use list to store participants instead of ID
** Pros: Easy to implement. Reuse what is already in the codebase and we do not need to create additional Unique ID key for each participant to identify them.
** Cons: Might create duplicate person object when reading from multiple json files if not implemented properly.
// end::invitedisinvite[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Open the terminal.
.. Navigate to where you saved the jar file.
.. Execute the file with `java -jar <name of jar>` +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.
