== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `Context` object that represents the current application context.
* stores a JSON serializable `InternalState` object in order to keep track of primary key counters for both `Person` and `Activity`.
* stores the Address Book and Activity Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
`Activity` and `Expense` keeps track of the people involved by storing IDs instead of objects, hence there is no direct dependency on the `Person` class.
[]

[NOTE]
Strictly speaking, `Context` only stores a single `Optional<Object>`, which can only be an `Activity` or `Person`. Hence, it is not actually possible for `Context` to contain both and `Activity` and `Person`, unlike what Figure 7 might suggest.
[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::activityclass[]
=== Activity class
`Activity` is a class used to store activities and their details. It contains the following information:

* Primary Key

Each `Activity` has a unique primary key used by external classes to identify and access them, without unnecessary dependencies.

* Title

Title of the activity is stored using `Title`, which runs validations to ensure that the title is valid. Currently, the only restriction for the title is that it can't be blank.

* Participants

Participants are saved internally under `participantIds`, which only stores the primary key of `Person` involved.

* Expenses incurred by this activity

Expenses are stored as `Expense`. Refer to <<Expense class>> for more details.

* Outstanding balance for each participant

The balance of each participants are stored internally under `participantBalances`.

All `Activity` objects are stored in `ActivityBook`.

The following class diagram describes the implementation of `Activity`.

.Structure of the Activity class
image::ActivityClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of participant

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only storing the primary key of participants
** *Pros*: Minimizes dependency and potential bugs.
** *Cons*: More difficult for external classes to retrieve participant objects if necessary.
** *Reason for choice*: Storing entire object can potentially cause bugs, as there are no mechanisms to ensure the consistency of data between `Person` object in `Activity` and `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the entire `Person` object inside the `Activity`.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Object can be easily retrieved when necessary.
** Cons: Creates extra dependency between classes. More prone to error.

// tag::createactivity[]
=== Create activity feature
Mechanism to create activity is facilitated by `Activity`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an `ActivityBook`, stored internally as an `activityList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Activity()` -- Constructor used to create a new `Activity`.

All `Activity` models are stored inside `ActivityBook`.

When creating an activity, the title must be specified. It is optional to include participants, as they can be invited separately using the invite command. Refer to <<Invite/Disinvite feature>> for more information. 

Adding of participant uses both exact-match and keyword-based search. First, the search term passed in is used to find an contact with an exact matching name. If no exact match is found, the search term is split into keywords via whitespace. Obtained keywords are then used to search the AddressBook for a matching person. The person is added in as a participant only if there is one exact match. Otherwise, a warning message will be displayed and no participant will be added for this set of keywords.

The aforementioned mechanism was applied to minimize friction for users in using this feature. In early stages of development, it was concluded that making users type in the full name every time was seen as overly tedious. Making use of keyword-based search ensures that the users will only have to type in minimum amount of information to add a person.

Exact matching is always used first to overcome a specific edge case where a contact could not be added, if its name was a substring of another contact's name. Using exact-matching before applying keyword-based matching helps avoid this problem.

Here is a sample use case in creating an expense:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `activity t/Breakfast p/David` command to create an activity named Breakfast in the activity book, with David as a participant.

**Step 3.** The user executes `activity t/Lunch p/Alex p/David` command to create an activity named Lunch in the activity book. In this case, as there are two contacts with the name "Alex", this search term is considered invalid, and only David is added into the Lunch activity as a participant.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how creating activity works:

image::CreateActivitySequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ActivityCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Finding the correct contact to add

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users can use keywords to specify the contact to be added.
** *Pros*: Improves usability.
** *Cons*: Difficult to implement. Necessary to handle multiple edge cases.
** *Reason for choice*: Forcing users to specify exact full name was deemed to be too tedious.

* **Alternative 2:** Users must type in the exact full name of the contact to be added.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Low possibility of bugs.
** Cons: Significantly decreases usability of the application.

// tag::expense[]
=== Expense class
`Expense` is a class used to record expense information. It contains the following information:

* Paying person

Each expense must be paid by someone, which is recorded as `personId` internally. As the name suggests, only the primary key of the `Person` paying is stored.

* Other involved people

Each expense also involves some people who will be taken to owe money to the paying person. This is recorded as `involvedIds[]` internally, which only stores the primary key of each involved person.

* Amount

The amount of money spent. The value of an `Amount` is stored as a `double`, and must be non-negative.

* Description

The description of an expense. The description may be blank if the user chooses to not describe what it is about.

* Deleted flag

This flag tracks whether an expense has been marked as deleted or not, and is stored as a boolean value `isDeleted`. For accountability purposes, we do not allow an `Expense` to be deleted from an `Activity` entirely, and instead use this flag to keep track of it. Expenses can only be fully deleted by deleting the entire activity.

* Settlement flag

SplitWiser supports 2 main types of "expenses": one is an actual expense, and the other is a transaction between people to pay off debts. The latter is what we call a settlement, and is indicated by the boolean `isSettlement`.

The following diagram describes the structure of the `Expense` class:

.Structure of the Expense class
image::ExpenseClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How to actually represent an `Expense`
* **Alternative 1**: An expense is represented by a paying person and an amount. Everyone in the activity is then taken to owe the paying person an equal portion of the paid amount.
** **Pros:** Extremely simple to use.
** **Cons:** Overly idealised and simplified and assumes that everyone is involved in every expense. This severely hinders its utility in real scenarios as this is unable to account for even simple deviations in debt patterns.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: An expense is represented by a paying person, amount, and a list of people involved. Everyone who is specified to be involved then owes an equal portion of the paid amount to the paying person.
** **Pros:** Reasonable flexibility as it enables a wide range of possible expense sharing combinations.
** **Cons:** Forces equal split among participants in the involved list, which is still going to result in limited utility in some real scenarios. A simple example would be that a group of people can have a meal together but each person's meal would cost a different amount.
** **Reason for choice:** Although the above con can be a very real issue from a user's standpoint, we believe this is the best balance between flexibility and usability.

* **Alternative 3**: An expense is represented by a paying person, an amount, a list of paying people and the amount each person should pay back the paying person.
** **Pros:** Ultimate flexibility and addresses the con above.
** **Cons:** Significantly complicates the backend management of expenses. While this is something that will definitely be addressed in future versions of SplitWiser (e.g. adding a new `varexpense` command that enables this), we opted for a simpler version of `Expense` due to time constraints. The areas that need to be taken into consideration include (but may not limited to):
*** Design of the command for the user in a way that is intuitive
*** Managing the event that the amount list does not add up to the amount paid
*** GUI representation of the more generalised version of `Expense`
// end::expense[]

// tag::createexpense[]
=== Create expense feature
The mechanism to create expenses is facilitated by `Expense`. Each `Activity` stores a list of `Expense` called `expenses`, representing the expenses incurred in the course of this activity.

When creating an expense, an amount and at least one person (the paying person) must be specified, and information about an expense cannot be modified once it is created. The only exception to this would be to delete an expense, but expenses also cannot be un-deleted once marked as deleted.



In terms of the name searching logic to actually identify who is involved, it is identical to that which is used in the creation of activities (see <<Create activity feature>>), but with a few key differences: +

1. The expense will only be created if **all** sets of keywords result in a unique match. For instance, if the user specifies `p/John Doe p/Mary p/James`, but only the keyword `James` does not successfully identify a unique person, then the entire expense will not be created.
2. The search scope is contextual. If creating an expense outside an activity context, it will search for matches in the entire Address Book. However, in an activity context, it will only search for matches among existing activity participants.

Here, it is important to realise that duplicating the name searching logic ensures a consistent user experience, as the user has no reason to expect that the search behaviour would be different. For example, if `john` was successfully used to identify a contact named `John Doe` when creating an activity, the user has no reason to expect that `john` would not be able to identify `John Doe` for an expense.

Here is a sample use case in creating an expense:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `activity t/breakfast p/Jo p/Bob p/Alice` command to create an activity named breakfast with 3 participants added to the activity. The context is then switched to this new activity.

**Step 3.** The user executes `expense p/Jo e/10` to indicate that Jo paid $10 for something (unnamed as description is not specified) that is shared by everyone i.e. Bob and Alice. This happens because the default behaviour for `expense` is to assume everyone is involved if no one else is specified explicitly. `expense` command calls `Activity#addExpense()` and adds the new expense into the activity. The debt algorithm will then instantly recompute the debt matrix (see <<Debt simplification algorithm>>) for the activity, and store the expense object inside the activity's expense list (i.e. `expenses`).

The following sequence diagram shows how the expense adding operation works:

image::ExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ExpenseCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// end::createexpense[]
// tag::algorithm[]
=== Debt simplification algorithm
The algorithm is inspired by https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2062204/623903.pdf[this paper].

We can gurantee the removal of all needless payments.
The amount of money each person has to hand is minimized.
We are unable to minimize the number of transactions made.
The paper gives an overview of that problem and why it is NP-complete (subset-sum).

==== Operation details
The amounts each person owes to another is represented by a graph in an adjacency matrix.
The algorithm represents the payments to be made as a matrix.
There are some other data structures to facilitate its operation, but the code is generally well commented and they are not major player so we will skip them.

To rephrase our gurantee in this context will be: we want to minimize weights.
That is, the total amount of money someone will have to touch is minimized.

The lower bound for the amount someone has to handle is the balance.
We create a balance sheeet for the users which is expanded as people enter the activity.
Each expense added, the algorithm retrieves from it:
* who is involved,
* who paid,
* how much has been paid,
splits everything correctly, and updates all the data structures appropriately.

Someone's balance is positive if he received more than he owes.
Then, a negative balance indicates them lending more than they received.
The algorithm simply finds any two people whose balances have opposing signs.
It is unimportant what is the magnitude of their balances (we do not need to take them in any order).
What then happens is then the person with the smallest magnitude of balance neutralizes his balance by paying or being paid by the other party.
The algorithm terminates when all balances are 0.

==== Proof of optimality
This is a short proof of optimality since we want it to be called "algorithm", not "heuristic".

In essence what we are constructing is a bipartite graph.
The algorithm never allows someone who owes to be paid, or someone who is owed to pay even more.
Hence we can classify all nodes into those with leaving edges (payers) and those with entering edges (payee).

In a bipartite graph the amount each person handles is minimized.
To see why, we have to keep in mind that the algorithm always neutralizes one of the parties' balance.
That is to say, we will not be left with the case where someone who could pay off all his debts "overpaying".
In such a case, someone will then have to pay him back, which means it is no longer bipartite.

==== Time and Space complexity
We take O(N^2) space and O(N) time.
Updating of the balance sheet and matrices by the expense command is performed in O(1) time.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Precision

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Just use `double`.
** *Pros*: Easy, straightforward, good enough.
** *Cons*: Floating point precision might stack up.
** *Reason for choice*: For everyday purposes it is highly unlikely currencies (normally at most 2 decimal points) require any higher precision. This is for normal friends, not stockbrokers.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a `Rational` class for rational numbers.
** Pros: Guranteed precision.
** Cons: Seems overkill and needlessly over-engineered.
// end::algorithm[]

=== List feature

The List mechanism is facilitated by the combination of three classes `MainWindow`, `Model` and `Context`.

`Context` is an immutable utility class that describes the nature of the current view of the app. It stores state information about the `ContextType` as well as an optional `Object` of interest. A `Context` may be instantiated either by

* one of the factory methods `newListActivityContext` or `newListContactContext`
* invoking the constructor with either an `Activity` or `Contact` of interest

The `Context` class exposes relevant getter methods `Context#getType`, `Context#getActivity` and `Context#getContact`, and thus supports contextual behaviour of other commands.

During execution, the List command creates the intended `Context` and updates the `Model` with it, along with the appropriate `FilteredList`. As `MainWindow` tracks both `FilteredList`, JavaFX will automatically re-render the contained card entries when the respective list undergoes structural changes.

The updated `ContextType` of the `Model` is then returned to the `MainWindow` UI controller via the `CommandResult`, where it is used to switch the content displayed.

Given below is an example usage scenario of a user intending to view the list of activities.

Step 1. The user launches the `SplitWiser` application for the first time, which defaults to displaying the list of contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command string `list a/` to prompt the app to display the full list of activities.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the role of the respective components.

image::ViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: representing the current context state

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creating an immutable `Context` class as a state container to store the appropriate information.
** Pros: Lightweight; context state can be easily passed between components that require access, as it is encapsulated entirely within `Context`.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the `Context` state in a designated central component, e.g. the `ModelManager`, and exposing relevant methods to other components.
** Pros: Trivial to implement.
** Cons: Tightly couples all components that require access to the context state to the central component, complicating testing.

// tag::invitedisinvite[]
=== Invite/Disinvite feature
==== Implementation

The invite/disinvite mechanism is facilitated by `Activity`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an `ActivityBook`, stored internally as an `activityList`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Activity#invite()` -- Invites a person to the activity.
* `Activity#disinvite()` -- Disinvites a person from the activity.

These operations are exposed in the `Activity` class as `Activity#invite()` and `Activity#disinvite()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the invite/disinvite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

Step 2. The user executes `activity t/breakfast p/David` command to create an activity named breakfast with `David` as the sole participant which is stored in the `activityList`.

Step 3. The user executes `invite p/Louis p/Mary...` to invite more participants into the current viewed activity. The `invite` command calls `Activity#invite()`, inviting more participants into the activity. The `activityList` will then be modified with the newly invited participants which is then stored in the `ActivityBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the invite operation works:

image::InviteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `InviteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 4. The user decides that inviting the person was a mistake or the particular person has not been involved in any of the expenses in the activity. Therefore, it is perfectly fine to remove that person from the activity since he does not owe money to anyone and no one else owes him money.
Hence the user decides to remove that person by executing the `disinvite` command.

Step 5. The user executes `disinvite p/Louis p/David ...` to remove participant(s) from the current activity. The `disinvite` command calls `Activity#disinvite()`, removing participants from the activity. The `activityList` will then be modified due to a change in participants which is then stored in the `ActivityBook`.

NOTE: The sequence diagram for the disinvite operation is omitted as it is similar to the invite operation.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an invite command:

image::InviteActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The activity diagram for the disinvite command is omitted as it is similar to the invite operation.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How invite & disinvite executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Contextual based invite/disinvite based on current viewed activity.
** Pros: More user-friendly. Users do not have to keep specifying which activity to invite the participants to each time an invite command is made.
** Cons: Harder to implement. Have to consider which activity to invite the participants to based on the current viewed activity.

* **Alternative 2:** Invite/disinvite based on user specifying the activity number.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Have to keep retyping activity number if multiple invites/disinvites are needed.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the invite/disinvite commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the participants' ID in the activity instead of participants.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Have to find particular participant that matches the ID specified.

* **Alternative 2:** Use list to store participants instead of ID
** Pros: Easy to implement. Reuse what is already in the codebase and we do not need to create additional Unique ID key for each participant to identify them.
** Cons: Might create duplicate person object when reading from multiple json files if not implemented properly.
// end::invitedisinvite[]

//tag::delete[]
=== Delete feature
==== Implementation

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`, `ActivityBook`, as well as `Activity`. +
The items that will be deleted can be contact/activity/expense depending on your current display.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.  `SplitWiser` will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.

Step 2. The user executes `list c/` command to display list contacts screen.

Step 3. The user executes `delete 1` to delete the contact at the first index if he/she is not involved in any activities.

Step 4. The user executes `list a/` to display list activities screen.

Step 5. The user executes `delete 1` again, but this time the activity at the first index will be deleted instead.

Step 6. The user views an activity at the second index using `view a/2`

Step 7. The user executes `delete 1` again, but this time the expense at the first index will be deleted instead.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command for deletion of activity:

image::DeleteContactActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The activity diagram for deletion of expense and contact are omitted as they are similar to the deletion of activity.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How delete executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Contextual based delete of contact/activity/expense based on current displayed screen.
** Pros: More user-friendly. Users do not have to keep specifying what to delete.
** Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete based on user specifying which field to delete.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Have to keep retyping the field for deletion which is inconvenient.
// end::delete[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Open the terminal.
.. Navigate to where you saved the jar file.
.. Execute the file with `java -jar <name of jar>` +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
