    "description": "When did multi\u2010ethnic China become a nation? Why did island Japan become an empire? From 1800 to the present day, the two main East Asian powers have shifted back and forth between the ideas and institutions of empires and nation\u2010states. These changes shaped policies towards ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities, and diplomatic relations with neighbouring states. This module also integrates current debates on statecraft and imperialism to show the ideas behind important historical turning points remain relevant today. Background in Asian history or International\nRelations is strongly recommended.",
