    "description": "For 2000 years, Southeast Asia has been an important crossroad of world maritime trade, but the study of maritime history and culture have not been well developed on a regional level. The study of maritime culture in Southeast Asia requires integration of data from numerous disciplines including archaeology, history, economics, engineering, and ecology, to name some of the most significant. Singapore\u2019s prosperity depends to a major extent on its port, yet students do not appreciate its importance. This module will explore commercial and cultural links between the Arabo\u2010Persian region, India, Southeast Asia, and China over the past two millennia.",
