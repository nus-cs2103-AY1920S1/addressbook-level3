== Introduction

Wish to get the summer body that the contestants in your school’s
beauty pageant has? Want to shed some weight that you have gained
from stress-eating?

Well wait no more! ExerHealth is a one-stop platform for students
who wish to embark on a journey of health and fitness. This application
is optimised for students who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast and wish to maintain a healthy
lifestyle, ExerHealth is that one app for you!

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `stats t/CAT_NAME`,
`CAT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `stats t/exercise`.
* Words in `lower_case` are the compulsory keywords that inform ExerHealth about the category of
information being added. e.g. `add t/exercise n/EXERCISE_NAME`, `t/exercise` is a keyword that informs ExerHealth about adding to the exercise tracker.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `d/date [m/MUSCLE]` can be used as `d/1/10/2019 m/Legs`
or as `d/1/10/2019`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MUSCLE]...`
can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `m/glutes`, `m/glutes m/chest` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE c/CALORIES`,
`d/DATE c/CALORIES n/NAME` is also acceptable.

// tag::scheduleresolve[]

=== Scheduling exercises: `schedule`
[[scheduleregime]]
==== Schedules a regime

Schedules an exercise regime for a certain date. If the regime clashes with another scheduled regime, you will be prompted to resolve the conflict via a popup window. Refer to <<resolve>> for details on resolving scheduling conflicts.

Format: `schedule n/REGIME_NAME d/DATE`

****
* To schedule a regime, `REGIME_NAME` must exist in your regime list. You can use <<list, `list t/regime`>> command to view the regimes that you currently have.
* The format of `DATE` must be of the form `dd/MM/YYYY`. For example, `12/12/2019` or `01/01/2020`. Even if the number has only one digit, please ensure you include a 0 at the front to ensure that it adheres to the format required.
* You will not be allowed to schedule a regime on a date that falls before the date displayed on your system clock
* You are allowed to schedule a regime of the same name on the same date. The resolve window will pop up for you as per normal.
****
*Example 1:*

* `schedule n/cardio d/12/12/2019`

Schedules the regime called `cardio` on the date `12/12/2019`. If there are no other regimes scheduled on `12/12/2019` then the command is successful. Otherwise, you will be prompted to resolve the scheduling conflict.

Expected Result:

.The `cardio` regime is scheduled on 12/12/2019
image::ScheduleRegimeCardio.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

Expected Result (if other schedule exist on `12/12/2019`):

.The result when a scheduling conflict is detected
image::ScheduleRegimeCardioConflict.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

If the resolve window pops up for you, please refer to <<resolve>> for details on resolving a scheduling conflict.

[[schedulecomplete]]
==== Completes a schedule regime

Once a scheduled regime is completed, you can add that completed schedule to the exercise tracker. The schedule is then deleted from the scheduling list.

Format: `schedule i/INDEX_OF_SCHEDULE`


[TIP]
The `INDEX_OF_SCHEDULE` provided must be a valid index from your schedule list. Please use <<list, `list t/schedule`>> to view the index of the schedule you wish to complete.

*Example:*

* `schedule i/2`

Completes all the exercises that are in the schedule at index `2`. All the exercises scheduled will be added to the exercise list and the schedule at index `2` is deleted.

Expected Result:

Before execution of `schedule i/2`

.Before the execution of the command
image::ScheduleCompleteBefore.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

In your exercise tracker

.Exercises from the schedule are added to your tracker

In your schedule tracker after completing execution of `schedule i/2`

.The completed regime is removed from your schedule
image::ScheduleCompleteScheduleTracker.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

// end::scheduleresolve[]

[[resolve]]
=== Resolving scheduling conflicts: `resolve`
Described in the following two sections are two possible ways to resolve a scheduling conflict in the resolve window that pops up.

****
* Once the resolve window pops up, you are not allowed to interact with the main `ExerHealth` window anymore. You are required to resolve the scheduling conflict before continuing to use the application as normal.
* Any *valid* commands that are not `resolve` will not get executed in the resolve window. Only the `resolve` command is allowed in the resolve window.
****

[[resolvetakeone]]
==== Taking one of the regimes completely

Takes the scheduled regime or the conflicting regime completely and discarding the other. Neither regimes will be deleted from the user’s collection.

Format: `resolve n/SCHEDULED_OR_CONFLICTING`

[TIP]
You can only enter `n/scheduled` or `n/conflicting` to tell ExerHealth which schedule you wish to take. The scheduled or conflicting regimes are stated at the top of the list of exercises as shown below.

.An example of the resolve conflict window
image::ResolveScheduledOrConflicting.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

*Example:*

* `resolve n/scheduled`

Takes the already scheduled regime and schedule it at conflicting date.

*Expected Result:*

The resolve window and inputting the example command

.Selecting all the exercises in the scheduled regime
image::ResolveScheduled.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

Once resolve window closes, the scheduled regime should be taken and scheduled at the correct date.

.The scheduled regime should appear in your scheduling list
image::ResolveScheduledResult.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]


==== Taking some exercises from both regimes
Takes some exercises from the scheduled regime and some from the conflicting regime to make a brand new regime. The new regime will be scheduled at the date of conflict. This new regime will also be added to your collection of regimes.

Format: `resolve n/NEW_REGIME_NAME [i/INDEX_OF_EXERCISE_IN_SCHEDULED] [r/INDEX_OF_EXERCISE_IN_CONFLICTING]`

****
* Takes the exercise at the specified indexes of `i/` and `r/`
* `NEW_REGIME_NAME` must be a new name that does not exist in your collection of regimes
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed resolve window
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* `i/` is for index of the scheduled regime
* `r/` is for index of the conflicting regime
* At least one `i/` or `r/` must exist in your input for this command to succeed. Otherwise, ExerHealth will think you are trying to take one regime completely as stated in the <<resolvetakeone, previous section>>.
****

*Example:*

* `resolve n/new cardio i/1 r/4 r/2`

Expected Result:

Takes exercise `1` from `scheduled regime` and exercises `2` and `4` from `conflicting regime` and adds them to a new regime called `new cardio`

.Selecting some exercises from each regime
image::ResolveTakeOneOrOther.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

The `new cardio` regime is now scheduled at the conflicting date with the new exercises that have been resolved.

.A newly created regime will appear in your scheduling list
image::ResolveTakeResolved.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

The `new cardio` regime is now added to your collection of regimes

.The newly created regime will also appear in your regime list!
image::ResolveRegimeTracker.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]


// tag::suggest[]

[[suggestion]]
=== Suggesting ideas: `suggest`

==== Suggests basic exercises
Recommends exercises from ExerHealth's inbuilt database for beginners.

Format: `suggest s/basic`

==== Suggests possible exercises
Suggests exercises matching specified tags.

===== Based on matching muscle tags
Format: `suggest s/possible o/OPERATION_TYPE [m/MUSCLE CUSTOM_PROPERTY_PREFIX_NAME/VALUE]`

****
* You must choose one of the following operation types: `and` / `or` i.e. commands such as `suggest s/possible m/Chest m/Legs` will fail whereas `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest m/Legs` will succeed.

* You have to enter at least one property (muscle/custom property) to search for suggestions i.e. commands such as
`suggest s/possible o/and` and `suggest s/possible o/or` will both fail
whereas `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest` will succeed.

* The operation type is optional if there is only one tag provided i.e. commands such as
`suggest s/possible o/and m/Chest`, `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest` and `suggest s/possible m/Chest`
will all achieve the same outcome -
display all the exercises tagged with `Chest` in the exercise tracker and ExerHealth's database.
****
===== Based on matching custom properties

Similar to matching muscles tags, you can search for suggestions with matching custom property tags.

After creating <<customproperty, custom properties>> and tracking exercises,
you can search for suggestions with those custom properties.

Example:
Suppose you have created a new custom property and have been tracking a few exercises with said custom property:

1. `custom s/r f/Rating p/Number`

2. `add t/exercise n/Run d/03/11/2019 c/200 q/10 u/km m/Legs r/8`

3. `add t/exercise n/Bench Press d/05/11/2019 c/150 q/40 u/kg m/Chest r/8`


Then, the following input will display a list of exercises which are tagged with `Chest` and have a rating of `8`.

`suggest s/possible o/and m/Chest r/8`

Thus the command will display only the exercise named "Bench Press".

<<<

Expected Result:

.Exercises with a `Chest` tag and a rating of `8` are shown.
image::suggestPossibleAfter1.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

The input, `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest r/8`, however, will display a list of exercises tagged with `Chest` *or* have a rating of `8`.

Expected Result:

.Exercises with a `Chest` tag and exercises with a rating of `8` are shown.
image::suggestPossibleAfter2.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

As shown above, the two previously added exercises, "Bench Press and "Run", are displayed because they each have a rating of `8`.
In addition to the tracked exercises, ExerHealth also displays suggestions in its database. Hence it will display the exercise named "Push Ups" as it has a `Chest` tag.

<<<

===== Duplicates

Sometimes, you may want to track exercises of the same name. Instead of displaying all suggestions of the same name, `suggest`
displays the information of the most recently tracked exercise of that name.
As can be seen below, there are two exercises named "Bench Press".

.Before entering the new suggest command
image::suggestPossibleBefore3.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

Expected Result:

.Only the latest `Bench Press` exercise is displayed
image::suggestPossibleAfter3.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

As seen from the image above, the information from the "Bench Press" on "06/11/2019" is displayed instead of the one on "05/11/2019" (observe that the calories are different).
// end::suggest[]

// tag::customfeature[]
[[customproperty]]
=== Custom properties `custom` / `viewcustom`

==== Adding custom properties: `custom`

Adds in a custom property which you can define for the exercises.

Once a new custom property is created, you can simply use the prefix name which you defined for the
property in the `add` and `edit` command to include information for the new property.

****
* The prefix name can only contain alphabets and should not contain spaces.
* You must choose exactly one of the following as the parameter type for your custom property:
`Text`, `Number`, `Date`.
* Every word in the full name of each custom property will be changed to Start Case style, where the first letter of each
word is capitalised with the other letters in lower case e.g. `enD DaTe` will be changed to `End Date`.
* The date entered for custom properties with a `DATE` parameter must follow the same requirements as that of <<addexercise, add>> command.
* The text entered for custom properties with a `TEXT` parameter can contain only alphabets.
* The number entered for custom properties with a `NUMBER` parameter must be non-negative.
* You need not include the custom properties when adding a new exercise to the app.
****

Format: `custom s/PREFIX_NAME f/FULL_NAME p/PARAMETER_TYPE`

[TIP]
The following names and prefix names have been used for existing add / edit command parameters and properties and so,
cannot be used.
|===========
|Names used | Prefix names used
|Name       |  n
|Date       |  d
|Calories   |  c
|Quantity   |  q
|Unit       |  u
|Muscle     |  m
|-          |  t
|-          |  i
|===========

Example:

* `custom s/r f/Rating p/Number`

Creates a `Rating` property for each of your exercises.

Expected Result:

.Your rating property has been created
image::CustomRating.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

You can now add a new exercise with `Rating`!

* `add t/exercise n/Run d/07/11/2019 c/400 q/2.4 u/km r/5`

Expected Result:

.A new exercise with the remark property is added
image::AddCustomRating.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

==== Removing custom properties: `custom`

Removes a custom property which you have previously defined either from a single exercise
or from ExerHealth.

In the second case, you will still be able to add back the deleted custom property if you
wish to.

****
* `FULL_NAME` denotes the name of the previously defined custom property.
* The index, if provided, must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
****

Format: `custom rm/FULL_NAME [i/INDEX]`

Example:

* `custom rm/Rating`

Before the execution, the `Rating` property will be present in exercises that have them.

.A rating of 4.5 for exercise 6
image::EditCustomRating.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

.A rating of 3.5 for exercise 7
image::EditAnotherCustomRating.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

After the execution, the `Rating` property will be removed from all of the exercises and the app
as illustrated in the next few figures.

.Rating in exercise 6 is removed
image::RunRatingRemoved.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

.Rating in exercise 7 is also removed
image::BenchPressRatingRemoved.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

// end::customfeature[]

* `custom rm/Rating i/6`

Before the execution, both exercises 6 and 7 have a rating attached to them.

.A rating of 4.5 for exercise 6
image::EditCustomRating.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

.A rating of 3.5 for exercise 7
image::EditAnotherCustomRating.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

After the execution, only exercise 6 has its rating property removed.

.The rating for exercise 6 is removed
image::RatingRemovedForSix.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

.The rating for exercise 7 remains
image::RatingRemainedForSeven.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

==== Viewing custom properties: `viewcustom`

Opens up a window for you to view the custom properties you have defined.
The name, prefix and parameter type of all existing custom properties will be shown.

Note that the window shows the custom properties that are present in the app at the time
that it was opened. Any new addition/deletion will not be reflected unless the `viewcustom` command
is used again.

Format: `viewcustom`

Example:

* `viewcustom`

Expected Result:

.A window showing the custom properties you have defined is opened
image::ViewCustom.png[align="center", width=85%, scaledwidth=15cm]

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ExerHealth folder.

*Q*: There are times where a `null` message appears in the result display. What should I do?

.A null message appeared
image::NullMessage.png[align="center", width="400"]

*A*: Fear not! Simply restart the app and the `null` message will go away.

*Q*: Exercises with long names are cut off in the info panel. Are there any way for me to view the names of
these exercises? +
*A*: Hover your mouse over the exercise's name and a friendly tooltip will appear to display its full name.
The same thing can also be done for custom properties!
