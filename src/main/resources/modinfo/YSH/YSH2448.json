    "description": "This class is designed to address our ever-increasing illiteracy about materials and processes. The class will begin with an introduction to object-driven inquiry which begins on the inside of an object and works outwards towards the final product and its context. With a foundation in this method, we will then focus each successive class upon a specific global object of the early modern period. We will discuss objects not simply as reflections of values, but as active, symbolic agents that emerge in specific contexts yet might change in form, use, or value over space and time.",
