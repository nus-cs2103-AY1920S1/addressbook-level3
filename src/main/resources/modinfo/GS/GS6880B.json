    "description": "Primarily lectures, discussions, and readings in a research or development topic across disciplinary boundaries. Themes are selected to immerse students in work that is amenable to integrative approaches. Topics are organized with background and current research lectures and discussions, followed by students presenting projects and leading discussion with faculty mentoring. In a semester, students chose capsules among available themes or participate in all capsules of a single theme. 1 capsule (1MC) consists of 1 class (2h) per week for 3 weeks. The capsule topic will be introduced in the first class (the 'what' session), followed by interactive presentations and discussions by both the lecturer as well as students in the second (the 'why' session) and third class (the 'how' session).",
