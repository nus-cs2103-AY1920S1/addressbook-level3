    "description": "This course will provide an overview of the basic economic theory that underlies competition law, an area of law that has expanded dramatically around the world in recent years. Various topics will be covered, including an economic analysis of efficiency and why competition matters from the perspective of social welfare, horizontal agreements, mergers, vertical restraints, and exclusion of competitors. While the course will not attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of antitrust law, relevant economic theory will be discussed in the context of legal cases taken from different jurisdictions around the world (most prominently the United States and Europe).",
