== Preface

Excited to start using _TravEzy_? Read this section to find out how this document is structured, and what each symbol and special font style mean. We promise that this will help you to get started with using _TravEzy_ more quickly! 😊

=== Structure of this Document

There are *alot* of things that TravEzy can do. So, we have organised this document such that you can easily look for what *you* need.

We've split up this guide into the different features of our application, namely:

. Main
. Calendar
. Itinerary
. Address Book
. Diary
. Achievements


In each of the above sections, you will be introduced to the *interface* of the feature (how TravEzy looks), the *_parameters_* (which are just like those fields you
fill up in a regular form📝) and the *commands* that will allow you to start *travelling easy*.


=== Reading this Document

Symbols and fanciful (okay, different) fonts are exciting, aren't they? Let's find out more about what they mean in this document!

.Symbols and fonts (rows)
[grid="rows", frame="none"]

| ``m\MONTH``
| The slash and letter (or word) before the _parameter_ is a _prefix_. It is used to separate the current _parameter_ from other _parameters_.

| ``[m\MONTH]``
| Square brackets imply that the the stated _prefix_ and _parameter_ are optional. (This means less typing! 😆)

== Main
Hi!

Main is the welcome screen for TravEzy. From here, you can navigate to the other pages, such as calendar,
financial tracker, achievements etc. You can also the exit the application from here.

Don't worry! You can also navigate to other pages
and exit when you are already inside in a page such as itinerary.

=== Navigating our application with

Trying to open up the achievements page? Use the *Go To Command*:

*Go To another page: ``goto``*

Allows you to navigate to different pages (from any page), with the possible pages being:

. main
. calendar
. itinerary
. address_book
. financial_tracker
. diary
. achievements

The _Command Word_ is `goto` and the parameter can be any of the pages listed above. There is no
need for a _Prefix_.

Format: ``goto page``

Example: Let's say I want to go back to the main page to see the beautiful TravEzy logo -

``goto main``


=== Exit Command

It's time to catch your flight! Better exit TravEzy using the *Exit Command* and
start your trip!

*Exit TravEzy: ``exit``*

Allows you to exit from TravEzy

The _Command Word_ is `exit` and there are no additonal parameters.

Format: ``exit``

Example: Let's say I have to exit the calendar page -

``exit``

== Calendar

It's the end of the semester but there are still orientation camps, internships, and family commitments to attend to. However, the desire to unwind by travelling after a long and tiring semester is just *too strong*. Sounds like you?

Well, _TravEzy_ has got you covered. Simply inform _TravEzy_ of your schedule (your _commitments_, _school breaks_, public _holidays_ and _trips_) and _TravEzy_ will suggest periods of time when you can travel! Excited to find out more? Well... Read on!

=== Interface

=== Parameters

Let us find out what the main _parameters_ for calendar are.


. ``DAY``. This refers to the day of the month (e.g. *1*, *2*, ..., *31* of January). To specify the day, simply place the _prefix_ ``d/`` before it.
+
For example, if you would like to specify that it is first of January, key in:

    d/1


. ``MONTH``. This refers to which month (i.e. *January*, *February*, *March*, ..., *December*) you would like to refer to. To specify the month, just place the _prefix_ ``m/`` before the month. 
+
Since people have different ways of specifying month, _TravEzy_ accommodates these differences. In particular, you may choose to refer to it using numbers (with *1* referring to *January*, *2* referring to *February*, etc.) or you may refer to it using words. Please type *at least first three letters* of the month 😄.
+
Referring to the previous example, to specify that it is January, you can type:

    m/1

+
or you can type:

    m/Jan

+
or:

    m/January

. ``YEAR``. This refers to which year (i.e. *2019*, *2020*, ...) you are referring to. To indicate the year, prepend the year you are referring to with ``y/``. Since _TravEzy_ allows you to refer to any year between 1980 and 2200 (because travelling in time is fun too!), please key in a *4 digit number* . If otherwise, it would be confused 😔.
+
For instance, if you want to specify the year 2019, just key in:

    y/2019

. ``END DAY``. This refers to the day of an event's end date. This is very similar to how you would specify the (start) ``DAY``, as mentioned in point 1. Now, instead of using the small letter, use the upper-case version. In other words, ``D/``.
+
For example, if you would like to indicate that your event (i.e. _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ or _trip_) ends on fifth of January, enter:

    D/5

. ``END MONTH``. This refers to the month of an event's end date. Again, this is very similar to how you would specify the (start) ``MONTH``, as mentioned in point 2. Now, instead of using the small letter, use the upper-case version ``M/``.
+
Following from the above example, if you would like to state that your event (i.e. _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ or _trip_) ends in January, just type:

    M/1
+
Alternatively, if you are more comfortable with spelling the month out in words, TravEzy also understands:

    M/Jan
+
and:

    M/January
+
WARNING: As with the above (``MONTH``), if you are spelling ``END MONTH`` in words, please specify it with *at least first three letters* of the month.

. ``END YEAR``. This refers to the year of an event's end date. To specify the year of the end date, key in the upper-case version instead. In essence, place the _prefix_ ``Y/`` before the year of the end date. Isn't it simple?
+
For instance, if your trip ends in 2020, just type:

    Y/2020
+
WARNING: As with the above (``YEAR``), please specify ``END YEAR`` using *four digits*.
+
TIP: As expected, specifying the ``END DAY``, ``END MONTH`` and/or ``END YEAR`` is not always applicable. Hence, by default, _TravEzy_ assumes that the ``END DAY``, ``END MONTH`` and/or ``END YEAR`` are the same as ``DAY``, ``MONTH`` and/or ``YEAR`` respectively.

. ``NAME``. This refers to the name of your event (i.e. _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ or _trip_). To indicate the name, just key in ``n/`` before it.
+
For instance, if you would like to specify that the holiday you are adding refers to Christmas 🎄 , just type:

    n/Christmas

. ``EVENT TYPE``. This refers to either a _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ or _trip_. With this parameter, you can easily differentiate the different events in your calendar!
+
Are you unable to travel on a particular day or over a duration of time due to _commitments_? Well, indicate it with ``commitment``!
+
For instance, if you have volunteered to tutor children from 2 to 5 December 2019, you can refer to it by typing:

    commitment n/volunteer to tutor children d/2 m/Dec y/2019 D/5 M/Dec Y/2019

+
Now, _TravEzy_ would know that the event is in fact a _commitment_!
+
{empty} +
Or is there an upcoming public _holiday_? Then, key it in with the type ``holiday``.
+
For example, to refer to the fact that 1 May 2020 is labour day (a public _holiday_), just enter:

    holiday n/labour day d/1 m/May y/2020

+
Now, _TravEzy_ would recognise that day as a public _holiday_!
+
{empty} +
You might then be wondering, what if it is a _school break_? As you might have expected, _TravEzy_ has got that covered too! Just indicate that the event is in fact a _school break_ by keying in ``school_break``.
+
For instance, if you would like to refer to the fact that 8 Dec 2019 to 12 Jan 2020 is winter vacation (a _school break_), just type:

    school_break n/winter vacation d/8 m/Dec y/2019 D/12 M/Jan Y/2020

+
Yeah! Now, _TravEzy_ know that you are referring to a _school break_. 😉
+
{empty} +
Last but not least, you can specify that you will be away for a _trip_ (woo hoo!) by using the ``EVENT TYPE`` ``trip``.
+
For example, to refer to your Bali trip between 10 Dec 2019 to 13 Dec 2019, simply enter:

    trip n/Bali 3D2N d/10 m/Dec y/2019 D/13 M/Dec Y/2019

+
Great! Now, _TravEzy_ is aware that you are referring to a _trip_.

. ``PERIOD``. This refers to the number of days between the start date and end date (as specified using the above parameters). To use it, simply place the prefix ``p/`` before specifying the number of days.
+
For example, if you would like to indicate that it needs to be a period of 5 days, key in:

    p/5

WARNING: Some commands do not use all of the above _parameters_ and _prefixes_. If the _parameters_ and _prefixes_ are not recognised, note that _TravEzy_ will treat them as regular text.

=== Adding an event to your calendar: ``add``

Whew! After reading so much, it is time to find out how you can add your event (be it your _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ or _trip_) so that _TravEzy_ can start suggesting when you can travel! 😊

*Format:* +
``add EVENT TYPE n/NAME d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To add a commitment,

* To add a holiday,

    add holiday n/labour day d/1 m/May y/2020

* To add a school break,

****

*Step by step:*
(To indicate that you have a commitment rom 2 Dec 2019 to 5 Dec 2019 because you are volunteering, just key in... COMING SOON)

TIP: As mentioned, you do not have to specify the ``END YEAR``, ``END MONTH`` and/or ``END DAY`` if they are the same as ``START YEAR``, ``START MONTH`` and/or ``START DAY``, respectively.

WARNING: If you leave out the month and/or year, the current month and/or year will be used. This applies to the following commands as well.

=== Deleting an event from your calendar: ``delete``

Yes, we have all had that experience. We thought that next Friday is a public _holiday_ even though it isn't. However, you have added this _holiday_ to _TravEzy_! 😧 What should you do now? Delete it!

But how? Well, this is the section for you. 😀

*Format:* +
``delete EVENT TYPE n/NAME d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To delete a commitment,

    delete commitment n/volunteer to tutor children d/2 m/Dec y/2019 D/5 M/Dec Y/2019

* To delete a holiday,

    delete holiday n/labour day d/1 m/May y/2020

* To delete a school break,

    delete school_break n/winter vacation d/8 m/Dec y/2019 D/12 M/Jan Y/2020

* To delete a trip,

    delete trip n/Bali 3D2N d/10 m/Dec y/2019 D/13 M/Dec Y/2019

****

*Step by step:*
(You have accidentally indicated that 13 August 2019 is an observed holiday for national day and you would like to delete it from TravEzy. MORE COMING SOON...)

=== Showing your schedule for the month: ``show``

After adding and deleting your events, you can have an overview of them!

How easy is it?

*Format:* +
``show m/MONTH [y/YEAR]``

*Example:* +

    show m/Dec


WARNING: Do remember that if you leave out the year (as we have done in this example), the current year will be used. This applies to the following commands as well.

*Step by step:*
(COMING SOON)

=== Listing your events: ``list``

If you would like to view your events as a list instead, this command would be helpful!

*Format:* +
``list [d/START DAY] [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****

****

=== Checking your availability for a trip: ``check``

Do you need to find out whether you are available to go for a trip? You can get _TravEzy_ to find that out for you (i.e. when you happen to have a school break/holiday then *and* do not have any commitment/trip then).

Let's find out how!

*Format:* +
``check d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To check whether you are available on 9 December 2019,

    check d/9 m/12 y/2019

* To check whether you are available from 9 to 20 December 2019,

    check d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019

****

*Step by step:*
(COMING SOON)

=== Suggesting a suitable time for a trip: ``suggest``

The end of the semester is near. It is time to look for some cheap flights🛫! However, before deciding which flight to book, you need to find out whether it suits your schedule. No worries! _TravEzy_ has got you covered. 😊

How so? Just ask _TravEzy_ to suggest a suitable time!

*Format:* +
``suggest d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR] [p/PERIOD]``

== Itinerary

It's always good to plan ahead for each day of your trip. Start planning your schedule with TravEzy Itinerary planner today and be amazed by
the increase in your day's productivity!

Each entry in your Itinerary has 6 key sections:

. Title
. Date
. Time
. Location
. Description
. Tag

The title is the name of the event. This is followed by the date and time for the execution of that event.
Lastly, the location and description are additional details of the event. Example of your events could include
hiking Mt. Everest, visiting Tokyo Disneyland, or even doing CS2103T user guide! Be amazed with how much you can actually
do within the 24 hours you are given everyday. Let's stop skiving and dive right into productivity.

=== Interface

Upon navigating to the itinerary page, this is how the itinerary page looks like:

.Itinerary Interface
image::/images/ItineraryInterface.png[]

=== Parameter

Let's start off with understanding how each parameter work first!

When inputting an event into the Itinerary, every fields are *compulsory*. However, the *location* and
*description* fields need not be specified. If you did not indicate the *location* and *description* field, the default
value "-" will be used instead.

Below are the _PREFIX_ convention that TravEzy's Itinerary will be using.

. Title: The _PREFIX_ is ``title/``. This is the crux of every event as it provides a name to the event that you
intend to do. For example:

    title/Do CS2103T developer guide

. Date: The _PREFIX_ is ``date/``. TravEzy itinerary allows dates that starts from the year 1000 up till the year 3999.

Note that the format TravEzy's Itinerary using is "ddMMyyyy". For example:


    date/30102019

. Time: The _PREFIX_ is ``time/``. Note that the format TravEzy's Itinerary is using is 24-Hour format. However,
TravEzy Itinerary will reformat the time into 12 hour format when shown on the card. For example:

    time/0000

. Location: The _PREFIX_ is ``l/``. This is the place where your event is happening at it could be a country or just
a venue. For example:

    location/Singapore      or      location/Outer Space

. Description: The _PREFIX_ is ``d/``. You can type in just a word, phrase or sentence.

    d/pen       or      d/pen pineapple apple pen

. Tag: You can select from the dropdown menu to select the importance of each event is through the various priority tagging
available. The default priority tagging is set to *Priority: None*. There is no prefix for the tagging field and you're
not allowed to edit it :(

=== Viewing help: ``help``

Unsure on how to navigate your way through the TravEzy Itinerary feature? Don't worry we got your back!

Just call for ``help`` and the help window will come to the rescue!

*A:* Install The Traveller Diary in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with during start up with the file that contains the data of your previous TTD. Alternatively, you can store it in a cloud storage it first before retrieving it and transferring it into your new computer.

*Q:* Can I change the theme of the application? I prefer to work with a night theme interface. +
*A:* Stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for this features! The TravEzy theme also aims to provide user with a UI that they are
comfortable with. Hence, we strongly believe giving users the option to personalize their theme is extremely useful
and would greatly consider adding it for the upcoming major update on TravEzy! Stay tuned for that!

*Q:* Who can view my travel posts in my TTD? +
*A:* As TTD is a single user application, it is not opened to the public, and unable to be viewed by others. Hence, it is called “diary” for a reason, which stores discrete entries reporting events that happened throughout the day. Users can however, showcase their application in front of their friends to show off their overseas trips. +

*Q:* Is it possible to connect to social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram? +

*Q:* I’m having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, TravEzy does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However,
this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and
subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online. The Traveller Diary initial uploads will only allow uploads
of pictures that are in jpg or png. Unfortunately, we do not support gif.
Do ensure that your pictures are below 25MB with the dimensions no bigger than 1920px x 1080px.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
*A:* Feel free to send an email to the developer team: mailto:thetravellerdiary@gmail.com[thetravellerdiary@gmail.com] and we will access to your queries within three working days. We also value your feedback and will use it to improve TTD. Thank you and looking forward to serving you better!

.Symbols and fonts 
[grid="rows", frame="none"]
|===

| ``m/MONTH``
| The slash and letter (or word) before the _parameter_ is a _prefix_. It is used to separate the current _parameter_ from other _parameters_.

| ``[m/MONTH]``
| Square brackets imply that the the stated _prefix_ and _parameter_ are optional. (This means less typing! 😆)

| 💡

== Itinerary

It's always good to plan ahead for each day of your trip. Start planning your schedule with TravEzy Itinerary planner today and be amazed by
the increase in your day's productivity!

Each entry in your Itinerary has 6 key sections:

. Title
. Date
. Time
. Location
. Description
. Tag

The title is the name of the event. This is followed by the date and time for the execution of that event.
Lastly, the location and description are additional details of the event. Example of your events could include
hiking Mt. Everest, visiting Tokyo Disneyland, or even doing CS2103T user guide! Be amazed with how much you can actually
do within the 24 hours you are given everyday. Let's stop skiving and dive right into productivity.

=== Interface

Upon navigating to the itinerary page, this is how the itinerary page looks like:

.Itinerary Interface
image::/images/ItineraryInterface.png[]

=== Parameter

Let's start off with understanding how each parameter work first!

When inputting an event into the Itinerary, every fields are *compulsory*. However, the *location* and
*description* fields need not be specified. If you did not indicate the *location* and *description* field, the default
value "-" will be used instead.

Below are the _PREFIX_ convention that TravEzy's Itinerary will be using.

. Title: The _PREFIX_ is ``title/``. This is the crux of every event as it provides a name to the event that you
intend to do. For example:

. Time: The _PREFIX_ is ``time/``. Note that the format TravEzy's Itinerary is using is 24-Hour format. However,
TravEzy Itinerary will reformat the time into 12 hour format when shown on the card. For example:

    time/0000

. Location: The _PREFIX_ is ``l/``. This is the place where your event is happening at it could be a country or just
a venue. For example:

    location/Singapore      or      location/Outer Space

. Description: The _PREFIX_ is ``d/``. You can type in just a word, phrase or sentence.

    d/pen       or      d/pen pineapple apple pen

. Tag: You can select from the dropdown menu to select the importance of each event is through the various priority tagging
available. The default priority tagging is set to *Priority: None*. There is no prefix for the tagging field and you're
not allowed to edit it :(

. _Memory_ -> Saw so may beautiful fish!

In the Diary, you will be able to add, delete, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special tasks that you can do with your diary.

*A:* Locate The Traveller Diary folder in your local drive and compact it into a zip file before uploading it onto a cloud storage online.

*Q:* How do I transfer my data onto another computer? +
*A:* Install The Traveller Diary in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with during start up with the file that contains the data of your previous TTD. Alternatively, you can store it in a cloud storage it first before retrieving it and transferring it into your new computer.

*Q:* Can I change the theme of the application? I prefer to work with a night theme interface. +
*A:* Stay tuned for TravEzy v2.0 for this features! The TravEzy theme also aims to provide user with a UI that they are
comfortable with. Hence, we strongly believe giving users the option to personalize their theme is extremely useful
and would greatly consider adding it for the upcoming major update on TravEzy! Stay tuned for that!

*Q:* Who can view my travel posts in my TTD? +
*A:* As TTD is a single user application, it is not opened to the public, and unable to be viewed by others. Hence, it is called “diary” for a reason, which stores discrete entries reporting events that happened throughout the day. Users can however, showcase their application in front of their friends to show off their overseas trips. +

*Q:* Is it possible to connect to social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram? +
*A:* Currently, it is not possible to connect to social media using TTD. However, we will consider implementing this feature in the future! Stay tuned for that! 😉

*Q:* Is there any in-app purchase for this application? +
*A:* NO there isn’t. TTD is created from a non-profit organization and we are not here to milk any of your gold coins! It is absolutely free! It cost nothing, zilch, nada, 零, nil, kosong. So what are you waiting for get TTD today!

*Q:* I’m having difficulties uploading the pictures onto the travel diary. +
*A:* At the moment, TravEzy does not have any feature where it allows the user to store their travel photos. However,
this will definitely be implemented in v2.0. We intend for the pictures to be stored in the user's local drive and
subsequently in a cloud database which is stored online. The Traveller Diary initial uploads will only allow uploads
of pictures that are in jpg or png. Unfortunately, we do not support gif.
Do ensure that your pictures are below 25MB with the dimensions no bigger than 1920px x 1080px.

*Q:* Who can I contact should there be a bug or feedback that I would like to share? +
*A:* Feel free to send an email to the developer team: mailto:thetravellerdiary@gmail.com[thetravellerdiary@gmail.com] and we will access to your queries within three working days. We also value your feedback and will use it to improve TTD. Thank you and looking forward to serving you better!
