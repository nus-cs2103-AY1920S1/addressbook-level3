    "description": "Advanced mass spectrometric methods, and scanning probe microscopies form an important group of advanced analytical techniques widely used for research & development, and also for process/product control in advanced manufacturing industries. Microfluidics & labchip techniques, in particular, are increasingly used for biochemical assays in biomedical devices. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of these techniques, and receive in-depth training in selected advanced analytical techniques, including advanced mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).",
