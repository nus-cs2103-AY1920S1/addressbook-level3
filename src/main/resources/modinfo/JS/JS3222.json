    "description": "With the ongoing stagnation of the Japanese economy in the 1990s, the very Japanese management which has been hailed in the past as a cornerstone of Japan's economic success has today become an issue of much debate. This module takes up this debate with an emphasis on the core area of Japanese management, the management of human resources. After outlining the features of management in Japan the module critically assesses these features over time and from different perspectives. Besides targeting students interested in Japan the module also welcomes students that are interested in critically discussing national differences in management systems in general.",
