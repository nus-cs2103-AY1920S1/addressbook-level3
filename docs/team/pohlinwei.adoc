= Poh Lin Wei's Project Portfolio

This portfolio highlights my contributions to the development of _TravEzy_, an all-in-one application which helps student 
travellers to easily plan their trips, manage their expenses and record their favourite moments.

== Introduction

This section explains how _TravEzy_ came to life and highlights the main features that it offers.

=== About the Project _TravEzy_

_TravEzy_ is an application developed by my team of five during our software engineering module (CS2103T), 
and is morphed from  https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[this address book application]. 

.To fulfil the requirements of the module, we had to ensure that _TravEzy_ ...
- uses https://www.defit.org/?s=desktop+application[command line interface (CLI)] as the primary mode of input 
(this means that users of the application should be able to use most functionalities by typing in commands)
- is a https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/41158/desktop-application[desktop application] (this implies 
that users should be able to use this application on their computers, even without a web browser)

We chose to develop _TravEzy_ because we discovered that several avid student travellers at our university 
(National University of Singapore) would love to have an application that brings together the functionalities 
of their favourite travel-related applications. This would give them easy access to the features that they enjoy most.

So how did my team and I achieve the above goal with _TravEzy_?

=== _TravEzy_'s Main Features

_TravEzy_ brings together essential features of popular travel-related applications: it is a one-stop solution 
that makes it easier for travellers to *plan their trips*, *manage their expenses* and *record their memorable moments*. 

The main features of our application are the *calendar*, *itinerary*, *address book*, *financial tracker* and *diary*.

== Summary of Contributions

This section provides an overview of my contributions to this project. As I was primarily responsible for implementing the calendar feature, this section will mainly focus on my contributions to this feature.

=== Major Highlights of the Calendar

==== Design

To enable users to better visualise their schedule for the month and plan their trips accordingly, I designed the calendar user interface as follows:

.Calendar interface
image::../images/calendarScreenshots/calendarInterface.png[Calendar interface,width=700]

{empty}

Whenever users add a new type of event (a _commitment_, _trip_, _school break_ or _holiday_) to a particular day, it will be reflected on the calendar as a new _label_. These _labels_ are also colour coded (as shown in figure 2) so that users can easily identify the types of event they have for the day.

==== Suggestion Functionality 

Finding a suitable time to travel can be especially difficult for NUS (National University of Singapore) students who have a packed schedule. Thus, I decided to implement a suggestion functionality that recommends the users suitable periods to travel. This is done by comparing their _school break_ and _holiday_ schedule with their _commitments_ and _trips_ schedule.

With this feature, users no longer have to manually look for free blocks. Instead, they just need to use the command ``suggest``.

==== Check Availability Functionality

Determining whether it is possible to travel at a specific period of time can be a hassle for users. Hence, I chose to implement a check availability functionality that makes this task simpler. 

Instead of having to switch to the relevant month view to determine their availability, users simply need to use the command ``check``. This can be especially helpful when users are interested in multiple trips but are unsure of whether they will be available to go for them. 

=== Other Highlights

In addition to the above, I enhanced a few basic functionalities as follows:

=== Other contributions

.In addition to the above, I also...
-	implemented the common command ``goto``. This enables the user to easily navigate from one feature to another without having to open multiple windows. (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T17-2/main/pull/32[#32], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T17-2/main/pull/37[#37])

== Contributions to User Guide 

This section provides a sample of the contributions I have made to the user guide. Specifically, the instructions for using ``check`` and ``suggest``.

=== Checking your availability for a trip: ``check``

Do you need to find out whether you are available to go for a trip? You can get _TravEzy_ to find that out for you (i.e. when you happen to have a _school break_/_holiday_ *and* do not have any _commitment_/_trip_).

Let's find out how!

*Format:* +
``check d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To check whether you are available on 9 December 2019,

    check d/9 m/Dec y/2019

* To check whether you are available from 9 to 20 December 2019,

    check d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019

****

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``check d/9 m/Dec y/2019`` in the _command box_ and press _Enter_. +

image::../images/calendarScreenshots/check1.png[Check command,width=600]

Step 2. The _month and year panel_ and _month view panel_ will change to show you your schedule for this December.

Step 3. The _result box_ will display a message to indicate whether you are available to travel during the specified time. If you happen to be free (like in this case), you may start booking your trip! ðŸ˜€ +

=== Suggesting a suitable time for a trip: ``suggest``

The end of the semester is near. It is time to look for some cheap flightsðŸ›«! However, before deciding which flight to book, you need to find out when you can travel. Need some help with that? No worries! _TravEzy_ has got you covered. ðŸ˜Š

How so? Just ask _TravEzy_ to suggest a suitable time!

*Format:* +
``suggest d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR] [p/PERIOD]``

*Examples:*
****
* To find out when you can travel between 9 and 20 December 2019,

    suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019

* To find out when you can travel for at least 5 days between 9 and 20 December 2019,

    suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019 p/5

****

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019`` in the _command box_ and press _Enter_. +

image::../images/calendarScreenshots/suggest1.png[Suggest command,width=600]

Step 2. The _month and year panel_ and _month view panel_ will change to show you your schedule for this December.

Step 3. The _result box_ will display a message to indicate when you are able to travel during the specified time. +

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

This section provides the contributions I have made to the developer guide.

=== Calendar

The calendar feature in _TravEzy_ allows users to easily plan when to travel. In this section, we will discuss how the calendar is designed and how the _add an event_ feature is implemented.

==== Calendar Model

This section discusses some design details of the calendar model.

The following diagram illustrates the class diagram of the most important part of the calendar model. Specifically, it focuses on the https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T17-2/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/calendar/model/event[``Event`` component].

image::../images/CalendarClassDiagram.png[Calendar model class diagram]

As shown above, the ``Calendar`` instance interacts with the ``EventManager`` by querying it. With the help of ``EventManger``, the ``Calendar`` instance does not need to deal with "lower-level" concerns (for instance, how ``Event``s are managed internally). 

Every ``EventManager`` can access ``Event``s that have been added. These ``Event``s can be ``Commitment``, ``Trip``, ``SchoolBreak`` or ``Holiday`` instances. If other instances need a read-only access to ``EventManager``, they can obtain it using the observer ``EventViewer`` which is implemented by ``EventManager``. 

In addition, every ``EventManager`` depends on ``EventQuery`` to perform queries. 

More information about this package is provided below.

*What is an ``Event``?*

* represents the event specified by the user: it is made up of the relevant ``Name``, ``EventType`` and ``Date`` (which is found in the ``Date`` package) instances

*What is an ``EventQuery``?*

* similar to an ``Event`` but is only made up of ``Date``
* is used to query the ``IntervalSearchTree`` (from the ``Util`` package) to obtain events that are relevant to the user's request more efficiently.

*How do classes in ``Util`` interact with those from ``Event``?*

* ``Util`` contains important classes and interfaces like ``DateUtil``, ``IntervalSearchTree`` and ``Interval``
* ``DateUtil`` helps ``EventManager`` to deal with manipulation of ``Date``-related operations
* ``IntervalSearchTree`` makes certain user-requested operations more efficient computationally. However, to facilitate the use of ``IntervalSearchTree``, ``Event`` and ``EventType`` need to inherit from ``Interval``. 

To find out how ``Calendar``, ``EventManager`` and ``IntervalSearchTree`` described above interact, consider the following sequence diagram. It describes how these classes work together when the user tries to add a holiday, which is represented by ``event`` (a ``Holiday`` instance) in the diagram below. 

image::../images/CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[Calendar model sequence diagram]

==== Add An Event Feature

This section provides some details about how the _add an event_ feature is implemented.

The following diagram illustrates the course of action(s) that is(are) possibly taken when a user tries to add a new trip to his/her calendar.

image::../images/CalendarActivityDiagram.png[Calendar activity diagram]

From the diagram, it can be seen that there are three major reasons that can interrupt the user request:

* the user entered an invalid input (for instance, by typing an invalid date)
* the user tried to add a duplicate event 
* the user tried to add an event that may result in conflicts in his/her schedule

==== Design Considerations

This section details a few design considerations I made before deciding how I would like to implement the functionalities of this calendar.

.Design considerations for calendar
[grid="rows", frame="none"]
|===
| Aspect | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2

| Data structure to support ``suggest`` and ``check`` commands
a|The calendar simply stores all events in a list.

* Pros: Easy to implement
* Cons: Possibly slower performance, especially when users have many events in their calendars
a|The calendar stores the events in an interval search tree.

* Pros: On average, ``suggest`` and ``check`` commands can be performed more quickly, especially when there are many events in the calendar. In turn, this can improve user experience.
* Cons: Implementation of interval search tree is tedious.
* I chose this option because performance efficiency is essential if TravEzy is to scale. Furthermore, I can use the interval search tree to implement enhancements for ``add`` and ``delete`` commands more easily. 


| Required date format for user input
a|The usual date format like dd/mm/yyyy (for example, 12/05/2019 to specify 12 May 2019).

* Pros: Easy to implement. It can be intuitive for users since this date format is common.
* Cons: Very restrictive and not everyone uses the above format (for instance, in some countries, people specify date using the mm/dd/yyyy format).

a|Allow users to specify day, month and year in whichever order they want.

* Pros: More flexible and less restrictive for users.
* Cons: If caution is not taken, bugs can arise quite easily.
* I chose this implementation because it allows users to specify dates in the format which they are most familiar with.
