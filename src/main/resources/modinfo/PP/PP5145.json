Good understanding of the political economy embedded in policy and administrative reforms are thus essential. This course examines the political-economic dynamics embedded in the reform process from various institutional perspectives. It is a master\u2013level course designed for practitioners in the field of public administration and public policy. It discusses strategies for achieving and enhancing reform outcomes. Studies and practices from different policies written by both academics and practitioners will be drawn on as reading materials and learning resources for the class.",
