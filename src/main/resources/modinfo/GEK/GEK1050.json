    "description": "Main aim of this module is to widen the capacity for understanding the relations of space and health. Upon completion students will be able to recognize how space influences the wellbeing and efficiently define qualities and deficiencies of this relation. They will critically evaluate real life examples and develop conceptual proposals for creative improvements. Issues like function, form, light, noise, wayfinding, color and symbols, environment, and many more are discussed from social, psychological, technical, cultural and environmental perspective. Lectures are combined with on site exercises and critical enquiry on real problems.",
