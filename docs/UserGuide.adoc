== Introduction


Athletick is a team management desktop application for captains and coaches of timing-based sports teams. Athletick helps you to handle your administrative tasks so that you can focus on what you love doing: leading and motivating your team.

Athletick supports *storing of your team members' personal details, attendance tracking and performance recording*. If you are a fast typist, you'll love Athletick's *Command Line Interface* (CLI) which will get your team management tasks done faster than ever before!

//tag::undoredo[]

==== Undoing a previous command : `undo`

This command restores Athletick to the state before the previous command was executed.

[NOTE]
====
Take note that the `undo` feature only applies to undoable commands.
Undoable commands include: `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `training`, `event` and `performance`.

The `undo` command will not be able to undo non-undoable commands.
Let’s say you have executed a `list` command to list out all the athletes information in Athletick.
If you were to execute the `undo` command now, the `undo` command will fail because `list` is not an undoable command,
and that no undoable commands were executed before this.

The `undo` command will reverse the latest command that can be undone.
Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command, followed by the `list` command.
Since `list` command is not an undoable command, if you were to execute `undo`
command now, you will thus reverse the `delete` command.

The `undo` command reverses previous commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say you have executed the `edit` command, followed by the `delete` command. If you were
to execute `undo` command now, you will reverse the `delete` command. Executing `undo` again
will then reverse the `edit` command.
====

Let’s say you have accidentally deleted an athlete’s contact (Mohamad Ali) from your list.
Instead of having to re-enter Mohamad Ali’s contact information all over again,
you can easily restore all of Mohamad Ali’s details by executing the command `undo` to
undo the `delete` command that you have just entered.

*What you should do*

With Mohamad Ali's contact information deleted, the current list has 7 people. Type `undo` into the command box, and
press Enter to execute it.

Format : `undo`

image::Undo0.png[width="450"]

*What you should see*

The result box will display a success message and you can check that
Mohamad Ali’s contact information is visible in the list again!

==== Redoing an `undo` command : `redo`

This command reverses the most recent `undo` command.

[NOTE]
====
The `redo` command can only be executed immediately after an `undo` command.
Let’s say that you have executed the `undo` command to undo a previous command that you have previously executed.
You then execute the `list` command to view your list.
Executing the `redo` command now will fail because your previous command was not an `undo` command.

The `redo` command reverses previous `undo` commands in reverse chronological order.
Let’s say that you have executed the `clear` command, followed by the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command now will reverse the `add` command.
Executing the `undo` command again will reverse the `clear` command as well.
Following this, executing the `redo` command will reverse the most recent `undo` command and re-execute the `clear`
command.
Executing the `redo` command again will reverse the second most recent `undo` command and re-execute the `add` command.
====

Let’s say you have executed the `delete` command to delete Mohamad Ali from your list.
You may undo this action and restore Mohamad Ali’s information by executing the `undo` command.



Then, if you decide that you want the contact to remain deleted after all,
you may very quickly do so by executing the `redo` command to reverse the `undo` command that you had just executed.

*What you should do*

With Mohamad Ali's contact information, the current list has 8 people. Type `redo` into the command box, and press
Enter to execute it.

Format : `redo`

image::Redo0.png[width="450"]
*What you should see*

The result box will display a success message.
Furthermore, the list now only has 7 people and Mohamad Ali is once again gone from the list!
