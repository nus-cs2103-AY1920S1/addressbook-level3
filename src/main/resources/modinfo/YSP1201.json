    "description": "The Yale-NUS Summer Institute in Leadership and Global Strategy has been designed to offer Yale-NUS students the chance to consider pressing global issues and to offer a way of thinking or framework to address them.  Adapted from Yale\u2019s iconic Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy, the structure of this summer seminar will introduce students to the theory and practice of grand strategy from different analytic perspectives.  With a focus on the environment, public health and the global movement of peoples, we will consider how to frame priorities to address these issues.",
