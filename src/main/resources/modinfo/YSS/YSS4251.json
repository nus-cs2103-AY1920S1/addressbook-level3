    "description": "The automation economy is changing how we live and work. This course applies an interdisciplinary lens to explore the ways in societies have organized themselves relative to technology in the past, and what changes are currently taking place. Students will learn about the wave of technology-driven descriptions occurring on a global scale, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and virtual reality. The Fourth Industrial Revolution will be explored as a tool to enable students to critique theories of technological change, and construct their own narratives of change in case study analysis. Critical thinking will be demonstrated through a written empirical research paper assignment.",
