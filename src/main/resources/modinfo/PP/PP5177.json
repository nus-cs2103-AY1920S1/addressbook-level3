    "description": "Focuses on the concept of progressive cities to assess cities in Asia. The class will form teams to cover four dimensions of the urban contribution to human flourishing: inclusion in public life and decisionmaking; distributive justice; conviviality of social life; and nurturing of the natural environment. Through a combination of lectures and workshop sessions, concepts will be deepened and evidence will be gathered about a select number of candidate progressive cities in Asia. In addition to individual reports, we will attempt to create a progressive city index to compare with liveable city, world city and other city performance measures.",
