== PROJECT: Xpire

== Overview

My team and I were tasked to morph an existing Desktop application called AddressBook3 for our Software Engineering Team Project (Module Code: CS2103T). Our team has chosen to morph the application into an Expiry Date Tracker named Xpire that targets students living in residences and halls. Our application allows users to track expiry dates of items and be reminded when they are about to expire. Examples of items that can be tracked include perishable items such as Milk, Bread, Fruits or even non-perishable items such as Medicine and Passwords. Additionally, there is also a ReplenishList where users can track what items they need to replenish after it expires or has been used up.

== Xpire Interface

Currently, this is what our project, Xpire, looks like in v1.4:

== Formatting and Terms used in this Project Portfolio

`undo` - This grey highlight represents a class, a variable or method that exists in the codebase. It can also represent a command that has to be entered into the application. +
`Xpire` - This refers to the main list in the application and not the entire application. The Xpire application will be simply referred to as 'the application'. +
`ReplenishList` - This refers to the replenish list in the application. +
`current view` - This refers to the current list that the user is viewing (either the main list (`Xpire`) or the replenish list (`ReplenishList`)). +
Lightbulb icon - Refers to a tip that developers/users can follow. +
Info icon - Refers to an important note that developers/users need to know.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section details the contributions I have made to the team as well as any documentation or code I have written._
|===

* *My code on RepoSense*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Kalsyc&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[RepoSense]]

* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo previous commands or redo commands that have been entered earlier.
** Justification: This feature enhances the application by introducing Error Prevention as the user may accidentally key in a command wrongly and may want a convenient way of undoing that particular command. The redo command also provides convenience as it allows users to go back and forth in history to see the changes.
** Highlights: This feature must work with existing commands as well as future commands and also not slow down the application. A proper brainstorming of design choices must be made as the undo/redo mechanism will affect most commands and the current status of the application. The implementation was challenging as there are two lists that the application contains which is `Xpire` and `ReplenishList` and there is a need to find a way to archive the data in order to support undoing of commands. +
Also, efficiency and memory usage is a concern as we do not want to store too many archival data which may slow down the application, thus only items or views that have been changed should be noted by the mechanism and not create duplicates.
** Code contributed for this enhancement: (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2/main/pull/138[#138], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2/main/pull/181[#181])

* *Major enhancement*: added a *tagging command that allows users to tag items in the application*
** What it does: allows the user to tag items so that they are able to search it up or group items together easily.
** Justification: This feature improves the application by allowing users the freedom to categorise their items and organise them properly. This is important as the application may contain many items at any time and there should be a convenient way of organising them into separate groups.
** Highlights: This enhancement works well with the two existing lists, `Xpire` and `ReplenishList`. Some thought must be given to parsing and storing tags in items as our team has decided on a limit of the amount of tags each item can have as well as a limit on how long the tag should be. The implementation was difficult when trying to apply defensive programmming as we do not want tags to be accidentally deleted away or have been duplicated. +
Furthermore, tag must support deletion and stackable commands as our application so that the user can add or delete tags easily in the current view.
** Code contributed for this enhancement: (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2/main/pull/17[#17])

* *Minor enhancement*: created a history manager which stores commands and user input for feedback as well as for use in retrieving previous user inputs.
** Code contributed for this enhancement: (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2/main/pull/197[#197])

* *Minor enhancement*: implemented a show all tags function that allows users to see all the tags that are present in the current view.
** Code contributed for this enhancement: (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-2/main/pull/83[#83])
