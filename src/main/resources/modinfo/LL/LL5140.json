    "description": "The Law of the Sea governs the conduct of States in the oceans. Given that the oceans covers five-seventh of the world\u2019s surface, it is a critical component of international law. It is also relevant for Singapore due to its extensive maritime interests. This course will examine the theoretical underpinnings and the practical implementation of Law of the Sea with the aim of examining how it addresses the ever-increasing challenges in the regulation of the oceans. The course will draw on a wide range of case studies from around the world, with a particular emphasis on Asia.",
