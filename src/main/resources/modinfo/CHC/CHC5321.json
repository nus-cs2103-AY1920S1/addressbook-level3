    "description": "This is a linguistic course which focuses on Chinese interpretations of what is aesthetically beautiful. To do so, we will examine verbal/written accounts describing or referring to sonic (e.g. musical) and visual (e.g. artistic) representations, analysing cultural meanings behind words and phrases that crop up in these accounts. The premise is that, whereas sonic and visual representations themselves do not hold any meaning and therefore do not lend themselves readily to rigorous linguistic analyses, words or phrases describing or referring to these representations do.",
