    "description": "This course aims to provide a unique enriching experiential learning opportunity to gain a broader understanding and insight into global logistics and supply chains. It will be delivered via an intensive two-week summer school programme at an international partner university, such as Kuhne Logistics University or the Logistikum at University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. Adopting a case-based learning approach, students will experience challenging real business cases and workshops designed to combine sophisticated theory with hands-on practical experience in industry. Students will be exposed to educational content with high practical industrial relevance and innovative solutions for companies with state-of-the-art expertise. The cases will follow the logic and lines of a global supply chain: starting with supplier evaluation, to usage of multimodal transport, cold chain logistics, set-up of SCM function in a company from scratch down to customer delivery, customer segmentation, and ending with the challenges of e-commerce and last-mile delivery.",
