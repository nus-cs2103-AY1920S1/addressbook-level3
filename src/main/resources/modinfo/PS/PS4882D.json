    "description": "This seminar examines the causes and consequences of transnational migration, a complex and little understood aspect of globalisation. How have governments and international organizations responded to mass population movements? How has transnational migration been treated as a political, economic, security, and human rights issue? What are the gender aspects of migration? We will explore these topics through historical and contemporary perspectives on migrants and refugees. We will consider a wide range of sending and receiving countries, focusing on states and movements in Southeast Asia.",
