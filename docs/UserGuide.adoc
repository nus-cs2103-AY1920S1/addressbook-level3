== Introduction

This CS2103/T Revision Tool (RT) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for storing their personally
customised question banks*. More importantly, RT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, RT can get your revision done faster than traditional quiz
GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

[NOTE]
RT is initially designed with the intention to help CS2103/T students who do not like to use Luminus quizzes
for their revision. However, it can also be used for other modules or other revision purposes, for students who
generally prefer a CLI and GUI that is different from what Luminus or other existing quiz apps have to offer.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Ensure that you have the latest version of JavaFX installed in your Computer. (Previous versions of JavaFX may cause
bugs related to displaying pop ups. more info about this bug can be found at this link:{javaFxBugURL}/link[link])
.  Download the latest RT link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your `*question bank*`.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. The image below shows the app in configuration mode.

* *`list`* : lists questions of all categories and difficulties for the user to view.
* **`add `**`type/mcq q/According to the textbook, which kind of project is more difficult? x/Greenfield x/Brownfield y/None
of the above x/Padifield diff/1 cat/Introduction` : adds an mcq question with x/ (as in a cross for "wrong") marking the wrong answers and
y/ (as in "yes") marking the correct answers. Difficulty: 1, Category: Introduction.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd question shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<ConfigurationMode>> for details of each command.

which can be used as `add type/mcq q/What the recommended user story format?`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[x/WRONG_ANSWER]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `x/Greenfield`, `x/Brownfield` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION cat/CATEGORY`, `cat/CATEGORY q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
