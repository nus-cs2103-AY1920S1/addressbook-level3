    "description": "With the onset of globalization, the study of contract law can no longer be confined to arrangements between private entities sharing the same nationality and operating in the same jurisdiction. The costliest and most complex contractual disputes involve States, State entities, or State-linked enterprises, and foreign nationals, as contracting parties. The introduction of States as permanent and powerful participants in economic life led to the emergence of a bespoke body of law \u2013 international contract law \u2013 to regulate these prominent contractual arrangements. This course is for students who have been targeted for regional and international legal practice, or who plan to gravitate towards transnational legal work in multinational corporations.",
