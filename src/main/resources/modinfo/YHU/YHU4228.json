    "description": "Examining regional and transnational oceanic frameworks, including Mediterranean Studies, Transpacific Studies, Transatlantic Studies (including the Black Atlantic) and Indian Ocean Studies, this course asks what these transoceanic perspectives offer students of literature and the arts. Oceanic frameworks allow for interdisciplinary work, and can be combined with feminist, queer, eco-critical, digital humanities and postcolonial approaches. We will also be exploring the idea of hydropoetics, the creative practice of writing about/on water, and thinking about the ocean as an artistic, cultural and creative space. Incorporating theoretical and fictional texts, this course offers students the opportunity to produce a creative final project.",
