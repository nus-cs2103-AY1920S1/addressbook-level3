== PROJECT: NurseTraverse

== Overview

NurseTraverse is a desktop application designed to help community nurses manage all the data they may need, including
visit management, appointment scheduling, and importing and exporting of patient data.
The user interacts with the app using a CLI (Command Line Interface) enhanced with an autocomplete functionality and
ability to undo and redo commands. The app has a GUI created with JavaFX and is written in Java.
NurseTraverse is built by me and 4 other students.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one or many at a time. Preceding undo commands can be
reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the
app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required detailed handling of the model
state.
** Credits: No outside code or ideas were referenced in the development of these features (beyond code that already
exists within _Address Book 3_).

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history GUI panel that displays previous commands, making it much more convenient to
use the multiple undo command.
