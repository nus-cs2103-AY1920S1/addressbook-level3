==== Adding an order: `-add_order`
This command allows you to add a new order to the database to be processed. The deliveryman to deliver the order will be allocated
automatically based on the internal algorithms.

Format: `-add_order c/CUSTOMER r/RESTAURANT f/FOOD... q/QUANTITY...`

Example: `-add_order c/AlexYeoh r/KFC f/Chicken Nuggets q/100`

[start]
.Example use case

. Type the command statement from the example above into the program and press *Enter* to execute it.

image::userguide\AddOrder1.png[width="480"]

[start=2]
. If you are successful, the result box displays the message:
`_"New order added:  Order Name: Order 7 Customer: AlexYeoh Restaurant: KFC Deliveryman: Donald Trump Food: Chicken Nuggets x100  Completed delivery: false"._`

image::userguide\AddOrder2.png[width="480"]

[start=3]
. The order list shows the newly added order.

image::userguide\AddOrder3.png[width="480"]

[NOTE]
====

* A valid customer `c/CUSTOMER`, restaurant `r/RESTAURANT` and restaurant menu item `f/FOOD` must be provided and
exists currently in the database.

* The quantity of food `q/QUANTITY` to be delivered must be provided and be greater than 0.
====

[TIP]
====

* Fill in the restaurant `r/RESTAURANT` before entering the restaurant menu item `f/FOOD` for the autocompletion feature to load the list of that restaurant's menu in a drop down box for you.

==== Editing an order: `-edit_order`
This command enables you to edit an order. The order to edit will have to be specified by its order name when you are entering the command.

You can change:

* The customer `c/CUSTOMER` who made the order

* The restaurant `r/RESTAURANT` which the order was made from

* The food `f/FOOD` ordered as well as its quantity `q/QUANTITY`

Format: `-edit_order n/ORDERNAME [c/CUSTOMER] [r/RESTAURANT] [f/FOOD]... [q/QUANTITY]...`

Example: `-edit_order n/Order 2 c/David`

[start]
.Example use case

. Type the command statement from the example above into the program and press *Enter* to execute it.

image::userguide\EditOrder1.png[width="480"]

[start=2]
. If you are successful, the result box displays the message:
`_"Successful edition of order:  Order Name: Order 2 Customer: David Restaurant: Prata House Deliveryman: Donald Trump Food: Curry Waterfall x1 Plain Prata x2 Cheese Prata x4 Prata Bomb x10  Completed delivery: false"._`

image::userguide\EditOrder2.png[width="480"]

[start=3]
. The order list shows the updated order.

image::userguide\EditOrder3.png[width="480"]

[NOTE]
====

* The order name `n/ORDERNAME` must exist in the order list.

* A customer `c/CUSTOMER`, restaurant `r/RESTAURANT` or restaurant menu item `f/FOOD` provided must be valid and exists currently in the database.

* Optional items with '[]' tags may be ommitted e.g. `[r/RESTAURANT]`. However at least 1 tag has to be present for the order to be edited.
====

[TIP]
====

* Fill in the restaurant `r/RESTAURANT` before entering the restaurant menu item `f/FOOD` for the autocompletion feature to load the list of that restaurant's menu in a drop down box for you.

=== Autocomplete commands feature

This is a feature which allows you to view all available commands matching the input keyword or letters, eliminating the need to memorize the commands or leave a browser tab open with the User Guide of this application.

==== Implementation

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by the `[blue]#KeyListener#` and a `[blue]#Trie#`, a tree-like abstract data type (ADT).
The `[blue]#KeyListener#` passes the current input text in the input command box to the `[blue]#TrieManager#` via `[blue]#LogicManager#getAutoCompleteResults()#`.
The `[blue]#TrieManager#` calls `[blue]#Trie#autoCompleteCommandWord()#` and a sorted list of matching commands is passed back to the `[blue]#CommandBox#` and is displayed on the `[blue]#Ui#` via a dropdown box below the user input command box.

The underlying data structure used is a directed graph with the `[blue]#Trie#` as a node and `[blue]#HashMap<Character, Trie>#` to represent all outgoing edges.
The keys in the `[blue]#HashMap#` are `[blue]#Characters#` in the command words while the values are the `[blue]#Tries#` containing the subsequent `[blue]#Characters#` in the command words.
Each `[blue]#Trie#` contains a `[blue]#List<String>#` of command words, which is returned when `[blue]#Trie#autoCompleteCommandWord()#` is called.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: You launch the application. The `[blue]#TrieManager#` initializes the respective `[blue]#Tries#` with their context-specific command words using `[blue]#Trie#insertCommand()#`.
The `[blue]#Trie#` adds each `[blue]#Character#` of the input `[blue]#String#` and new `[blue]#Tries#` into the `[blue]#HashMap<Character, Trie>#`, as well as the command word into the `[blue]#List<String>#`, recursively as illustrated by the activity diagram below.

image::AutoCompleteActivityDiagram.png[height="100"]

Step 2: You want to add an order to the database, however are uncertain how to spell the command and type in `_order_`.
The `[blue]#KeyListener#` passes the `[blue]#String#` in the `[blue]#CommandBox#` to the `[blue]#Trie#` via the `[blue]#LogicManager#` and `[blue]#TrieManager#`.
The trie searches for relevant commands and pass them as a list back to the `[blue]#CommandBox#` via `[blue]#Trie#getAutoCompleteCommandWord()#`, `[blue]#Trie#search()#` and `[blue]#Trie#getAllCommandWords()#`.
The `[blue]#Ui#` displays the relevant results in a dropdown box below the user input command box.

Step 3: You can now complete the command you want by entering the relevant command shown in the dropdown box.

==== Design Considerations

Below are a few design considerations of the autocomplete commands feature.

===== Aspect: How autocomplete executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `[blue]#KeyListener#` to record and handle user inputs in the user input command box before they are entered.
** Pros: Aesthetically pleasing, allows for on-the-fly display of results.
** Cons: Laborious to implement, especially in terms of debugging and troubleshooting. It may also break Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles if not implemented properly.
* **Alternative 2:** Handle user input only when the command is entered, utilizing the `[blue]#Parser#` to  handle user inputs and pass it to the `[blue]#Trie#` to be evaluated.
** Pros: Adheres to current flow of command executions, will not break any OOP principles.
** Cons: Tedious for the user, as the user will have to retype the whole command again. Furthermore, it does not look aesthetically pleasing.

Alternative 1 was selected, as it is more user friendly, and leaves a better impression onto users compared to alternative 2.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the autocomplete commands feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `[blue]#Trie#` to store `[blue]#Characters#` of commands as keys.
** Pros: Efficient and rapid searching, retrieving and displaying of results due to the tree-like ADT.
** Cons: Tedious to implement, as `[blue]#Tries#` are not currently implemented in Java.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a list to store all current commands.
** Pros: Easy to implement as lists are already available in Java.
** Cons: Inefficient and slow searching, because of the need to iterate through the entire list of commands while calling `.substring()` and `.contains()` methods.

Alternative 1 was selected, as it allows for faster searching and listing of relevant commands compared to alternative 2.
