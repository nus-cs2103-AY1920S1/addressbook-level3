We are a team of hardworking and studious students who want only the best-quality software for our learning. And we’re always on the go to achieve that perfect 5.0. That’s why we created _KeyboardFlashCards_: a highly efficient flashcard manager catered to the fastest typists, saving time for the optimal learning experience.
****
* This is a desktop Flashcard management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is developed mainly to assist students in learning and preparing for examinations.
