== Sample Data

[TIP]
The NJoy Assistant starts with some data as examples. Upon the first startup, the *students*, *questions*,
*events* and *notes* storage are loaded with sample data. The user should clear these if they are not of importance,
as they merely serve as examples.

The following steps provide an example of how to clear the sample user data for questions. The same steps can
be applied to clear the storage for students, events and notes albeit slight <<Differences, `differences`>>.

*Step 1.* To see the list of questions, type in the following command: `question list`. The sample question is
circled in purple. +

.Question List
image::QuestionListSample.jpg[]

{nbsp} +
*Step 2.* To delete the sample question, type in the following command: `question delete 1`. This deletes the
first question in the question list, which in this case is the sample question! +
{nbsp} +
After which, you should see the message circled in red indicating the success of the deletion. +

.Question Delete
image::QuestionDeleteSample.jpg[]

{nbsp} +
*Step 3.* You're already done! To confirm that the question has been deleted, once again type in the following
command: `question list`. You should see that there are no more sample questions! +

.Blank Question List

on the right hand side of the User Interface. +

. *Events*: The steps for deletion are the same as for the sample question, except that to view the event, a
different command: `event view` has to be keyed into the command line.

=== Quizzes ​-​ `quiz`

After taking the effort to record different questions, a teacher might be wondering what other features could the NJoy Teaching
Assistant actually provide? What better way to make use of your predefined questions to create quizzes for homework, revision
or even assignments?

[NOTE]
Unfortunately, since majority of the quiz commands rely on question and quiz question indexes, it is entirely up to the user
to ensure the correct indexes of the questions or quiz questions have been entered.

You may refer to <<Feature-Question-Add, creating a question>> for examples on how to add questions and <<Feature-Question-List, listing the questions>> on how to view the current list of questions in the databank.

[NOTE]
For the following examples, we will be operating under the assumption that these sample
questions are in the question bank.

[[Feature-Event-Index]]
==== Indexing a event

Gets the index a event based on its event name. If more than one event has the same name, the command will return the index and details of all of them.
Else if the event name is not found, it shows the event which has the most similar event name.

[NOTE]
Users should always run this command before edit or delete event commands. As the index of a event CAN change while the application is running.
For example, deleting another event will affect the index of other events.

Format: `event indexOf/...`

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `indexOf/` - Name of the event

Examples:

* `event indexOf/CS2103T Lecture` +
Returns the index and details of the CS2103T Lecture in the calendar.

'''

==== Editing a event

Edit a event currently stored. All fields are *optional*. +
Format: `event [INDEX] eventName/... startDateTime/... endDateTime/... recur/... color/...`

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `[INDEX]` - The event index as defined by the <<Feature-Event-Index, index>>  command.
. `eventName` - Name of the event
. `startDateTime` - The start date and time of the event
. `endDateTime` - The end date and time of the event
. `recur` - Recurrence of the event. Either none, daily or weekly.

Edits the event name of the event with index 2 to _'CS2101 Lecture'_.

'''

==== Deleting a event

Delete a event from the calendar. +
Format: `event delete [INDEX]`

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `[INDEX]` - The event index as defined by the <<Feature-Event-Index, index>> command.

[NOTE]
Deleting a event which is recurring (daily or weeekly) will delete all instances of that event.


* `event delete 1` +
Deletes the event with index 1

'''

==== Viewing all events

Show all your events in the calendar. All fields are optional +
Format: `event view scheduleMode/... targetDate/...`

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `scheduleMode` - Schedule viewing mode of the calendar. Either weekly or daily.
. `targetDate` - The target date to show for the week. If in daily mode, simply show the events in the date.
If in weekly mode, show the week which includes the specified date
[NOTE]
The target date option must be specified in the following format: yyyy-mm-dd. E.g. 2019-11-23

'''

==== Taking screenshot of schedule

Takes a screen shot of the calendar as PNG file +
Format: `event screenshot`

[NOTE]
Scroll to which portion of the calendar is to be taken, and the application will then open a separate
full screen window to maximise the content captured of the screenshot.

[NOTE]
The event schedule screenshot is stored in the printable directory which is in the same directory as the NJoy assistant.
If the directory exists beforehand, no new directory is created.
See <<Finding-Schedule-Screenshot, finding schedule screenshot>>.

[NOTE]
The screenshot will be saved based on the current settings of your event schedule.
For example if you are viewing 2019-11-23 on a weekly mode, the file name will be saved as WEEKLY_2019-11-23. NJoy will also overwrite any screenshots from the past with the same event name, to ensure that the screenshot in the printable directory is the most updated.


* Example: `event screenshot` +
Takes a screenshot of the current calendar and saves it into Printable folder.

[[Finding-Schedule-Screenshot]]
The following example demonstrates how to find the screenshot:

*Step 1.* After executing the event screenshot command, the user should
navigate to their current directory. An printable folder as shown in the image below should be created!

.Event screenshot Location
image::EventPrintableLocation.png[]

{nbsp} +
*Step 2.* The png file will be named according to your schedule settings in the format VIEWMODE_TARGETDATE.png

.Event screenshot file
image::EventScreenshotFile.png[]

{nbsp} +
*Step 3.* Now you can share your calendar screenshot with others (or yourself)!

==== Export all events

Exports stored events into a .ics file. This file type can easily be imported into Google Calendar and other
mainstream calendar applications. +
Format: `event export`

[NOTE]
The file will be exported into the exports folder with the file name nJoy_Schedule.ics. If the file already exists
it will replace it, so you know the .ics file will be your most updated version of your schedule.

[NOTE]
The file will be exported into the same directory as quiz and group exports. See <<Feature-Quiz-Export, quiz export>>,
 <<Feature-Group-Export-Export, group export>>


Example:

* `event export` +
Exports your events into the exports directory with file name nJoy_Schedule.ics

The following example demonstrates how to find the export file:

*Step 1.* After executing the event export command, the user should
navigate to their current directory. An exports folder as shown in the image below should be created!

.Event export location
image::EventExportLocation.png[]

{nbsp} +
*Step 2.* The file should be named nJoy_Schedule.ics inside the exports directory.

.Event export file

=== Notes - `notes`

==== Creating a note

Create lightweight, digital notes and reminders quickly and easily as specified. +
Format: `note note/... desc/... priority/... (optional)`

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `note` - The note title.
. `desc` - The description of the note.
. `priority(optional)` - The level of priority placed on this note. It can be of type `unmarked`, `low`, `medium` or `high`. It is by default set to unmarked if field is omitted.

[NOTE]
All non-optional fields are required and also cannot consist exclusively of whitespace characters. All leading and trailing whitespaces of the fields will be ignored.

[NOTE]
All priority fields can be in either lowercase or UPPERCASE. (e.g. `note note/sample title desc/sample desc priority/low` is the same as e.g. `note note/sample title desc/sample desc priority/LOW`).

[NOTE]
`priority` levels are distinguishable by their colour in the User Interface. `unmarked` or default notes have grey panels, while `low`, `medium` and `high` priority notes have green, yellow and red panels respectively.

[NOTE]
The notes panel is not responsive. The User Interface only supports title and description of limited length. Notes that exceed this length will be truncated. For information on how to view these notes, see the note list command.

Examples:

* *Unmarked Note*: `note note/Friday morning class 6A desc/give back prelim papers` +
Creates an unmarked note with title _'Friday morning class 6A'_ and description _'give back prelim papers'_.
* *High priority note*: `note note/Tuesday 1pm desc/Science Conference priority/high` +
Creates a high priority note with title _'Tuesday 1pm'_ and description _'Science Conference'_.


==== Editing a note

Edit a note currently stored. All fields are *optional* but at least one field has to be provided for editing. The new note should not be the same as the original one and should have a unique note title. +
Format: `note [INDEX] note/... desc/... priority/...`

[NOTE]
To change the priority of a `high`, `medium` or `low` note to the default status, the prefix `priority/` is to be followed by `unmarked`. (e.g. note 2 priority/unmarked).

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `[INDEX]` - The note index as shown in the User Interface. The topmost note has index 1, followed by 2 and so on.
. `note` - The note title.
. `desc` - The description of the note.
. `priority` - The level of priority placed on this note. It can be of type `unmarked`, `low`, `medium` or `high`.

Examples:

* `note 1 note/changed title` +
Edits the first note in the list to the title _'changed title'_.
* `note 2 desc/give speech priority/unmarked` +
Edits the description of the second note in the list to _’give speech’_ of unmarked/default priority.

'''

==== Deleting a note

Delete a note from the notes list. +
Format: `note delete [INDEX]`

. `[INDEX]` - The note index as shown in the User Interface. The topmost note has index 1, followed by 2 and so on.

Example:

* `note delete 1` +
Deletes the first note in the list.

'''

[[Feature-Note-List]]
==== Listing notes

Display the list of notes in the command result box. +
Format: `note list`

[NOTE]
The note is rendered on the User Interface on load. However, note lengths that exceed the size of allocated panel might have their content truncated. Using the list function is useful in this case to see the full content of the notes.

The options supported by this feature includes: +
*_-This command does not support any additional options-_*

Example:

* `note list` +
Lists the notes.

'''

[[Feature-Note-Sort]]

'''

[[Feature-Statistics]]
=== Statistics - `statistics`

==== Generating a Statistics report

Create statistics reports of student scores using excel data files. The statistics generated is based
on the calculated weighted score of the input data. +
Format: `statistics file/... print/...(optional)`

The options supported by this feature includes:

. `file` - The absolute/relative file path of the data file.
. `print(optional)` - The filename of the printable report you wish to generate.

[NOTE]
The statistics feature only supports file type in the ‘Excel’ format. Data files are to end with the _’.xlsx’_ extension.

[NOTE]
The `print` option allows the generation of a _'.png'_ file containing a snapshot of the statistics report generated. Regardless of the print specifications, a new window is opened with the statistics report.

[NOTE]
Printable statistics reports if specified are stored in the same place as where the JAR file is installed. The report can be found under a newly created `printable` directory. If the directory exists beforehand, no new directory is created.

[NOTE]
Filenames without _`.png`_ extension will automatically have the extension appended to the end of the file name.

[NOTE]
If the file name specified already exists in the printable directory, it will overwrite the existing file.

Examples:

* *View Statistics Report (without saving)*: `statistics file/C:\Users\SampleUser\Desktop\6B Prelim Scores.xlsx` +
Shows the statistics report for excel file named _’6B Prelim Scores’_.

* *View and Save Statistics Report*: `statistics file/C:\Users\SampleUser\Desktop\6B Prelim Scores.xlsx print/6B Prelim Performance Report` +
Shows the statistics report for excel file named _’6B Prelim Scores’_. It also saves an image file containing a snapshot of the statistics report in the _’printable’_ directory with name _’6B Prelim Performance Report’_.

*Data File Specifications*

The data file needs to be specified in the following format to ensure that the statistics report is successfully generated. +

[NOTE]
Failure to adhere to the following specifications might result in either the excel file being rejected or erroneous statistics.
If the report is generated, it might be correct but the behavior is not guaranteed should the specifications mentioned below be violated or overlooked.

* *Entries start at cell A1 with the cell `Students`, regardless of whether there is score data.*
* *First row begins with the cell `Students`, followed by their names. (e.g. row 1 of 4 cells having `Students`, `Jason`, `Mike` and `Peter`)*
* *First column states the different subjects starting from the second topmost cell. (e.g column 1 of 4 cells having `Students`, `Math`, `Science` and `English`.)*
* *There is at least one student.*
* *There is at least one subject.*
* *All student names have unique identifiers. (e.g. two students named Jason could be identified as `Jason 1` and `Jason 2`)*
* *All subject names have unique identifiers. (e.g. two subjects named Math could be identified as `Advanced Math` and `Elementary Math`)*
* *All students have a corresponding score for all subjects*
* *All scores are numeric characters (integer or decimals)*
* *There are no gaps between rows and columns.*
* *All cells within the row and column range have at least one non-whitespace character.*
* *All cells outside the row and column range are empty.*

[NOTE]
Failure to adhere to the following specifications might result in some of the statistical data generated not being useful to the user.

* *All scores should be in percentage terms. (0 ~ 100)*

[NOTE]
The general rule for the file format is to ensure all entries in the file are as compact to the top left as possible; the entries should form a rectangular shape on the top left corner of the excel sheet. The rectangle should have no empty entries while all cells outside the rectangle are empty entries.

The statistics report generated uses weighted average scores across the different subjects to perform analysis. All scores carry equal weight. The statistics generated
allow you to see some of the common descriptive statistics and their relative distributions both in terms of frequency and percentile terms.

The screenshot below illustrates a sample data set that fulfills all of the above specifications.
