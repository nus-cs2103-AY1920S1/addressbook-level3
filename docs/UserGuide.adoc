== Introduction

EatMe is a *food diary app for people who love good food*. It helps you manage places you have been to, keep track of your experience and expenditure, and even keep you up-to-date with the latest food trends and events!

EatMe comes with two different modes: *Main* and *Todo* modes. In the Main mode, you will be able to manipulate eateries that you have visited before. In the Todo mode, however, you will be able to manipulate eateries that you have yet to visit but are planning to visit in the future.

EatMe is optimized for those who like the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still maintaining the user-friendliness of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). *Interested to keep track of your favorite food places with maximum efficiency? Try EatMe today!* Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.
