    "description": "This module explores topics of international relations as they are treated in classical political thought. Topics include: nature and purpose of political order; causes of war; sovereignty and self-determination; balance of power, diplomacy, international law, family of nations, and the transformation of international political community. These topics are examined in the context of key international relations distinctions: inside/outside; universal/particular; and system/society. Particular attention will be given to identifying patterns of continuity and change that explain how these topics have been understood historically.",
