[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Typee_UML-Architecture.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

The first four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i/1`.

.Component interactions for `delete i/1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EngagementListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`
, `Tab`, `TabListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]
{empty} +

[NOTE]
The package state contains additional packages that represent state machines for each `Command`. These packages have been
omitted for brevity. +
XYZ refers to any arbitrary command. For example: +
`XYZEndState` can be `AddEndState` and `XYZCommand` can be `AddCommand`.

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InteractiveParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the engagement list data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Engagement>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the engagement list data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `com.typee.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::tab-switch[]
=== Tab Switch Feature
Tab switch feature is a type of Command that allows users to switch to respective windows for using different features in the system. +
Tab switch function is implemented in using both CLI and GUI approach; user can execute tab-switch by typing command in the input text-area or by interaction with the UI component (Button).

==== Implementation Structure

[.float_group]
[.clearfix]
---
.TabCommand Class Diagram and fetchTabInfo Activity Diagram
image::tabcmd_and_tabFetch_activity.png[width="750", float="left"]
---

1. User is required to use a `Command`; `TabCommand` in order to switch the window to another window.
* Upon first startup of the system, system will display the `EngagementList` window by default.
2. New Ui Model class `Tab` is implemented to contain the respective fxml controller classes in a OOP manner.

MainWindow will have an additional method `fetchTabInformation(tabName)`. After the parser executes the `TabCommand`, it will return a CommandResult with `Tab` property. +
System will then check whether the input name matches with one of the tab names in the system. If there is a match, system will fetch the tab information and return the `Tab` object. If no match is found, system will return with an empty tab with only name attached.

//end::tab-switch[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `HistoryManager`.
It extends `EngagementList` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `historyList` and `versionPointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `HistoryManager#saveState()` -- Saves the current engagement list state in its history.
* `HistoryManager#undo()` -- Restores the previous engagement list state from its history.
* `HistoryManager#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone engagement list state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveEngagementList()`, `Model#undoEngagementList()` and `Model#redoEngagementList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `HistoryManager` will be initialized with the initial engagement list state, and the `versionPointer` pointing to that single engagement list state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete i/5` command to delete the 5th person in the engagement list. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveEngagementList()`, causing the modified state of the engagement list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `historyList`, and the `versionPointer` is shifted to the newly inserted engagement list state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 3. The user executes `add t/meeting ...` to add a new engagement. The `add` command also calls `Model#saveEngagementList()`, causing another modified engagement list state to be saved into the `historyList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveEngagementList()`, so the engagement list state will not be saved into the `historyList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEngagementList()`, which will shift the `versionPointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous engagement list state, and restores the engagement list to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `versionPointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial engagement list state, then there are no previous engagement list states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#hasNoUndoableCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[width="750", align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` and `UndoState` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoEngagementList()`, which shifts the `versionPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the engagement list to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `versionPointer` is at index `historyList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest engagement list state, then there are no undone engagement list states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#hasNoRedoableCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `sort p/start o/ascending`. Commands that do not modify the engagement list, such as `sort`, will usually not call `Model#saveEngagementList()`, `Model#undoEngagementList()` or `Model#redoEngagementList()`. Thus, the `historyList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveEngagementList()`. Since the `versionPointer` is not pointing at the end of the `historyList`, all engagement list states after the `versionPointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add d/meeting ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[width="450", align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[width="190", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire engagement list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of engagement list states.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `historyList` and `engagementList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `jdeveloper.history.HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::sort[]

=== Sort feature
==== Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `EngagementComparator`.
The `EngagementComparator` is an enum class that implements Java Comparator<Engagement> and specifies the comparing logic of 8 different orders, namely `START_TIME`, `START_TIME_REVERSE`, `END_TIME`, `END_TIME_REVERSE`, `ALPHABETICAL`, `ALPHABETICAL_REVERSE`, `PRIORITY`, and `PRIORITY_REVERSE`.
Each positive sequence comparator compares two `Engagements` with the field specified within its name in ascending order, and `_REVERSE` comparators compare in descending order.

Additionally, the `Model` interface is modified to support the following methods:

* `Model#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)` -- Sets the designated comparator in model.
* `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()` -- Executes the sorting method with the `currentComparator` in model to sort the internal list.
* `Model#getSortedEngagementList()` -- Returns the current internal engagement list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList`.

These operations are implemented in the `ModelManager` class as `ModelManager#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)`, `ModelManager#updateSortedEngagementList()` and `ModelManager#getSortedEngagementList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `currentComparator` will be initialized as `null`.

image::SortListState0.png[width="450", align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `sort p/priority o/ascending` command to sort the engagement list in ascending order of priority. The `sort` command calls `Model#setComparator()`, causing the `currentComparator` in ModelManager to assume the value `EngagementComparator#PRIORITY`. The command then calls `Model#updateSortedEngagementList` to execute the sorting.

image::SortListState1.png[width="450", align="center"]

NOTE: The parsing of `sort` follows the interactive parsing structure *_Typee_* adopts, where various stages are created while parsing. See Sequence Diagram below.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="750", align="center"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `SortCommand` and the 3 Stages should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 3. The user executes `add t/meeting ... p/high` to add a new engagement. The `add` command also calls `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()` with `currentComparator`, causing the execution of sorting after the new engagement is added to the list, to preserve the current ordering.

image::SortListState2.png[width="450", align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentComparator` assumes the initial value `null` when `Model#updateSortedEngagementList` is called, the method will simply catch the `NullPointerException` thrown by `java.object.requireNonNull` which will essentially abort the attempt to sort with an empty catch block. The initial chronological order is preserved in this case.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the engagement list or alter the order of the list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#setComparator(Comparator<Engagement>)`, or `Model#updateSortedEngagementList()`. Thus, the internal `ObservableList` remains unchanged.

image::SortListState3.png[width="450", align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::SortUpdateActivityDiagram.png[width="190", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the `List.sort(Comparator<T>)` function to sort the list.
** Pros: Has trivial support for features that updates the predicate of `FilteredList`, like `Find`.
** Cons: There is a need to sort the list each time a command that modifies the elements of the list is executed, which may result in performance issues in case the list size is large.
* **Alternative 2:** Replace the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager` with a `SortedList`.
** Pros: Sorting the list is more intuitive, and the ordering of the engagements is automatically preserved whenever a command that modifies the list elements is executed.
** Cons: Features like `find` command may lose functionality and needs extra modification.

//end::sort[]

//tag::report[]

=== Engagement Report Generation
This feature allows user to generate a pre-selected engagement in to a report and save it as a document file. The document file will be created in a .pdf format.

==== Implementation Structure

.PdfCommand Implementation Class Diagram
image::PdfCommandClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

The feature will be implemented as an additional type of Command; `PdfCommand`

* Proposed syntax of the PdfCommand is as follow: `pdf i/ENGAGEMENT_LIST_INDEX t/RECEIVER f/SENDER`.

Util class `PdfUtil` will be implemented for handling all pdf document creation related methods. It will be implemented under `util` package and it will be able to deliver few essential features
that are necessary for document creation.

** Able to generate a full report document based on the `Engagement` as input.
** Use different templates for each other types of `Engagement` such as `Appointment`, `Interview` and `Meeting`. Document template will follow general email format:
Receiver, Engagement Information written in a table, Sender and signature with address and company logo.
+
To fulfill the document format, `Report` class needs to be implemented in order to model all necessary properties that has to be in the document. It 3 following properties;

***  `engagement`: specific engagement information to include in the document
*** `to`: A `Person` who is receiving the document
*** `from`: A `Person` who is either a receptionist or a secretary who is sending the document.

Below is the sequence diagram for document generation which displays the concept of how this feature will be implemented by multiple interaction between different architecture components.

.Sequence diagram for document generation.
image::GenerateReportSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== UI Design
`ReportWindow` will be the UI container which helps the user to interact using `PdfCommand`.
The window will include dynamic tree-view that is directly linked to the external directory in the file-system; `reports/`

===== UI Components & Features
Table below explains the components that are included in the `ReportWindow` with its purpose and features.

.Report Window UI Components

//end::report[]

=== Calendar Window

The `CalendarWindow` provides a visual representation of stored engagements over a monthly period.
Users can choose to change the month being displayed and also open scrolling text windows which
show more detailed descriptions of the stored engagements for a particular day.

==== Implementation Structure
.Structure of the Calendar Window
image::CalendarWindowClassDiagram.png[]
{empty} +
The `CalendarWindow` is part of the `MainWindow`. Specifically, it is one possible `Tab` which can be
displayed. The `CalendarWindow` class and any of its associated UI components can be found under the `com.typee.ui.calendar` package.

The following sequence diagram shows the creation of a `CalendarWindow` instance when the user switches to the
calendar window tab.

.CalendarWindow Initialization Sequence Diagram
image::CalendarWindowSequenceDiagram.png[]
{empty} +

==== UI Design
The `CalendarWindow` class was designed with the observer pattern in mind. The calendar's display and any open engagements
list windows are automatically updated as engagements are added to or deleted from the application. `CalendarDateCell` and
`EngagementListViewCell` both have a reference to an `ObervableList` of engagements in order to conform to the observer pattern.
The following table shows all UI components which are used and their respective purposes.

|===

==== Command Execution Workflows

The following are the four commands which interact with `CalendarWindow`. They are accompanied by their respective activity diagrams
which are used to model their workflows:

* `CalendarOpenDisplayCommand` -- Opens the engagements list window for the specified date.

* `CalendarOpenDisplayCommand` -- Changes the calendar window's display to the month prior to the currently displayed month.

.Previous Month Activity Diagram

{empty} +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Deciding whether to let engagements list windows from other months remain open when changing the displayed month

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only engagements list windows from the current month can be opened. Switching to other months
causes all opened engagements list windows to be closed.
** Pros: Easier to implement and does not take up much memory.
** Cons: Does not let users view engagement lists from different months simultaneously.
* **Alternative 2:** Letting engagements list windows remain open, regardless of the month, until they are closed by users.
** Pros: Users are able to view side-by-side comparisons of their engagement lists across different months.
** Cons: Introduces additional dependencies because many references to `ObervableList` instances must be maintained.

===== Aspect: Information being displayed in each calendar cell

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only display the number of engagements for each date.
** Pros: Does not take up a lot of on-screen space. More detailed information about each day's engagements can be viewed
by opening the engagements list window for that particular date.
** Cons: The information shown in the calendar window is very generalized.
* **Alternative 2:** Display the descriptions (and maybe more detailed information) of each date's engagements.
** Pros: Shows more detailed information in the calendar window.
** Cons: Might end up distorting the shape of the calendar window's cells since some engagements have more information than others.
The alternative would be to add fixed constraints to the size of each cell but then information would get cut off.

// tag::typinggame[]
=== Game Feature
==== Implementation
The game feature is implemented using the singleton pattern using the singleton class `GameWindow` which is created
by button-click in `StartWindow`. This means that there can only be one `gameInstance` at any given time with the exception
of the game being over. The two diagrams below show the UML sequence diagram and activity diagram of the game window, which
gives a high level overview of the game.

.Summary Sequence Diagram of Game Window
image::GameSequenceDiagram.png[]
//image::GameActivityDiagram.png[float="left"]
image::GameActivityDiagram.png[width="60%"]
.Activity Diagram of the Game Window

`GameWindow` has three main components `PlayerInformation`, `GameBody` and `Player`.

.Structure of the Game Window
image::GameWindowClassDiagram.png[]

The component `GameBody` makes use of `javafx.animation.AnimationTimer` API to continuously loop `MovingWords` objects moving from top
to bottom of the window using `GameBody#loopWords()`. `MovingWords` are created using
`HighlighterUtil#convertToTextFlowUsing(String word)`
, which appears as a `TextFlow` object of `javafx.scene.text` API.

Player input is represented as  a `javafx.beans.property.StringProperty` in `Player`.
Based on player input, `MovingWords` are updated using
`HighlighterUtil#convertToTextFlowUsing(String playerInput, String word)`
, which appears as a highlighted `TextFlow` object. In order to update the `MovingWords` object, the API
`javafx.animation.AnimationTimer` is used by calling `MovingWords#continuouslyUpdate()`.

The component `PlayerInformation` is bound to `Player` using `javafx.beans.property` API and is also updated when
`MovingWords#continuouslyUpdate()` is called.

The table below summarises the various purposes of the 3 main Game Window UI components.

|===

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Singleton pattern design of Game Window

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Game Window with Singleton pattern design
** Pros: +
*** Prevent users from instantiating multiple Game Windows which may cause performance issues or even cause the application
to crash.
** Cons:
*** Reduced testability as it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs, and increased coupling across code base.

* **Alternative 2:** Game Window without Singleton pattern design
** Pros: Increased testability and reduced coupling.
** Cons: There could be the risk of users being able to instantiate hundreds or thousands of GameWindows which would cause
performance issues or application crash issues.

// end::typinggame[]

//tag::interactive-parsing[]
=== Interactive Parsing

==== Overview

Interactive parsing allows users to build a command sequentially, as opposed to doing it entirely in one shot. A user that wishes to
add an interview can simply type `add t/interview` to receive prompts on what to enter next.

This feature was conceived to make the application easy to use for amateur users.

==== Design & Implementation

Important Classes:

* `InteractiveParser` - The interface exposed to `LogicManager`. The parser implements this interface.
* `Parser` - A concrete implementation of `InteractiveParser` that enables interactive parsing.
* `State` - An abstract class that represents the individual states the application can be in while parsing and building a `Command`.
* `EndState` - An abstract class that extends from `State`. Represents the final `State` of a parsed command, from which a `Command` object can be built.

The interface `InteractiveParser` is the connecting interface between the `LogicManager` and the main `Parser`. This interface is
designed by contract (DbC - proposed by Bertrand Meyer). The interface exposes four methods to the `LogicManager`, namely:

* `parseInput()` - Parses the entered input.
* `fetchResult()` - Returns the response to be showed to the user in a `CommandResult` object.
* `hasParsedCommand()` - Returns true if the `Parser` has finished parsing a `Command` fully.
* `makeCommand()` - Makes and returns the `Command` the user intends to execute.

To achieve interaction, the `Parser` keeps track of the `State` of the current `Command` being built. `State` is an abstract class that represents
the individual states the application can be at in the midst of building a `Command`. `EndState` is an abstract class that extends from `State`,
from which `Command` objects can be built. As and when valid inputs are entered, the `Parser` updates
the current `State` to the subsequent `States` of the corresponding `Command`.

The `Parser` starts at an idle, inactive `State` Upon entering `add t/meeting`, the `State` being tracked is changed twice - first
to the `State` corresponding to the type of the `Engagement` and then to the `State` responsible for the start date-time.

Such `State` changes happen sequentially until all the arguments necessary for the `Command` have been supplied. When all necessary arguments are present,
the `State` being tracked transitions into an `EndState`. Once the tracked `State` transitions into an `EndState`, the `Parser` builds the `Command`
which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

The structure of the interactive parser is detailed in the UML diagram below.

.Class diagram of the interactive parser. This figures shows an example of a state machine inside the package `State`.
image::InteractiveParserDiagram.png[]
{empty} +

[NOTE]
The above diagram only shows the component of the package `State` that handles the `PdfCommand`. The other packages have been
omitted for brevity.

Parsing of user entered inputs can be viewed as parsing a small, finite context-free language. The command built by a sequence of inputs
is uniquely determined by the sequence of inputs entered by the user and happens to be deterministic. +

This observation allows the `Parser` to be modeled by a *finite state machine*. A finite state machine is an
abstract computational model which consists of a machine comprising several states. At a particular point in time, only one state
of the state machine is active. The machine transitions from one state to another state if certain conditions are met.

In the context of Typee's `Parser`, the parser of each individual `Command` is a distinct finite state machine. The condition to be
satisfied to transition to another state is the validation of user-entered inputs.

The incorporation of state machines into the `Parser` is done by implementing a slightly modified version of the *state pattern*
documented by the *Gang of Four* (GoF).

Upon initiating the parsing (building) of a `Command`, the state machine that corresponds to the required `Command` is instantiated and set
to its initial state. This state becomes the `State` tracked by the `Parser` Subsequent inputs are tokenized by the `ArgumentTokenizer` class,
processed by the `InputProcessor` class and forwarded to the current `State`. If the input is deemed valid, the `Parser` invokes the `transition()`
method of the current `State` to proceed to the next `State`. This process is repeated until an `EndState` is reached. Throughout this process, the
user receives feedback from the `Parser` in the form of an encapsulated `CommandResult` object.

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the processes that occur when the user enters `add t/meeting s/15/11/2019/1500 e/15/11/2019/1600`.

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram incorrectly extends the life-line of the three destroyed `State` classes. This is due to a limitation of PlantUML.

The high-level working of the `Parser` can be summarized by the activity diagram shown below.

"parameter present" refers to the parameter required by a particular state.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect : Abstract model
* **Alternative 1 (current design)** : Finite state machine
** Pros:
*** Highly flexible - Entire command, one argument at a time and multiple arguments at a time - all are supported.
*** Easily extensible - Adding a new command will require almost no changes in any of the existing classes.
*** Supports optional arguments with the help of the `OptionalState` interface.
** Cons:
*** Tedious to implement a state machine for each individual command.

* **Alternative 2** : Use a list based implementation to keep track of arguments entered.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement and keep track of arguments
** Cons:
*** Very hard to implement optional states.
*** Cannot execute commands like `Help` at any point in time without hard-coding it in the `Parser`.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
