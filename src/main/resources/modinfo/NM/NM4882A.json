    "description": "This module will explore issues arising from play, creativity, and expressive political possibilities within online virtual worlds. The module begins with an introduction to modes of play, from open\u2010ended sandbox play, to modifications of existing games, to formal play elements. Readings from play and gender studies, political philosophy and art history inform this module. Questions to be addressed include how multiplayer game communities enable and disable diversity and identity experimentation, how the materiality of making virtual play objects unfolds and circulates, and whether 'serious' games escape the magic circle of play and enter the Real World.",
