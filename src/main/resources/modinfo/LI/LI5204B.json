    "description": "This module aims to provide a hands-on learning opportunity through the use of an easy-to-understand tool for students to address a wide range of supply chain management (SCM) problems. The tool allows students to model and focus on management decision analysis and use KPIs for operational, customer and financial performance measurement and decision-making. The module covers supply chain simulation and optimization examples via developing and building models and evaluating KPIs, and discusses how to use these models and their simulation and optimization results to improve management decision-making.",
