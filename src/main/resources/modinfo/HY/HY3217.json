    "description": "This module will focus on the colonial period in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. In addition to the political, social, and economic effects of colonial rule in each of these countries, attention will be given to the evolution of 'Indochina' as an entity created by the French and to its impact on relations among the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao peoples. These issues will be examined in the context of precolonial history and as a backdrop to the destructive warfare, that followed independence.",
