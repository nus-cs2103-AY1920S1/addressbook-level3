    "description": "This elective module covers a range of advanced topics in Quantum Mechanics. The basics of relativistic quantum mechanics will be covered: the Klein-Gordon equation; the Dirac equation and the covariant formulation of the Dirac theory, as well as the plane wave solution of the Dirac equation, the solution of the Dirac equation for a central potential and its non-relativistic limit The rest of the module is devoted to special topics, which may include the van der Waals interaction; the behaviour of electrons in solids; masers and lasers, the EPR argument and Bell\u2019s theorem, the interpretations of QM.",
