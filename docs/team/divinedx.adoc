== PROJECT: AddMin+

---

== Overview of Project

AddMin+ is student developed application under the National University of Singapore's __CS2103T Software Engineering Module__. In this module, we were organized to a team of 5 members for the software engineering project. The project requires us to enhance a basic command line interface desktop application, the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[AddressBook - Level 3] developed by the https://se-education.org/[se-edu team] for the the purpose of teaching Software Engineering principles.

== My Roles & Responsibilities

As Team Leader, I took charge of the overall direction of the project, working and communicating closely with all my team members to ensure that the project is well-maintained and coordinated. In addition, I defined, assigned and tracked project tasks for the group, maximizing use of Github's Issue Tracker and Project Board for task and milestone managememt. By frequenting providing feedback, either through Pull-Request Reviews or direct, verbal communication, I also helped to enforce high code quality and software engineering standards.

== Introduction to Application Components

This is a short section that aims to get the reader familiar and up to speed with the components in the AddMin+ app. AddMin+ contains two main entities: the `Event` and `Employee` components. Besides __Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)__ commands on both entities, AddMin+ is capable of manpower allocation, scheduling, salary management and statistics generation which requires interaction with both the `Event` and `Employee` objects through the use of the Date & Time mapping that sets the schedule and duration of an `Event`.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the *`Event` Component*, and most significantly the *Event Date-Time Mapping and its ancillaries*
** What it does: The `Event` Component features basic __Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)__ functionality, extended with the ability to store a list of `Employees` in a Manpower List and a Date-Time Map that stores the schedule of the `Event`. The Date-Time Mapping feature enables the user to accurately and precisely map a schedule of an existing `Event`, broken down into its individual dates and time period.

** Justification: The `Event` Component is critical for our application's functionality as its target audience is Administrative Staff in small companies managing events. The `Event` Component provides full flexibility for the user to manage event details through its CRUD functionality. Additionally, having a known date-time schedule of each `Event` supports the ability for administrative matters such as manpower allocation and schedule generation, ensuring that the employees are allocated to events efficiently without overlaps/conflicts in schedule.

** Highlights: This Date-Time Mapping feature is significant and is required for two other significant features of our application, manpower allocation and scheduling. To enhance the user experience and achieve our goal of simplifying tedious administrative work, I extended the functionality of the command to enable __quick assignment__ of dates and time by stating a date range, instead of just a single date to map. Overall, the implementation was challenging as I also needed to consider how edits to the start/end dates of the `Event` may break the manpower allocation or assigned date-time mapping and deal with them accordingly.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the *Fetch Employee* Command
** What it does: Shows the schedule of a single `Employee`, which displays a list of dates which itself contains a list of `Event` that the `Employee` is allocated to.

** Justification: It would be useful for either the adminstrative staff or the employee to view the current schedule of an `Employee` for tracking and logging purposes.

[[set_ev_dt]]
==== Setting a Date&Time to an Event: `set_ev_dt`

Sets a Date-Time Schedule Mapping for a specific Event.

[NOTE]
Even though the start date and end dates of each event is stated, the event is not assumed to be held for the entire range.
Hence, the Date-Time setting feature enables the user to _declare and set_ the schedule of the event.
Events are initialized without any schedule, other than their stated start and end date with a default time of __0800-1800__.

Format: `set_ev_dt EVENT_INDEX [on/EVENT_DATE] [till/EVENT_DATE] time/EVENT_DAYTIME`

****
* Note the <<Constraints>> for *INDEX*, *DATE*, and *TIME PERIOD*.
* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are *not used*, then all dates inclusive of the start to end date of the target event will be set with the stated `EVENT_DAYTIME`.
* If *both* the `on/` and `till/` prefixes are used, then the date range (inclusive) from the start to end date stated will be set with the stated `EVENT_DAYTIME`.
* If *only* the `on/` prefix is used, it will just set the `EVENT_DAYTIME` for the __single__ stated `EVENT_DATE`.
* The `till/` prefix must be used with the `on/` prefix, and not by itself.
* All `EVENT_DATE` *must be within the range of the Target Event's Start and End Date*
* The `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `on/` prefix cannot be after the `EVENT_DATE` declared by the `till/` prefix
****

Examples:

* `set_ev_dt 2 on/02/10/2019 time/1000-2000` +
Sets the 2nd Event from the Event List a time period of 10am-8pm on the 2nd of October 2019.

* `set_ev_dt 3 time/0500-1500` +
Sets the 3rd Event from the Event List a time period of 5am-3pm on all dates from the start to the end date (inclusive) of the Event.

* `set_ev_dt 1 on/02/10/2019 till/10/10/2019 time/0500-1500` +
Sets the 1st Event from the Event List a time period of 5am-3pm on all dates from the 2nd of October to the 10th of October (inclusive).

== Conclusion

While AddMin+ is not my first experience with a software engineering project, it introduced many  __good, quality__ software engineering practices and principles that I would apply to my future projects. This includes advance uses of the Github Issue Tracker, Project Workflow, PR Reviews, testing, and documentation. Despite the heavy workload, I thoroughly appreciate the learning experiences that would shape me to become a better software developer. Overall, I am satisfied to have worked with my team to bring the project to completion and release an elegant, high-quality product.
