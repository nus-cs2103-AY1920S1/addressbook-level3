    "description": "Scholarship in rhetorical and media studies has investigated photography\u2019s role in influencing audiences\u2019 attitudes towards issues requiring public response, such as environmental harm, social injustice, and military conflict. These photographs are rhetorical, making persuasive appeals to activate audiences to address such problems. This course examines questions that can be raised about the political, ethical, and persuasive power of such photos: are they objective documents or misleading propaganda? Do they unite audiences through sympathy or disempower them through compassion fatigue? What ethical responsibilities do photographers have toward their subjects? And how have citizens employed images to make their own public arguments?",
