== PROJECT: SugarMummy

---

== Overview

SugarMummy is a desktop application tailored for type 2 diabetics to better manage their day-to-day life.
Users interact with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has
about 30 kLOC.

Besides being a schedule planner cum reminder app, SugarMummy also supports logging of data such as
blood sugar level and BMI. As these data are closely linked to the severity of type 2 diabetes, they
can be summarized over a time period and presented in a visually intuitive graphical form. This helps
users to track progressions better. Moreover, there are achievements waiting to be unlocked and they serve
as extrinsic motivation for users to keep a healthy lifestyle. GUI font color and background are also
customizable to fully enhance user experience. The diet aspect is also taken care by SugarMummy which
recommends food and snacks beneficial for type 2 diabetics upon request.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to view daily, weekly or monthly average in a graphical form.
** What it does: `average` command allows users to track their daily, weekly or monthly progressions for different
record types. Averages are presented in a line graph. Different parts of the graph background are also colored differently
to demarcate healthy and unhealthy values. The graph also shows a legend box to describe the color used.
** Justification: Without this feature, user can only track their progression using `list` command. This requires them
to scroll through possibly hundreds and even thousands of records. Due to this infeasibility, `average` command is
introduced. The main part of tracking progression is to see the general trend
and this justifies the use of line graph. Lastly, graph demarcations are used because users may not
be familiar with the range of healthy and unhealthy values.
** Highlights: The first difficulty encountered when implementing this feature was how to group records
from same day, week or month together without using a separate code for each type. The solution can be
found in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-1/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/model/statistics/AverageMap.java[`AverageMap.java`].
The second difficulty was highlighting graph background with colors. JavaFX `LineChart` does not support
such functionality hence I had to implement the functionality through link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-1/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sugarmummy/ui/statistics/CustomLineChart.java[`CustomLineChart.java`]
which overrides JavaFX `LineChart`.

=== DATA SUMMARY/ANALYSIS

==== Displays the daily/weekly/monthly average of records in a line graph: `average`

Format: `average a/AVERAGE_TYPE rt/RECORD_TYPE [n/COUNT]`

AVERAGE_TYPE is either "daily", "weekly" or "monthly". +
RECORD_TYPE is either "bloodsugar" or "bmi". +
Displays a graph of the "daily", "weekly" or "monthly" average of a particular RECORD_TYPE. +
COUNT is an optional field that takes integer between 1 to 12 inclusive. +
If COUNT is given, SugarMummy shows **up to** COUNT most recent number of average values.
Else, COUNT is set to 5 by default and shows 5 most recent average values.

NOTE: If SugarMummy **does not show exactly** COUNT number of average values,
that means you do not have enough records in the database. Also, if you enter a field
more than once e.g `average a/daily rt/bloodsugar a/weekly`, only the last field will be
taken. In the example, weekly average will be calculated instead of daily average.

Example usage 1: `average a/weekly rt/bloodsugar`:
Shows the 5 latest weekly average of blood sugar records.

Example usage 2: `average a/daily rt/bmi n/9`:
Shows the 9 latest daily average of BMI records.


==== Summary statistics of a particular record type `[coming in v2.0]`

Shows minimum, maximum, average of a record type. Categorizes records into low, normal
and high values in a pie chart. User can specify the date interval of the summary by giving
a start date and end date.

==== Shows relationship between record types: `[coming in v2.0]`

User can see how a particular record type changes with other record types.
This information will be displayed on a scatter plot where trends can be spotted
easily. Note that this feature will work well only if

. You have records for both record types in any given day.
. You have more than 50 days worth of records.

==== Exports summary of all medical records into pdf `[coming in v2.0]`

Need to share your records with your doctor or others? With SugarMummy export function,
you can save any graphs and plots generated in a pdf file.

=== Data Summary/Analysis feature

==== Average graph feature: Displays the average values of records in a line graph: `average`

The average graph shows how the average blood sugar level or BMI of users change over time.
Daily, weekly, monthly average are supported.

===== Implementation

User input to get average graph is parsed by `SugarMummyParser` which creates a new `AverageCommandParser`.
`AverageCommandParser` then parses user input and creates a new `AverageCommand`. Next, `AverageCommand`
performs operations on `AverageMap` in `Model` with the help from `RecordContainsRecordTypePredicate` to
filter `UniqueRecordList` in `Model`. The result of the execution is returned to `Ui` as a
`CommandResult` object and is displayed to the user. In addition, `Ui` calls and displays average graph
related `.fxml` file to the user.

The average graph data points generation is implemented by `AverageMap` and the average values are stored
internally as `internalMap`. Additionally, it implements the following method:

* `AverageMap#calculateAverage()` - calculates and stores the average values needed by `AverageCommand`.
* `AverageMap#asUnmodifiableObservableMap()` - returns a read only version of `internalMap`.


These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#calculateAverageMap()` and
`Model#getAverageMap()` respectively.

===== Example Usage Scenario
Below is an example usage scenario and how average graph is created.

Step 1. User launches the application for the first time. The `AverageMap` will be
initialized and `internalMap` will be empty.

Step 2. User enters `average a/daily rt/bloodsugar n/4` in SugarMummy to get daily average blood sugar.
Input is parsed and send to `AverageCommand`. `AverageCommand` then calls `Model#updateFilteredRecordList()`
to filter record list with `RecordContainsRecordTypePredicate`. This results in a list of
records containing only blood sugar records. Subsequently, `AverageCommand` calls
`Model#calculateAverageMap()` to update the `internalMap` to store 4 most recent daily average values based on the filtered
record list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the average operation works:

.Sequence diagram of how average command calculates average values.

NOTE: The lifeline for `AverageCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 2a. If the user enters `average a/daily rt/bloodsugar n/4` and there is no data available,
then the command will fail to execute and throw a `CommandException`. Alternatively, if user enters
an invalid command, a `ParseException` will be thrown.
This is illustrated in the activity diagram below.

image::AverageCommandFailureActivityDiagram.png[]

Step 3. `Ui` receives average `CommandResult` from `LogicManager` and creates a new `AverageGraphPane`
as well as all other necessary components (see below). `Ui` then displays the `AverageGraphPane` to
user.

Average graph Ui consists of several parts:

* `AverageGraphPane`: Placeholder for `AverageGraph` and `LegendPane`.
* `AverageGraph`: Contains the average graph. Data points are generated by `internalMap`.
* `CustomLineChart`: The implementation for average graph which extends and override JavaFx `LineChart`.
* `LegendPane`: Placeholder for `LegendRow`. This is the legend box for average graph.
* `LegendRow`: Consists of a colored legend symbol and its description.

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to display average graph to user.

The dilemma arises because users, especially recently diagnosed type 2 diabetics,
do not know the normal range of BMI and blood sugar level. An intuitive and aesthetically
pleasing method is needed to convey this information to user.

* **Alternative 1:** Use JavaFx `LineChart` to display the average graph and display the ranges below
the graph using JavaFx `Label`.
** Pros: Do not need to implement anything.
** Cons: User need to trace data points to the y axis to find it's value and compare it with the
ranges given below the graph. This can be annoying and tedious for the user.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Override JavaFx `LineChart` by adding horizontal range markers
to the graph and color the area between the markers.
** Pros: User is able to tell which range a particular data point falls in immediately.
** Cons: Need to implement horizontal range markers and lay it out on the graph. In addition,
a custom legend box is needed to label the horizontal range markers.

==== Data Summary/Analysis Feature `coming in v2.0`

===== [Proposed] Summary statistics of a particular record type `[coming in v2.0]`

The implementation will be similar to average graph feature. The `UniqueRecordList` can be filtered
the same way as average graph feature to get a list containing only the specified record type.
If only records from a certain time period is needed, a new date predicate class needs to be created
to further filter the `UniqueRecordList` by starting and ending date. Using the filtered record list,
count the number of low, normal and high values based on some threshold set by the developer. These
counts will then be displayed using JavaFX `PieChart`. Also calculate the minimum, maximum and average of the
filtered record list. These 3 statistics will be displayed right under the pie chart as plain text.

===== [Proposed] Shows relationship between record types: `[coming in v2.0]`

The implementation will be similar to average graph feature. But now, `UniqueRecordList` needs to
be filtered so that it only contains the two record types needed. To do this, future developer
need to tweak the current `RecordContainsRecordTypePredicate` to be able to filter two different record types.

NOTE: Since SugarMummy only supports two record types now, filtering `UniqueRecordList` is
redundant. However, this implementation consider the situation that more record types may be added
in the future.

Using the filtered record list, pair two different record types from the same day together and this pair
represents a data point. Discard records that cannot be paired. Once the pairing process finishes,
display the points in JavaFX `ScatterChart`.

===== [Proposed] Exports summary of all medical records into pdf `[coming in v2.0]`

This feature can be implemented using `PDFBOX` libraries or any other existing libraries.
