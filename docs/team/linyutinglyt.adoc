This portfolio aims to highlight Lin Yuting's contributions to project 'LiBerry'.

== LiBerry

=== Overview

With the motivation to raise literacy rate in the world and encourage more setups of community libraries, my team has developed
Liberry - a desktop software for managing community and private libraries. The target users are mainly librarians looking to set up
or are already running private or community libraries, especially those in under-developed communities who cannot afford
commercial versions of such software.

LiBerry can execute the basic functions of library management:

* Addition and deletion of books in the catalog
* Registering Borrowers and editing their particulars
* Loan, return, renew and pay fine functions
* Searching through books in the catalog by filters

As part of the requirements of the project, we were given the source code for a common AddressBook
application and were tasked to morph it to something else that is useful.
We were also limited to designing software that takes in the majority of user input through a Command Line Interface
(CLI), though displays information through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

My role was to:

. configure the basic AddressBook software to create a `Borrower` class and its related classes.
. implement borrower-related commands such as the *Register Command*, *Serve Command*, *Done Command*, +
*EditBorrowerCommand* and *UnregisterCommand*

== Summary of Contributions

=== Main enhancement - Borrower-related features
added features related to the registering, unregistering and serving borrowers in our library management app, LiBerry.

==== What it does
allow our users, librarians, to *register* a borrower, *serve* a borrower, *edit* a borrwer and be able to *unregister*
a borrower from the library system.

==== Justification
These features are some of the core features to the library system

==== Highlights
The implementation was challenging as these features are widely used in other parts of the application.
It requires careful implementation and consideration for many different cases.

=== *Minor enhancement*:
* added a Borrower ID generator that auto generates a borrower's ID.

=== *Code contributed*: +

=== *Other contributions*:

==== Project management
* Managed the release of `v1.2` on GitHub. In `v1.2`, we have the following features:
** Set default user settings
** Exit the application
** Register a borrower into the library System
** Setting the application to serving mode
** Exiting the serving mode
** Loaning a book
** Returning a book
** Deleting a book


==== Enhancements to existing features:
* Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage
