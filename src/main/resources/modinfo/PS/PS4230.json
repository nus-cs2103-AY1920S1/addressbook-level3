This module examines the content, rationale, and outcomes of public sector reforms in China. Major topics include reforms on cadre personnel management, public finance, healthcare, education and enterprise systems. It helps students understand the significant role of public sector reforms in China\u2019s transition, and the new challenges caused by these reforms.",
