* `view c/2` +
Views the details of the second contact, if the contact list was last displaying at least two contacts

=== Create new contact: `contact`

Creates a new contact with a name and phone number. Each contact will be assigned a contact ID automatically. Optionally, an email, home address and tag(s) can also be specified. +

****
* Name and phone numbers are compulsory fields.
* Each contact must have a unique name.
* Names are limited to 40 alphanumeric characters.
* Phone numbers must be between 3 to 20 digits long.
****

Format: `contact n/CONTACT_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [tag/TAG] [a/ADDRESS]`

Creates a new activity with a title, contacts (optional) and no expenses.
****
* Additional contacts to add to the activity can be specified by using `p/` prefix.
** Initially, the application will search for contact with exact matching name.
** If no exact match is found, keyword matching is used instead. Refer to <<Finding contacts or activities: `find`>> for more details.
** For a contact to be successfully added, given keywords must have exact 1 matching contact. Otherwise, the activity will be created without adding the contact suggested by the keywords, and warning message will be shown.
* Changes the current view to this activity (as if `view a/ACTIVITY_ID` was called).
* Each activity will be assigned an activity ID automatically. +
****

Format: `activity t/ACTIVITY_TITLE [p/PERSON ...]`

Examples:

* `activity t/Chalet p/John Doe` +
Creates a new activity with title 'Chalet' John Doe as participants.

* `activity t/Breakfast p/David Li p/Bernice Yu` +
Creates a new activity with title 'Breakfast'. If the contact named 'Bernice Yu' doesn't exist, only the contact 'David Li' will be added in as a participant, and a warning message will be shown, stating that contact named 'Bernice Yu' could not be found.

// tag::invite[]
=== Inviting contacts to an activity: `invite`
This command invites the contacts specified to the current viewed activity.

Format: `invite p/PERSON ...`

Example: +
Suppose you have already created an activity with Alice, Bob and Carl in it. +
`activity t/Holiday Trip p/Alice p/Bob p/Carl`

And you have friends that wants to join an activity midway.

To invite:

Step 1: Type `invite` into the command box and specify the contacts you want to invite from the contact list with the `p/` prefix e.g. `invite p/Mary p/John p/Carl` and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::../images/InviteCommand.png[]

Step 2: Observe the output in result box and the activity details box.

image::InviteOutput.png[]

NOTE: *The `invite` command only invites to current viewed activity.* +
if there is no current viewed activity, there will be an error. +
 +
*The `invite` command only invites contact that exist in the contact list.* +
If the specified contact does not exist in the contact list, then the contact cannot be added and a warning message will be shown. +
 +
*Multiple contacts can be invited at once.* +
 +
*Contacts that already exist in activity cannot be invited again.*
// end::invite[]

// tag::disinvite[]
=== Disinviting contacts from an activity: `disinvite`
This command disinvites the contacts specified from the current viewed activity.

Format: `disinvite p/PERSON ...`

Example: +
Suppose you have an activity with the same participants but with an expense shared by Alice, Bob and John

image::DisinviteExample.png[]

And you feel that the activity has too many participants that do not participate in any event, thus having no shared expense and you decided to remove them.

To disinvite:

Step 1: Type `disinvite` into the command box and specify the contacts you want to disinvite from the activity with the `p/` prefix e.g. `disinvite p/Mary p/John p/Carl` and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::DisinviteCommand.png[]

Step 2: Observe the output in result box and the activity details box.

image::DisinviteOutput.png[]

NOTE: *The `disinvite` command only disinvites from current viewed activity.* +
if there is no current viewed activity, there will be an error. +
 +
*The `disinvite` command only disinvites contact that exist in the activity.* +
If the specified contact does not exist in the activity, then a warning message will be shown. +
 +
*Multiple contacts can be disinvited at once.* +
 +
*Contacts that involves in expenses cannot be disinvited.* +
If a contact is involved in any expense, he cannot be disinvited.
// end::disinvite[]

// tag::expense[]
=== Add expenses to an activity : `expense`

Creates a new expense with a list of contacts, an amount and an optional description, and adds it to the currently viewed activity. The first contact in the list is taken to be the person who paid for the expense, and the remaining people will be counted as owing the first person money. Any duplicated person will be ignored. +

If only one contact is specified in the list, then SplitWiser will assume that all current participants in the activity are involved in this expense and thus owe this person money. +

If no activity is being viewed, the description is compulsory - a new activity will instead be created with the same title as the description (as if `activity t/ACTIVITY_NAME` was called). The expense and contact(s) will then be added to the activity. You may wish to change the title of this new activity using the `edit` command thereafter (refer to <<Edit an existing contact or activity : `edit`>>). +

Format: `expense p/PERSON e/AMOUNT_PAID [p/PERSON ...] [d/DESCRIPTION]`

****
* Exactly one expense amount must be provided.
* The allowable expense amount for any single expense must range from $0.01 to $1,000,000 when rounded to 2 decimal places.
****

Examples:

* `expense p/John Doe e/100` +
Adds a single expense of $100 by John Doe to the currently viewed activity. If John Doe is not in the current activity, an error will occur and no expense will be created. Otherwise, all existing participants of the activity will now owe John a portion of the $100. +
If no activity is currently viewed, an error will occur as there is no description provided to use for automatic activity creation to contain this expense.
* `expense p/Mary e/100 p/Joseph p/Silva d/Drinks` +
Adds an expense of $100 to the currently viewed activity by Mary where Joseph and Silva are involved i.e. Joseph and Silva owe Mary a portion of the $100. This expense will be named `Drinks`. If any one of the participants are not in the present activity, then an error will occur and no expense will be created. +
Alternatively, if no activity is currently viewed, an activity titled `Drinks` will be created to contain this expense. Mary, Joseph and Silva will then be added to the activity.

NOTE: It is in fact possible to add an expense where no one else is involved in by specifying that the people involved only include the person who is paying, +
e.g. `expense p/John Doe e/15 p/John Doe d/Cab` +
This adds an expense of $15 by John Doe called `Cab` where only John himself is involved, thus no one owes anyone anything. This can be used to add an expense simply for recording purposes if desired, though it is not an intended use case for SplitWiser since there is no debt to calculate and resolve.
// end::expense[]

// tag::settle[]
=== Settle debts in an activity : `settle`

Settles the debt between two people within the currently viewed activity.
Specify two people, and optionally an amount `AMOUNT_PAID` to settle.

There are two options available:

* `AMOUNT_PAID` is not provided: then the command will automatically calculate the minumum needed to settle the debt and use that as the amount.
* `AMOUNT_PAID` is provided: the command will use this amount.

The first person specified `PERSON1` will pay `PERSON2`.

`PERSON1` and `PERSON2` can be any part of the names of the activity participants you wish to target.
Generally it is similar to how you would add an ordinary expense.
If no match is found for any person provided, or if multiple matches are found, the command will do nothing as it is ambiguous.

An entry will be added within the activity display so you can keep track of past payments.
These entries will have a generic description tagged to them to make it clear what it is.

Format: `expense p/PERSON1 e/AMOUNT_PAID p/PERSON2`

****
* You cannot settle wih an amount greater than what is needed.
* For example, if Bob owes Alice $10, you cannot settle with Bob paying Alice $20.
* Naturally this also means that in this case Alice paying Bob is not possible, since that would suggest paying a negative amount of money!
****

Examples:

* `settle p/John p/bob e/100` +
Adds an settlement to the activity stating thet John has paid Bob $100.
If John owes less than $100 to Bob, the command will be rejected.
If no activity is currently viewed, an error will occur as it is unclear where to add the entry.
* `expense p/Mary p/Joseph` +
Say Mary owes Joseph $10.
Then the command will add an settlement assuming Mary paid Joseph exactly $10.
If instead Joseph owes Mary $10, the command will fail, since in this case any way of Mary paying Joseph will only make the debt worse.
// end::settle[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Edit an existing contact or activity : `edit`

Edits some details of the current contact or activity in view. Note that contact names must be unique, so if a specified name already exists in the address book, the edit will not be processed. +

Format: `edit [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [tag/TAG ...]` for contacts OR `edit [t/ACTIVITY_TITLE]` for activities.

****
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Irrelevant parameters will be ignored. For example, `edit p/999 t/new title` when viewing an activity will only update the title to `new title`, and `p/999` will be ignored.
* Expenses cannot be edited.
****

Examples:

* `edit p/999` +
Edits the phone number of the current contact in view to `999`. No changes are made if a contact is not being viewed.
* `edit t/BBQ` +
Edits the title of the current activity in view to `BBQ`. No changes are made if an activity is not being viewed.
// end::edit[]

=== Finding contacts or activities: `find`

Finds contacts or activities whose name or title respectively contain *any* of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD ...`

****
* Find command can only be used when viewing list of activities or contacts.
* Find command will search for activities if used under list activity view. If used under list contact view, the find command will search for contacts.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name of contacts and title of activities are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Contacts and activities matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find John` +
If currently viewing list of contacts, returns contacts (e.g. `john` and `John Doe`).
If currently viewing list of activities, returns activities (e.g `lunch with john`).

// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting a contact, activity or expense: `delete`

Deletes the contact/activity/expense at the specified index from the current display. +

Format: `delete INDEX`

If current display is listing contacts e.g. `list c/`, the contact at that specified `INDEX` will be deleted if he/she is not involved in any activities.

If current display is listing activities e.g. `list a/`, the activity at that specified `INDEX` will be deleted.

If viewing an activity instead e.g. `view a/1`, it will soft-delete the expense* at that `INDEX`.

If the current display is not any of the above displays mentioned, error will be thrown.

Examples:

* `delete 2` +
If viewing the list of contacts, deletes the 2nd person by index if he/she is not involved in any activity. +

* `delete 1` +
If viewing the list of activities, deletes the 1st activity by index. +

* `delete 1` +
If viewing a particular activity, fades (soft-deletes) the 1st expense by index.

NOTE: *Deletes the entry at the specified `INDEX`.* +
 +
*The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed list of contacts/activities/expenses.* +
 +
*The `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...* +
 +
*Expenses cannot be completely deleted. It will instead be faded (but still visible) in the activity view.*

// end::delete[]

//tag::varexpense[]
=== Add variable split expenses to an activity: `varexpense` (*v2.0 only*)

Creates a new expense with a list of (contact, amount) pairs and an optional description, and adds it to the currently viewed activity. The very first (contact, amount) pair will represent the person paying and the amount paid. Every subsequent (contact, amount) pair will then represent the cost incurred by each person in this expense.

Format: `varexpense p/PERSON e/AMOUNT [d/DESCRIPTION] [(p/PERSON e/AMOUNT) ...]`

****
* The first amount (i.e. the paid amount) must be greater than or equal to the sum of all subsequent amounts specified.
* If the numbers do not add up to the paid amount, any excess value is taken to be incurred by the paying person.
****
//end::varexpense[]

=== Assign an activity as a sub-activity: `assign` (*v2.0 only*)

Assigns an activity as a sub-activity of the currently viewed activity. If no activity is currently being viewed, or an invalid activity ID is provided, no change is made.

Multiple activities can be assigned at once.

Format: `assign a/ACTIVITY_ID ...`

Examples:

* `assign 3 5`
If viewing an activity with title 'Family trip', assigns the activities with IDs 3 and 5 as sub-activities of 'Family trip'. Otherwise does nothing.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the application on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file contained in your current SplitWiser folder.

// tag::poweruser[]
== Powerusers

Certain features are not included intentionally, as some of them may potentially result in undefined behavior.
Hence, everything covered in this section is performed by *you* in the explicit knowledge that *something might break*!

=== Force deleting expenses
The default behavior for `disinvite` is to never allow permanant deletion for expenses.
What you will see instead is that it is striked out in the UI.
This is for good reason!
It preserves accountability and transparency.

You can however forcibly delete an expense by editing the `data/activitybook.json` file if you so incline.
Before anything, find out the `ID` of the expense that you wish to remove (this is different from the `#` index shown on the right of the GUI).
Ensure the application is closed, then find the activity in question in the `json`, and edit the `expenses` field as you wish.

After restarting you will see that the expense is permanantly removed from the activity.
The debts will have been recalculated as though it was never there.

CAUTION: Deleting an expense does not care about the existing debts caused by that expense!

=== Force disinvite from activity

[quote, User Guide on the disinvite command]
____
If a contact is involved in an expense, he/she cannot be removed.
____

To forcibly remove a contact from an activity, you will have to edit `data/activitybook.json`.
Before anything, find out the `ID` of the person that you wish to remove (this is different from the `#` index shown on the right of the GUI).
You should also be extremely sure that the contact is not involved in any other activities or expenses.
Ensure the application is closed, then find the activity in question in the `json`, and edit the `participants` field as you wish.

After restarting you will see that the person is permanantly removed from the activity.

CAUTION: This operation is very dangerous! The person might be included in expenses or other activities -- in that case, an error will be generated and the application will reset.
