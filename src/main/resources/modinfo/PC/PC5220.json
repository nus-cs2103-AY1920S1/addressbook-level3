    "description": "This module serves as an introduction to the physics of 2D-materials, the technological aspects of devices based on 2D-materials, and some of the experimental techniques used to investigate 2D-materials. We cover topics of basic science such as the Quantum Hall effects, Berry curvature, the role of defects, and strain induced gauge fields. We also treat experimental aspects such as fabrication and design of samples, and low temperature equipment. A range of experimental techniques used in this field of research will be covered, such as non-local voltage measurements, valley-selective optical excitation, spin-valves and more.",
