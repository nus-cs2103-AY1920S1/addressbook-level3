    "description": "In the module, principles of cell biology and signal transduction will be discussed, by using various signalling pathways as examples. The focus of the module is on applying the scientific method to define research questions, devise experimental strategies to test hypotheses and to critically analyze data. To this end, the module will consist of paper discussions, group presentations and research proposal development. The module will primarily focus on basic cell biology and signalling but also include clinical research related aspects.",
