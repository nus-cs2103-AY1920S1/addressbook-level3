    "description": "This module covers introduction to optical techniques, such as holography and shearography, in stress analysis of structures and one and two dimensional problems, thermal stress analysis, thermoelasticity and impact mechanics. Topics include parallel and series bar assemblies, plane strips, plates and bars, cylindrical and spherical shells, circular plates, cylinders and sphere. Stress waves in solids and the resultant failure and damage are studied. This module is targeted at engineers working in the manufacturing, aerospace and defense industries.",
