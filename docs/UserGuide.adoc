== Introduction

Budget Buddy is an all-in-one expense tracking application for students from the School of Computing (SoC)
at the National University of Singapore (NUS) who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their expenses.
More importantly, Budget Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command
Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you type fast, Budget Buddy can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Furthermore, Budget Buddy allows users with computing know-how to add their own functions through customized JavaScript files,
as well as set rules to simplify expense tracking through automation.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation of the current as well as upcoming features, including the setup
process, as well as some commonly asked questions. For the hands-on person, check out the _Quick Start_ section right
below.

== Quick Start

// end::accounts[]

// tag::loans[]
// tag::kenneth-ppp-loan-intro[]
=== Managing loans: `loan`

image::LoanUG1.png[width=85%,scaledwidth=85%]

This feature enables you to keep track of who owes you money - and exactly how much they owe you.
Never again allow those small sums you lend out to accumulate into a massive pile of forgotten gold.
You can also record who you owe money to, saving you the embarrassment of being publicly reminded by your loan shark friends.
Finally, it can even help you calculate who owes who how much
when you and said friends wake in the morning after an expensive night out.
// end::kenneth-ppp-loan-intro[]

==== Add a new loan: `loan out|in`

This command adds a new entry to the loan list in the main display panel.
The loan will be inserted in an appropriate position based on the list's current sorted order.
For example, if the list is sorted by amount in descending order and the new loan has the largest amount,
it will appear at the top of the list.

To execute this command, type the details of the loan in the following format.

Format: `loan out|in p/<person> x/<amount> [w/<date>] [d/<description>]`

If a date is not provided, the loan's date is set to the current date.

Examples:

* `loan out p/John Doe x/50 w/23/04/2019` +
Adds a new loan of $50 out to John Doe on the date 23/04/2019.
* `loan in p/Jane Doe x/100 d/Lent me some money for booze.` +
Adds a new loan of $100 in from Jane Doe, with the description "Lent me some money for booze.".

==== List loans: `loan list`

This command displays the list of loans in the main display panel.
Arguments can be added to sort and filter the list.
The full command format with all its possible arguments is as follows.

Format: `loan list [out|in|unpaid|paid ...] [p/<person> ...] [x/<amount> ...] [w/<date> ...] [d/<description> ...] [s/w|x|p]`

****
*Filtering*

* Filter loans using one or two of the `out`, `in`, `unpaid`, `paid` filters.
If two are used, they should not be duplicates.
Contrasting filters can be used (e.g. `out in`) but they will be joined with logical `AND`,
so the resulting list would be empty.
* Filter loans by persons, amounts, dates and descriptions
by adding one or more of the `p/<person>`, `x/<amount>`, `w/<date>`, `d/<description>` filters respectively.
* If more than one filter is used, filters will be joined using logical `AND`.
For example, `loan list out p/Duke` will result in the filter: loans out `AND` loans involving Duke.
* Adding a new loan to the list will reset all filters. Other list operations (edit, paid/unpaid, delete) will not.

*Sorting*

* Sort loans by date, amount, or persons' names using `s/w`, `s/x`, or `s/p` respectively.
* Sorting the list by a property when it is already sorted by that property will reverse the order of sorting
(e.g. newest date first to oldest date first).
****

Examples:

* `loan list out unpaid p/John Doe` +
Lists all unpaid loans out to the person named "John Doe".
* `loan list s/p` +
`loan list s/p` +
Lists all loans sorted by persons in alphabetical order. Then lists all loans again, but sorted by persons in reverse alphabetical order.

==== Edit loan: `loan edit`

This command edits the details of an existing loan in the list.
Once edited, the loan will be re-sorted into an appropriate position based on its new details and the current sort order.
For example, if the list is sorted by date with the newest loan first,
editing the loan at the top of the list to have the oldest date will move it to the bottom of the list.

To execute this command, type the index of the loan (as seen in the main display panel) and the details to be edited
in the following format.

Format: `loan edit <index> [<p/person>] [x/<amount>] [d/<description>] [w/<date>]`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed loan list.
It must be a positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3...).
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:

* `loan list` +
`loan edit 1 x/500 d/Dude owes me so much money I can't even.` +
Lists all loans, then edits the amount and description of the first loan in the list to the given values.

// tag::kenneth-ppp-loan-paid[]
==== Mark loan(s) as paid: `loan paid`

This command marks one or more loans in the list as *paid*.
A paid loan can be visually distinguished by a large "tick" icon to the left of its index:

image::LoanUG2.png[width=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

Multiple loans can be marked at once.
This can be done by specifying several indices or at least one person to target.
The format of the command is as follows.

Format: `loan paid [<index ...>] [<p/person ...>]`

****
* If a person's name is specified, all their loans are marked as paid.
* At least one index or person must be specified.
* Marking an already paid loan will re-mark the loan as paid (to no visible effect).
* If multiple indices and/or persons are targeted but an index or person cannot be found in the currently displayed list,
the indices and/or persons that can be found will still be marked.
****

Examples:

* `loan list` +
`loan paid 1 2 3` +
Lists all loans, then marks the first three loans in the list as *paid*.
* `loan paid p/John p/Adam` +
Marks all loans pertaining to John and Adam as *paid*.
// end::kenneth-ppp-loan-paid[]

==== Mark loan(s) as unpaid: `loan unpaid`

This command marks one or more loans in the list as *unpaid*.
When a paid loan is marked as unpaid, its tick icon will disappear:

image::LoanUG3.png[width=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

This command is executed in an identical manner to `loan paid`.
Its format is as follows.

Format: `loan unpaid [<index ...>] [<p/person ...>]`

==== Delete loan(s): `loan delete`

This command deletes one or more loans from the list.
Similarly to `loan paid` and `loan unpaid`, multiple loans can be deleted at once.
Its format is as follows.

Format: `loan delete [<index ...>] [<p/person ...>]`

[[loan-split]]
// tag::kenneth-ppp-loan-split-1[]
==== Calculate loans: `loan split`

This command takes a group of persons and a list of amounts each person has paid,
before calculating which persons need to pay which other persons
such that the total amount paid is split equally among all the group's members.

For example, let's say you're out for dinner with two friends.
When the hundred-dollar bill arrives, you pay for the first sixty and one of your two friends pays for the remaining forty.
The `loan split` command can now help you to calculate how much your two friends owe you,
such that the hundred-dollar bill is split equally among you three.

This command comes with many optional arguments, all of which are explained below.
The format of the command is as follows.

Format: `loan split p/<person> x/<amount paid> [max/<limit>] ... [me/<your name> w/<date> d/<description>]`
****
* Each `<person>` corresponds to an `<amount paid>`, representing how much the `person` paid for the group initially. +
The order of a `person` in the list should match the order of their `amount paid`.

*Limiting a Person's Share*

* The final amount a `person` ends up paying can be restricted to a `<limit>`.
* The order of all `limits` should match the order of all `persons`
i.e. the first `<limit>` in the input will correspond to the first `<person>`,
the second `<limit>` the second `<person>`, and so on.
As such, persons with limits should be placed at the head of the list.
This is to allow you to enter limits only for those persons who require them.
* The sum of all limits should not exceed the total amount paid by all persons.

*Automatically Adding Debts to Your Loan List*

* Adding the optional `me/` will add all debts from the resulting list to your loan list.
+
`<your name>` must match one of the persons among the other `p/<person>` names.
* Adding `w/` will set the `<date>` of the loans added to your loan list.
* Adding `d/` will set the `<description>` of the loans added to your loan list.
****
// end::kenneth-ppp-loan-split-1[]

// tag::kenneth-ppp-loan-split-2[]
To switch between your loan list and split list, press kbd:[Ctrl+D] (or kbd:[Cmd+D] for Mac) while on the Loan tab.

[NOTE]
The split list will initially be empty,
but once a list is calculated it will persist in the Loan tab across sessions (until a new calculation is made).

Examples:

* `loan split p/John x/0 p/Mary x/40 p/Peter x/60` +
Calculates the money owed between `John`, `Mary` and `Peter` for a scenario where (initially) `Mary` paid `40` and `Peter` paid `60`. +
The resulting display should show that `John` owes `Mary` *$6.66* and also owes `Peter` *$26.67*, as seen in the image below.

image::LoanUG4.png[width=85%,scaledwidth=85%]

* `loan split p/John x/0 max/10 p/Mary x/10 p/Peter x/90 me/Mary d/Dinner.` +
In this scenario, `Mary` paid `10` and `Peter` paid `90`.
`max/10` restricts the final amount `John` pays/owes to `10`, despite the total amount being `0 + 10 + 90 = 100`.
Furthermore, `me/Mary` marks `Mary` as the user (you),
so any debts `Mary` owes/is owed will be added to the normal loan list with the description `Dinner.`. +
The resulting display should show that `John` owes `Peter` *$10* and `You` owe `Peter` *$35*, as seen below.

image::LoanUG5.png[width=85%,scaledwidth=85%]

The latter debt will also have been added to your loan list,
which can be checked using the command `loan list` or by pressing the hotkey mentioned above.
// end::kenneth-ppp-loan-split-2[]
// end::loans[]

// tag::rules[]
=== Automating with rules: `rule`

*Introducing the _Rule Engine_.*
A way for you to automate certain actions based on a certain predicate.
Spend less time typing repetitive commands, and spend more time keeping track of your expenses!

Rules have the following structure: If "predicate" is true, then perform "action". By creating a
predicate which defines the condition you set, you can perform any action you create whenever a
transaction is added/edited, if the transaction satisfies that condition.

All rules in the Rule Engine will be executed on a transaction, when:

* It is a new transaction and has been successfully added into an account. *OR*
* It is an existing transaction and has been successfully edited.

WARNING: All rules will be executed from the top of the list downwards.
Typically, this is the order in which the rules were added.
Rules with conflicting actions will therefore be allowed.

==== Add a new rule: `rule add`

Adds a new rule to the rule engine.
Both the predicate and action have to be specified.
A rule can be formed using either expressions or scripts, or both.

Format: `rule add p/<expression | script name> a/<expression | script name>`

NOTE: Note that scripts used in rules are not validated; make sure they are free from error.
Predicate scripts that do not return a boolean _will be executed_, but will therefore implicitly return false.
Action scripts will be executed if the predicate returns true, and any return value will be discarded.

****
*Expression Formatting Guide:*

* **Predicate**: In the order of `<attribute> <predicate operator> <value>`
** An attribute can be one of the following:
*** `inamt` : Transaction amount inwards
*** `outamt` : Transaction amount outwards
*** `desc` : Transaction description
*** `date` : Transaction date
** A predicate operator can be one of the following:
*** `=` : Equality comparison operator
*** `<` , `\<=`  , `>=` , `>` : Inequality comparison operators
*** `contains` : Substring check operator (Cannot be used on dates)
** A value can be a number or a string of length not more than 180 characters
It can contain the following special characters: +
!#$%&'*+=?`+_+/[{|}]~^.-

* **Action**: In the order of `<action operator> [<value>]`
** An action operator can be one of the following:
*** `set_cat` : Adds a category to the transaction
*** `remove_cat` : Removes a category from the transaction
*** `set_desc` : Sets the description of the transaction
*** `app_desc` : Appends a value to the description
*** `prep_desc` : Prepends a value to the description
*** `set_in` : Sets the direction of the transaction to be inwards
*** `set_out` : Sets the direction of the transaction to be outwards
*** `switch_direct` : Switches the current direction of the transaction
** A value is as described in a predicate expression,
and is not required for `set_in`, `set_out` and `switch_direct`

*Script Usage in Rules:*

* Scripts used in rules have access to two additional arguments:
** The transaction to test/act upon is stored in `argv[0]`
** The account that the transaction belongs to is stored in `argv[1]`
* Refer to <<Scripting>> for general script usage.
****

Examples:

* `rule add p/outamt >= 100 a/prep_desc [Large Spending]` +
Adds a new rule that specifies that if an outward transaction has an amount more
than or equal to $100, prepend the transaction's description with "[Large Spending]".

* `rule add p/desc contains food a/set_cat Food` +
Adds a new rule that specifies that if a transaction description contains "food",
add the category "Food" to that transaction.

* `rule add p/IsMonthlyAllowance a/set_desc Monthly Allowance` +
Adds a new rule that specifies that if the script named "IsMonthlyAllowance"
returns true, change the transaction's description to "Monthly Allowance".
// end::rules[]

==== List rules: `rule list`

Displays the list of all existing rules in the Rule Engine.
Rules are sorted by the order in which they were added.

Format: `rule list`

==== Edit a rule: `rule edit`

Edits the specified fields in the rule with the specified ID.
Both the predicate and action can be modified.

Format: `rule edit <rule ID> [p/<expression | script>] [a/<expression | script>]`

Examples:

* `rule edit 1 p/inamt \<= 10` +
Edits the predicate of the first rule in the list to check if an
inward transaction has an amount less than or equal to 10.

* `rule edit 4 a/set_in` +
Edits the action of the 4th rule in the list to set the direction of
a transaction to be inwards.

==== Delete a rule: `rule delete`

Deletes a rule with the specified rule ID.

Format: `rule delete <rule ID>`

Examples:

* `rule delete 5` +
Deletes the 5th rule in the list.

// tag::ruleswap[]
==== Swap two rules: `rule swap`

NOTE: Ths will affect the execution order of the rules.
Rules will be executed from the top of the list downwards.

Swaps the position of two specified rules in the Rule Engine.

Format: `rule swap <rule 1 ID> <rule 2 ID>`

Examples:

* `rule swap 2 4` +
Swaps the ordering of the 2nd rule and the 4th rule.
// end::ruleswap[]

// tag::scripting[]
[[Scripting]]
=== Scripting: `script`

The scripting engine allows you to evaluate arbitrary scripts to perform complex operations on your transaction data,
as well as extend the application and add commands and features of your own.

The scripting language is JavaScript (specifically, ECMAScript 5.1). For more details on the scripting environment and API, see <<Scripting API,here>>.

WARNING: Scripts have full access to the application's internals, as well as all Java standard library classes and APIs.
It is possible to corrupt the application state by execution of a malicious or buggy script. There are no guarantees on
application behaviour if scripts are used.

[#script-eval]
==== Evaluate a script: `script eval`

Evaluates a script and displays the result, which is the last expression evaluated in the script.

Format: `script eval <script>`

Examples:

* `script eval 1`
+
Evaluates to: `1`

* `addTxn(1000, 'out', 'Lunch')`
+
Adds an out-transaction for $10 with description "Lunch".

[#script-add]
==== Add a stored script: `script add`

Stores a script for future invocation. If a script with the same name already exists, that script is replaced.

Format: `script add <script name> [d/<description>] [p/<file path> | s/<script>]`

****
* Script names may contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes.
* Script names are case-sensitive.
* The file path may be absolute or relative. If it is relative, it is relative to the _current working directory_ of Budget Buddy.
** If you launched Budget Buddy from the command line, the current working directory starts from the directory your shell was in.
** If you launched Budget Buddy by double-clicking the JAR file, the current working directory is typically the directory the JAR file is in.
** There is no command that changes the current working directory, but a script may have done that.
* If neither a file path nor the script code is given, a file browser is opened for you to
select the script file.
****

WARNING: The script is not checked for correctness before it is stored. Any syntax errors
will be reported only when the script is run.

Examples:

* `script add hello-world s/"Hello world!"`
+
Adds a script named `hello-world` that simply results in "Hello world!" being printed.

* `script add add-transport d/Adds today's transport fare.`
+
Adds a script named `add-transport` with description "Adds today's transport fare.". A file picker is opened for you to select the script file.

[#script-delete]
==== Delete a stored script: `script delete`

Deletes a previously-stored script.

Format: `script delete <script name>`

****
* Script names are case-sensitive.
****

[#script-run]
==== Run a stored script: `script run`

Runs a previously-stored script and displays the result, which is the last expression evaluated in the script.

Format: `script run <script name> [<argument>]`

** Executing `abcd efgh 7890 abcd` is equivalent to executing `script run x abcd`.
* The alias name must appear at the start of a command line, followed by a space, for it to be recognised.
* There is no restriction on the characters in the alias name. However, leading and trailing whitespace will be trimmed.
* Aliases can expand to other aliases.
****

WARNING: Built-in commands take precedence. If you add an alias with the same name as a built-in command, it will have no effect.

== Scripting API

The Nashorn scripting engine is used. All features and Java class access of the Nashorn engine are available. See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/nashorn/nashorn-java-api.html[Nashorn documentation] for more details.

Budget Buddy defines a few global variables and functions to ease script writing. These are documented below.

NOTE: Due to the nature of JavaScript, scripts may modify these variables and functions. To reset the script
environment, use <<script-reset,the `script reset` command>>.

=== Global variables

The following global variables are predefined in the script environment.

* `bb`: The application's model, of type `ModelManager`.
+
[WARNING]
====
Modifying data through the model directly can result in inconsistent state,
or corrupted data. Where possible, you are strongly recommended to use the helper functions
documented below.

To discourage use of `bb`, the API is intentionally left undocumented. You may
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/budgetbuddy/model/ModelManager.java[refer to the Java source code]
if you wish to use `bb`.
====

=== Functions

The following helper functions are predefined in the script environment.

****
**Function signatures**

Function signatures specified below are in the following format:

`functionName(parameter1, parameter2, { optionalParameter1, optionalParameter2 }) -> ReturnType`

Optional arguments should be given as a single JavaScript object. For example, for the above signature:

`functionName("argument 1", "argument 2", { optionalParameter1: "optional argument 1" })`

**Types**

* If the type starts with a capital letter e.g. `Account`, it is a Java type.
* If the type starts with a lowercase letter e.g. `number`, it is a JavaScript primitive.
* If the type is `[Type]`, it is an array of `Type`.
* If a function's return type is unspecified, the function does not return a value.
