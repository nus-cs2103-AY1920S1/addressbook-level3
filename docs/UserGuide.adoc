== Introduction

T.A.rence is for Teaching Assistants (TAs) who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their TA responsibilities.
T.A.rence is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, T.A.rence can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

.  Download the latest `.jar` link:{URL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
