    "description": "This course provides an overview of energy management system in the building context. The concept of micro- and nano-grids in building context will be introduced. Renewable and distributed energy generation systems such as building integrated PV and rooftop solar-PV will be discussed with different scenarios of power flow e.g. building-to-building and building-to-grid integration will be introduced. Load side management to demand response strategies will be introduced. Furthermore, the course also includes power flow analysis and power quality analysis, system planning and operation, fault detection and various new and emerging technologies in modern buildings.",
