    "description": "When we open our eyes, we feel that we are seeing the world as it is in front of us. But scientific studies reveal that we are seeing only a tiny fraction of that world, and that what we do see (and hear, and smell, and touch) is not the world 'as it is' \u2013 but as it is represented to us through the filters of our biology, or technology, and our culture. This module will examine the ways in which these three important forces enable, limit and shape the ways that we perceive 'the world in front of us'.",
