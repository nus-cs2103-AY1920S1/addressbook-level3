    "description": "A predominant pattern in Western epics has been the 'Novel of Formation' (Bildungsroman) \u2013 the novel that follows an individual through the stages of her life. The last century has seen a radical reversal. Instead of narrating a life\u2019s development, the new novel concentrates on the institution that shapes individuals and renders them subjects (school, bureaucracy, court of law etc.). The German\u2010Czech writer Kafka is the master of the new genre. The course highlights Kafka\u2019s 'The Trial' as a 'novel of institution' while drawing on related works including 'The Castle,' and exploring concepts such as 'institution,' 'novel,' 'form of life.'",
