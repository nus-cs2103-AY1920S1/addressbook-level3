    "description": "The founding of the Round City of Baghdad in the mid 8th century by the ascendant \u2018Abbasid dynasty ushered in a period of intense scholarly, administrative and artistic activity. The rulers patronized poets and prose writers and supported translation from Greek, Persian and other languages into Arabic; learned individuals hosted intellectual discussions (and meals and drinking sessions) late into the night at their homes; the literati spent entire nights in bookstores voraciously reading everything they could lay their hands on; theologians and philosophers debated the nature of reality and of God; scientists tested theories in engineering, medicine, and mathematics; and travelers reported their discoveries from China and India. For these, and many more reasons, the 9th and 10th centuries in Baghdad have come to be glorified as the \u2018golden age.\u2019 In this Special Seminar, we will read works by and about Baghdadis, including Ibn al-Marzubani on why dogs are better than people, Abu Nuwas on wine and song, medieval graffiti, and gift lists. We will read about the caliph Harun al-Rashid and the elephant he sent Charlemagne, and the mystic al-Hallaj and how he was drawn and quartered and crucified. We will enter the world of the singing sensation \u2018Arib, who was the lover of some of Baghdad\u2019s most famous men, and some stories from the Arabian Nights. We will see how paper, books and writing changed Baghdad, Islamic society, and human knowledge; and how Arab-Islamic society\u2019s contributions changed the world.",
