== PROJECT: SecureIT

This document outlines my contributions to the project *SecureIT*.

== Overview
With the increasing digitisation of all businesses, managing one's digital life has become highly complex.
Having realised this problem, my group and I created **SecureIT** as part of our software engineering project.

SecureIT is designed to be an all-in-one management tool for all confidential information. It targets workers in startups, and boasts management capabilities for:

* Passwords | Secret Files | Secret Notes | Credit Cards

SecureIT operates via a Command-Line Interface(CLI), and executes accordingly to the user inputted commands.

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section acts as a summary of my contributions to SecureIT._
|===
* *Major enhancement: the ability to analyse the level of security of the users' passwords.*

** What it does: The password analysis feature provides the ability to evaluate and subsequently view details about the security level of each of the user's passwords.

** Justification: This feature greatly improves the utility of SecureIT because the various analysis tests allows the user to identify different weaknesses in their password and thereby make the necessary corrections to ensure the security of each account.

** Highlights: It was highly challenging to implement the analysis feature. Some of the key considerations include:

*** Design: The design of the entire analysis component follows that of a *Command Pattern*. This greatly increases the extensibility of the analysis feature to accommodate even more types of analysis tests in the future.
*** Data structure and algorithms: The implementation of the various analysis tests requires the use of more complex concepts such as recursion and multiple pointers.
The implementation also required knowledge on the use of more complex data structures such as TreeMaps and HashMaps in order to help boost the efficiency of the product.

* *Major enhancement: the ability to generate random secure passwords.*

** What it does: The password generation feature provides the ability to generate customisable, and truly random passwords.

** Justification: This feature greatly improves the utility of SecureIT because it alleviates the user of needing to think of a password whenever he needs to create a new account. More importantly, the password provided is guaranteed to be random and thereby secure.

** Highlights: It was challenging to implement truly random password generation.
In-depth research was required on how best to generate truly random passwords.
The generation of passwords leverages on the `java.security.SecureRandom` API for a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) to make the password generation as random as possible.

* *Other contributions:*

** Team contributions:
*** Implemented the method to copy text into the user's local clipboard, which was subsequently used by my teammates in the copy features they implemented. (examples: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CopyCardNumberCommand.java[1], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CopyPasswordValueCommand.java[2], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CopyUsernameCommand.java[3])
*** Reported bugs and offered suggestions for teammates. (examples: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/189[#189], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/190[#190])
** Project management:
*** Helped create and assign some issues for each milestone in the lead up to the project submission. (examples: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/29[#29], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/28[#28], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-3/main/issues/26[#26])
** Documentation
*** Made cosmetic improvements to the existing User Guide by creating the project logo.
