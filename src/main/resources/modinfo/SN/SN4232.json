    "description": "The module will discuss the emerging pattern of inter-regional tourism flows between South and Southeast Asia. One of the facets of increasing globalisation is the expansion of the tourism industry. For the South Asian region, in particular India, higher incomes and the emergence of an expanding middle class have created a new market for the outbound tourism industry. The trappings of the new middle class in India would include holidays abroad and Southeast Asian region has become more widely known in India. The long historical, religious and cultural linkages between South and Southeast Asia would add to the tourism flows between the two regions. Recent developments that will spur tourism included the Open Skies policy being negotiated between India and ASEAN plus the upgrading and modernisation of infrastructure in India.",
