    "description": "Did nature make humans, or have humans made nature? Or are both continuously co-evolving, and changing in relation to one another? This module explores the practices and institutions through which contemporary societies understand and appropriate the natural world. We use concepts from environmental sociology and anthropology, to look at how different societies\u2019 engagements with nature reshape social thought. Students will learn research skills such as ethnographic fieldwork; critical analysis of environmental policies; and interpreting discourses on issues like energy and environmental crises. This will be useful in professional fields including conservation, urban planning, policy-making, infrastructural services, development and aid-work.",
