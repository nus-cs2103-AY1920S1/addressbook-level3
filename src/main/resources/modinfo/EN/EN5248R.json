    "description": "From Shakespeare\u2019s Shylock to Kafka\u2019s Gregor Samsa, Lu Xun\u2019s Ah-Q and Sinha\u2019s Animal, it could be said that 'rejects' abound in literature. This module is an inquiry into the affective forces of such literary rejects, such as their ability to generate empathy within both readers and other textual characters, or to elicit from the latter a sense of 'poetic' justice beyond existing juridicial norms, as well as how they complicate the literary 'I' or subject. Texts read in the module will include Shakespeare\u2019s Merchant of Venice, Kafka\u2019s 'Metamorphosis,' Lu Xun\u2019s 'The Real Story of Ah-Q,' and Indra Sinha\u2019s Animal People.",
