    "description": "This course teaches students how to systematically analyse complex policy problems and conduct policy design to address long-term challenges. The skillset is generic and can be applied to different domains (e.g. Transport, Environment, Energy, Health, etc.). This makes this course crucial for professionals with functions that require long-horizon thinking and decision-making. Relevant theories and techniques and their limitations covered include system analysis, actor analysis, policy networks, problem formulation, definition of goal hierarchies, information gathering, generation of a library of policy measures, analysis and selection of policy measures, multi-criteria decision making, generation of alternative solutions, and analysis of their trade-offs.",
