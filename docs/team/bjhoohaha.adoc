== Summary of contributions

Out of the 6 different components of the _TravEzy_ application, I was responsible for the development of the
*Achievements* and enhancing the *Address Book*.

=== Major enhancement: +
The achievements component of the _TravEzy_ application. The achievements page generate statistics from the 5
different existing features: address book, calendar, diary, itinerary and financial tracker.

==== Navigating around the achivements page:

image::AchievementsInterface.png[width=800]

==== What it does:
Upon navigating to the page, the achievements page generates the statistics for each feature. Thus this allows you to
keep track of their progress within the application and provides a nice summary for each feature by looking at its
statistics.

For instance, if an input `delete 2` is entered in the address book, which deletes the 2nd person in the list. The
achievements page will reflect the following changes:

image::bjhoohahaAchievementChanges.png[width=800]

[NOTE]
Any recent changes in the other pre-existing feature of _Travezy_ namely: address book, calendar, diary,
financial tracker and itinerary will update the  Statistics inside the Achievements Page.To find out more what statistics are generated for each feature, you can look

====
By looking at your overall progress, this feature aims to:

* Motivate you to travel more during your free time
* Provide insights on your travelling habits
* Provide insights on your expenditure habits
====

==== Highlights
The *Achievements* feature is live and up to date to reflect the latest statistics for each feature. To find out
more what statistics are generated for each feature, you can look

=== Minor enhancement: +
In the address book component, I added a country field to the person in address book.  +

image::AddressBookInterface.png[width=800]

==== What it does
When adding a person into the address book, you can specify the person's country. The contact's country will be
displayed in the _persons list panel_.

==== Justification
A traveller travelling to many different country would have multiple contacts from different foreign countries.
A specialized address book that specifies a country field for the added contact can better help to tailor to
travellers need to better manage their contacts in the address book.

== Achievements


You dream to become a top traveller travelling far and wide.. You have used _TravEzy_ extensively and would want to keep
track of your travel progress. From each of the different features inside _Travezy_, you are curious to find out the
progress of the goals you have set for yourself. This will allow you to gain insights about your travelling and spending
habits to motivate yourself to travel more, spend less and record all your favourite moments!

_TravEzy_ application consist of 5 different features: Address Book, Calendar, Diary, Financial Tracker and
Itinerary. For each of the different feature, _TravEzy_ gives you a walkthrough of what statistics you can see for
each feature when you are at the achievements page itself.

=== Interface

Navigating around the achievements interface:

==== Logic Component
.AchievementsLogic Diagram of the Achievements feature
image::AchievementsLogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/achievements/logic/AchievementsLogic.java[`AchievementsLogic.java`]

The `AchievementsLogic` is responsible for generating statistics for the different components in Travezy

.  `AchievementsLogicManager` uses the `Supplier<StatisticsModel>` to supply the `StatisticsModel`.
. Getting the `StatisticsModel` from the `Supplier<StatisticsModel>` constructs a new `StatisticsModel` that gets the statistics data from a Model from another feature e.g. `AddressBookModel` that is visible within `ModelManager`
. `AchievementsLogicManager` returns the resultant data from the `StatisticsModel` that is lazily created.

The `AchievementsLogic` parses `Command` as well to enable navigation to other `Page` within Travezy.

.  `AchievementsLogicManager` uses the `AchievementsParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `AchievementsLogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

[NOTE]
The `StatisticsModel` does not allow mutations and is immutable. Passing the `StatisticsModel` into `AchievementsLogic` does not mutate the original `StatisticsModel`

[TIP]
Generate a new `StatisticsModel` to reflect the newly updated data from each logic by supplying a new `StatisticsModeL` from the
`StatisticsModelSupplier` in `AchievementsLogic`

Given below is the sequence diagram for generating the `StatisticsModel` lazily:
