    "description": "From the \u2018Clean Hands' campaign to the heightened use of biometrics, the body has become a crucial site for political action, decision, and judgment. As a result, corporeal registers\u2014 facial expressions, phenotype, movement, affective expressions, etc.\u2014are now vital markers of difference, determining the degree to which one is recognized as \u2018friend\u2019 or \u2018enemy\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019 or \u2018innocent\u2019, \u2018citizen\u2019 or \u2018foreigner\u2019. Organized around three prominently figured bodies\u2014the tortured body, the racialized body, and the veiled body\u2014in the post-9/11 global landscape and its current 'War on Terror', this module examines the ways in which the body is situated and implicated in relations of power, sovereignty, identity, and violence.",
