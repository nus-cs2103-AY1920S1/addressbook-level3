    "description": "In this module students will learn that art does not exist apart from society. What is considered art is determined by ideas within a particular time period and social institutions. Furthermore, art is not only about the artist. As a social activity, art making involves elaborate cooperation among specialised personnel. Giving focus to visual art and using examples from Southeast Asia and beyond, topics covered include gender in the arts; governments, economies and religion in shaping the arts; artists and their art making as well as social dimensions of aesthetic experience and interpretation of art works.",
