== Introduction

Insurelytics is for insurance agents who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and policies*.
More importantly, Insurelytics is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Insurelytics can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-4/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listpeople`* : lists all people
* `add n/John Doe ic/S9999999J p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 dob/12.09.1980 g/Male`: adds person
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd person shown in the current list
* *`listpolicy`* : lists all policies
* `addpolicy n/Senior Care d/care for seniors c/months/10 pr/$50000 [sa/50 ea/75]`: adds policy
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Tutorial

Insurelytics is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for insurance agents like yourself to manage your contacts and policies. Here is a quick tutorial to help you get started using the application!

You can use Insurelytics to manage two different kinds of data: *persons* and *policies*. The formats in which these
types of data are stored are as follows:
====
* Person:
** Name (e.g. "Alice Pauline")
** NRIC (e.g. "S0000001J")
** Phone number (e.g. 94351253)
** Email address (e.g. "alice@example.com")
** Date of birth (e.g. "12 December 1982")
** Gender (e.g. "Female")
** Tags (e.g. "nonsmoker, high blood pressure")
** Policies (e.g. "Life Insurance, Health Insurance")
====
====
* Policy:
** Policy Name (e.g. "Senior Care")
** Description (e.g. "Insurance for elderly")
** Coverage (e.g. "12 years, 0 months, 0 days")
** Price (e.g. "$5000")
** Start age (e.g. "50")
** End age (e.g. "75")
** Tags (e.g. "term insurance")
** Criteria (e.g. "nonsmoker")
====

These two sets of data are displayed on the two main pages of our application, the person page and the policy page.
They can be accessed via their respective display commands `listpeople` and `listpolicy`.

First, let's navigate to the person page and add a contact.
```
listpeople
add n/John Doe ic/S9999999J p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 dob/12.09.1980 g/Male
```

Then, let's navigate to the policy page and add a policy.
```
listpolicy
addpolicy n/Senior Care d/Care for seniors c/days/20 months/11 years/5 pr/$50000 sa/50 ea/75
```

Persons can be `assign`-ed policies that they are eligible for. A person is eligible for a policy if
he/she falls in the specified age range and possesses all the policy's specified criteria (in his/her tags).

```
assignpolicy 1 pol/Life Insurance
```

[NOTE]
One of our design features is to allow users to use person-related commands on the policy page and vice versa (as with
the example above).

Persons and policies can easily be retrieved using the various `find` functions, whether by *keyword* or by *tag*.
Let's find a person and add a "senior" tag to the person.

```
find John
addtag 1 t/senior
```

[IMPORTANT]
Note that the index of `addtag` refers to the resulting list from the previous `find` command. Indices of persons
are always based off the latest view of the person page. The same applies for policies.

The various functions outlined in the following section are available to further help the user manage contacts and policies.
These include additional functions to help the user gather insights, rectify mistakes and validate input among others.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

[NOTE]
To edit tags, use `addTag` or `deleteTag`

Example:
```
edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com
```

Considering the first person is `Alex Yeoh`, sample output is:
```
Edited Person: Alex Yeoh
NRIC: S0000001A; Phone: 91234567; Email: johndoe@example.com; Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40; Date of Birth: 12 December 1998; Gender: Male

=== Editing a policy : `editpolicy`

Edits an existing policy in the address book. +

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* If editing a policy's details results in it being ineligible for person(s), the policy is *not* unassigned from the corresponding people.
The reason behind this is that the relevant people signed the policy before the terms were changed, hence they should still be holding
the previous version of the policies they signed.
****
[NOTE]
To edit policy tags, use `addPolicyTag` or `deletePolicyTag`

Example:
```
editpolicy 1 d/Honda Insurance p/$10000 sa/25 ea/80
