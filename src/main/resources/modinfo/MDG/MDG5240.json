The team-based project, from solving a real-world clinical health issue to commercialising the product or process, must be relevant to industrial and clinical areas. Students will work in small teams on a project which must be approved by the module coordinator before thay are allowed to proceed. The students should identify a supervisor/mentor who is willing to oversee the projects and obtain their approval before submitting the proposal for consideration.",
