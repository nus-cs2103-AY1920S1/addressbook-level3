The focus of study will be key texts from the late Republican era (c. 70-30 BC): selected portions of a prose speech of the orator and politician Cicero, and select poems of Catullus. As well as gaining a deeper understanding of the syntax and grammar of Latin \u2013 and a greater awareness that language is resistant to static \u2018rules\u2019 \u2013 students will develop an increased cultural knowledge in Roman late Republican society and literary production.",
