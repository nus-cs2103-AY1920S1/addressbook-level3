    "description": "In the contemporary world, philosophy is one academic discipline among many. But throughout its history, philosophy has also been conceived as a way of life. This course will explore this alternative conception of philosophy by exploring pre-modern Greco-Roman and Chinese models, and contemporary reflections on the philosophical life. Topics include the relation between theoretical discourse and one\u2019s lived life; philosophy and living well;philosophy as a way of life and 'religion'; protreptic arguments for pursuing philosophy; therapeutic arguments; spiritual exercises; and the extent to which this conception of philosophy remains viable today.",
