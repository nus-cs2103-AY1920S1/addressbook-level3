== PROJECT: T.A.rence

Hi there, I'm _Ellie_. I am currently pursuing a double major in Real Estate and Computer Science at National University of Singapore (NUS). +
I love to build practical applications that can help with our day-to-day activities.

== Overview

T.A.rence is a class management system for teaching assistants in NUS. Given that many students in NUS serve as TAs and take up multiple +
classes in 1 semester, this application will allow for a smoother management process. T.A.rence is designed to be a simple and intuitive
application that allows users to interact by typing the commands using the Command Line Interface. In addition, T.A.rence also comes with a
clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) that presents information in an organized manner.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major Enhancement*: added *GUI enhancement and GUI commands*

==== All GUI enhancements and displays shown in T.A.rence, list, displayAttendance, displayAssignmentScore, listAssignment, changeTab

* Summary of the features:
** Allows the user to generate graphs and view the various information such as students, tutorials, modules, attendance and assignments to be displayed in a easy-to-understand form.
** Summarizes data such as assignment scores into multiple formats (graph and table) to allow different ways of understanding the data.
** Commands such as changeTab also allows the user to change the view of T.A.rence purely using the command line

* Justification:
** These features compresses the large and complex data pool stored within T.A.rence to be observed by the user in easily understandable formats.

* Highlights:
** This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. Given the large variety of data structures used to store information in T.A.rence, an in-depth analysis of display formats and design alternatives were
considered in the process.
** The implementation too was challenging as it required to work with a variety of data structures, so as to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of data processing.
** Given the many layers of information contained within T.A.rence, information had to carefully extracted without compromising other related systems.

* Credits:
** Attendance table generation code was adapted from the following link: {https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41771098/how-to-plot-a-simple-double-matrix-into-tableview-in-javafx}

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Implemented the find command to allow users to find students based on their name
** Implemented shortcut format for addStudentCommand to allow users to add students into tutorials based on their index instead of having to type out both the tutorial and module name.
