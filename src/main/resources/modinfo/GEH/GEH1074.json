    "description": "This module aims to highlight how luck has influenced and still influences several aspects of the world we live in. From the beginning of the universe, to our present-day lives, to the end of the universe, random events beyond anyone\u2019s control continue to shape our fate. By exploring the various fields that luck manifests itself in, the module ultimately delves into the intriguingly precarious nature of existence.",
