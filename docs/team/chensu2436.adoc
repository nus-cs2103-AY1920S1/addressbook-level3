== PROJECT: Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)

'''

== Overview

**The Module Appeal Management System (MAMS)** is a desktop appeal management app for module appeal administrators.
MAMS aims to fuse a Command Line Interface (CLI) style command input with a triple-pane GUI for easy navigation of appeals, module information, and student
particulars all in a single display.
MAMS provides a complete suite of tools for intuitive navigation of the comprehensive data display and
resolving appeals (_for feature details, please refer to User Guide_).
MAMS is written primarily in Java, and features a GUI created with JavaFX, with CSS used to augment the GUI for improved user experience. It has about 13 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1: added the ability to check clashes for various cases*
** What it does: allows the admin to check timetable clash in appeals requesting to add or drop modules, between 2 modules or in a student's current timetable
** Justification: Checking timetable clash is one of the most important checks that an admin needs to perform before he/she decides to approve or reject an appeal.
This feature improves the user experience significantly because it provides a convenient way for the admin who needs to perform such checks constantly.
** Highlights: There are a few types of check that can be performed. Therefore, the user inputs for this command can take various forms.
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives is required to deal with these variations.

* *Major enhancement 2: enhanced the find command that allows the user to search in different lists*
** What it does: allows the admin to search multiple keywords in multiple lists at the same time
** Justification: There are a huge number of appeals, modules and students given the size of the university.
This feature provides a convenient way to locate items which the admin wants to look for.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects other commands since it will be used together with other commands often.
For example, to filter all appeals requesting to add a particular module and check clashes in one go.
