    "description": "Understanding the interplay of Public Administration, Technology and Innovation is the object of this course, and its aim is to stay at the 'top of the game' and therefore to be capable of dealing with this key aspect of the public sphere today. What is the relationship between PA and Technology \u2013 which drives the other, what are the motives and interests involved, does cultural context matter, are there any choices, and is the specific PA model relevant? Should the bureaucracy innovate itself or promote business innovation? And should the focus be on the future or on the present?",
