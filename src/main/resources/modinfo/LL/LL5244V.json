    "description": "The administration of criminal justice in Singapore relies on an ethical, professional and skilled disposition and management of criminal cases. A good criminal practitioner needs a sound grounding in criminal law and criminal procedure, and a strong base of written and oral advocacy and communication skills. This is an experiential course that takes students through a case from taking instructions all the way through to an appeal, using the structure of the criminal process to teach criminal law, procedure and advocacy skills. Taught primarily by criminal law practitioners, this course will give an insight into the realities of criminal practice.",
