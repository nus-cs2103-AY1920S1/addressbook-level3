== Introduction

CS ModBuddy is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for planning their modules*.
More importantly, CS ModBuddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CS ModBuddy can get your module planning done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `csModBuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your module plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add SEMESTER MODULE_CODE`, `SEMESTER`
is a parameter which can be used as `add y1s1 cs1101s`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `newplan [TITLE]` can be used as `newplan`
or as `newplan Algo and Graphics`.
* Items with ... after them can be used multiple times e.g. `TAG_NAME...` can be used as `core`, `core completed`, etc.

=== Storage

==== Creating a new study plan: `newplan`
Creates a new study plan with an optional title. +
Format: `newplan [TITLE]` +
Examples:

* `newplan`
* `newplan noc half year`
* `newplan minor in maths`

==== Deleting a study plan: `removeplan`
Deletes a study plan with a given index. +
Format: `removeplan PLAN_NUMBER` +
Example:

Examples:

* `commit planned until y2s2`
* `commit haven’t added UEs`

==== Checking commit history: `history`

==== Viewing a commit: `viewcommit`
Shows the version of the current study plan for a particular commit.This does not discard the commits after the
specified commit. +
Format: `viewcommit COMMIT_NUMBER` +
Example:

* `viewcommit 1.1`
* `This allows the user to view commit 1 of study plan 1.`

==== Reverting to a commit: `revert`
Reverts to the version of the current study plan for a particular commit. This creates a new "revert" commit and
returns the current active study plan back to the state in the specified commit. +
Format: `revert COMMIT_NUMBER` +
Example:

* `revert 1.1` +
Suppose there are commits `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, and `1.3`. This allows the user to revert to commit 1 of study plan 1,
creating a new commit called `1.4: Revert "COMMIT_MESSAGE_OF_1.1"`.

==== Deleting a commit: `deletecommit`
Deletes a commit in the current active study plan specified by the commit number. +
Format: `deletecommit COMMIT_NUMBER` +
