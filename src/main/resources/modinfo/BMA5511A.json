    "description": "This is a course meant for two important marketing mix variables, Channel Management and Pricing. Channels are a dominating power in the marketing chain. Compared to other strategic elements of marketing, channels differ in at least three ways:\n\u2022\tlong term impact of channel related decisions; \n\u2022\tthe existence and implications of channel \u2018power play\u2019; \n\u2022\tthe market dynamics caused by channel changes such as the internet.\n\nThis course is designed to help students to systematically analyze the various channel functions and strategies. The one element of marketing strategy that is malleable but least understood is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.",
