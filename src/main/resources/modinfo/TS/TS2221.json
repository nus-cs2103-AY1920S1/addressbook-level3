    "description": "This module introduces theatrical histories and theories across a variety of global traditions. As a broad overview, this module juxtaposes significant traditions to think through how theatre is related to its historical context, how theory has arisen from or shaped practice, and how history itself is constructed by historians. Students will investigate a variety of forms including those transmitted through oral, embodied, and text-based methods.",
