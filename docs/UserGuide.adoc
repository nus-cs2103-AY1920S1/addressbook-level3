== Introduction

StudyBuddy Pro specifically caters to students in the School of Computing at NUS
that prefer to use a desktop app to help their studies.
StudyBuddy is also optimized for those who prefer to work with
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). Being highly familiar working with CLI,
Computing Students can greatly benefit from the app to
manage their studies efficiently which also aims to be faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

To begin, download the latest version of `StudyBuddy` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W13-3/main/releases[here]
and double-click the downloaded jar file. If double-clicking does not work, please follow the instructions below.

=== Running the jar file

==== For cross-platform users
* Open your PC's terminal/command prompt
* Type java -jar StudyBuddyPro.jar

==== For Windows users
* Open your PC's terminal/command prompt
* Type java -jar StudyBuddyPro-Win.jar

==== For Mac users
* Open your PC's terminal/command prompt
* Type java -jar StudyBuddyPro-Mac.jar

== Command Format / Rules

Things noted here are standardization of the User Guide.
These points are absolute, unless stated otherwise in the specific section(s).

****
* All commands are written in ENGLISH with only alphanumeric characters.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
E.g. `add t/TITLE` -> `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Midterm notes`.

* Items indicated in square brackets are optional.
E.g `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/Midterm note tag/exam` or as `t/Midterm`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
E.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family`

* All flashcards, notes, and cheatsheet objects can have a maximum of 10 `TAGs` each.

* All `MODULE` parameters in the flashcard feature are `TAGs`.

* In EDITING (`edit`):
** All optional fields provided, except `tag/TAG`, will overwrite their relevant fields.
** `tag/TAG` optional field, will be added to the flashcard, if they do not already exist.

* In DELETING (`delete`), Confirmation reply of `y` or `n` has to be given, else no objects is deleted.
** `y` indicates `YES` and notes will be deleted.
** `n` indicates `NO` and notes will not be deleted.

* Any indexes (`id`) must be positive integer (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...).
The indexes refers to the index number shown in the displayed list of objects (e.g. flashcards, notes, cheatsheets, tags).

* Only exact matches of any searches will be returned.
E.g. "noted" will return "noted" but not "note" or "notes"

* All searches are case insensitive.
E.g. 'cs2103t' will match 'CS2103T'
