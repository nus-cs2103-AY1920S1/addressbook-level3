    "description": "Ideas fuel politics and politics structures the world of ideas. To engage\neffectively in these worlds requires a grasp of the political concepts that\nengender consensus and conflict. This course uses history of ideas, legal\ndocuments, and contemporary philosophy to introduce students to core\nconcepts that scaffold institutions and practices (e.g., democracy,\nauthoritarianism, republicanism, socialism) as well as concepts which shape and are shaped by those institutions and practices (e.g., power, empire,\norder, liberty, equality, right). Using a case\u2010based approach in class, we\nexplore how political conflict and action grow from contestations over the\nmeanings and consequences of these concepts.",
