== 1. Introduction

---

The purpose of the portfolio is to document my roles and contributions to the project in terms of code, the user and
developer guides.

=== 1.1 Overview

In a team of 5 software engineering students, we were tasked to enhance a basic command line interface desktop
addressbook application for our software engineering project. We chose to morph it into a watchlist for movie and
television series called EzWatchList.

My role was to design the code for the `search` feature and ensure proper documentation of the code in general. I had
to implement the `search` feature such that users would be able to search within the watchlist and from online. The
code had to be refactored and the `search` command had to be modified to allow users to search for different
categories such as searching by name or actor.

=== 1.2 About EzWatchList

EzWatchList is a desktop application, designed for those who types fast and prefer to work with Command Line
Interface (CLI) for managing movies and television series watchlist. It helps users keep track of the shows they had
watched or wish to watch, reducing the hassle of having to search for shows frequently.

line and executed by the application.
| (different front/colour text) | This indicates that it is a class, method or field in the code.
