Elements of performance-making, such as characters, character journey, motivation, goals, obstacles, circumstances, etc. will be introduced and applied to guide students to develop a performance-making project. Self-awareness and reflective thinking will be emphasized and cultivated throughout the development of the student\u2019s project. This acts as an introductory course for other theatre/performance courses in the A&H Major.",
