It combines the discussion of these matters of law with international relations theory and issues of judicial policy. Against the background of a mounting stream of international judicial decisions, students will develop a solid analytical framework to appreciate the law and politics of international judicial institutions, focusing on the International Court of Justice, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the World Trade Organization, and adjudication in investment disputes.",
