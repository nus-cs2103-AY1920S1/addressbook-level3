    "description": "A broad range of diverse technologies, including information\nprocessing, computing, communications, control and\nelectronics can be applied to our transportation and\nsystems. The combination of these technologies, known\ncommonly as intelligent transportation systems (ITS),\nenables engineers to effectively manage transportation\nproblems at the system level. The topics covered in this\nmodule include state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art\nsystems and technologies in rapidly progressing ITS\nresearch and development. This module enables the\nstudent opportunity acquiring the knowledge and practical\nskills through the lectures, field investigations, and course\nprojects.",
