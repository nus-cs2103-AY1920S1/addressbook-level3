== PROJECT: VISIT
'''
=== Introduction

*VISIT* is a *Java-based Desktop application*, made for doctors as an open-source, paper-free alternative to traditional patient management systems. The workflow of the application is centralized around users who can type fast and are comfortable with Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs).

*VISIT* mainly allows you to add and manage patient information, visitation and appointment details among other features, maintaining the key features doctors need in a patient management system.

.VISIT User Interface (UI)
image::Ui.png[width="900"]

Originally a fork from the AddressBook3 from Team SEE-DU, my team UnrealUnity and I have developed VISIT over a period of 2 months, with the codebase currently standing around ~16k LoC in size. The following .asciidoc serves to document my various contributions to the project throughout the development of VISIT.

=== Summary of contributions
This section categorizes my various contributions into its relevant sections towards the development of VISIT.

==== Major Enhancement
Added the *Profile* feature to VISIT.

- *Purpose*: Allows the user to *visualize all attributes of a patient* (Name, Address, etc.) as well as all relevant visitation reports in an *easy to access Profile Panel*. Profiles can also be *exported into .txt files*.
- *Justification*: This feature greatly enhances the way Doctors visualize patient data in VISIT as detailed information is available at a single glance. This is often needed when archiving or referencing a patient's previous details during consultation.
- *Highlights*: This feature requires interacts with existing and concurrently implemented data structures of VISIT. This required deep knowledge of the existing codebase and close collaboration with other members of my team in order to ensure that the feature works seamlessly with the rest of the features in VISIT.

==== Minor Enhancements
* Enhanced the intuitive use of the `find` command to filter Patients by their names, even if the query was a partial match.
* Added a pleasant and modern landing page for GitHub repository (See https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-2/main/blob/master/README.adoc[README.adoc]).

=== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|_The section below is an excerpt from VISIT's User Guide, detailing the additions that I made to document the Profile enhancement, showcasing my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== *Viewing and Generating a Patient's Profile*

VISIT allows you to visualize a specified patient’s full details on an easy to access panel. The command can be initiated as follows:  +
Format: `profile INDEX`

****
* Shows full profile for the patient at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …
****

==== *Opening a Profile Window:* : `profile`
*Step 1*: Enter in `profile 1` into the command bar and press kbd:[Enter].
[.text-center]
image::UGProfile0.png[width="450"]

*Step 2*: A pop out panel will appear, detailing the various attributes of the specified Patient.

[.text-center]
image::UGProfile1.png[width="450"]

This window includes all Patient attributes and visitation records.

[WARNING]
You must close this window before doing anything else with VISIT (Adding Visits, Deleting Patients, etc.).

*Closing the panel* +
Clicking on the cross on the top-right of the panel or pressing kbd:[esc] button on your keyboard will close the panel.

==== *Generating and Exporting a Profile as a .txt file*

You can generate a text file containing the contents of the Patient's Profile, for your own archiving purposes and exporting.

*Step 1*: Press kbd:[p] on your keyboard or click the kbd:[Generate Profile File] button.

[NOTE]
You will see a message saying "_Profile .txt created in /generated_profiles/_." once the Profile has been successfully generated.

*Step 2*: Navigate to the _generated_profiles_ folder located in the parent folder of _VISITapp.jar_

[.text-center]
image::UGProfile3.png[width="500"]

*Step 3*: Access the generated profile stored in the folder.

[.text-center]
image::UGProfile4.png[width="400"]

[NOTE]
The generated text file will be the following format: _Name_Contact Number_Date Time.txt_ e.g. _Alex Yeoh_87438807_02-11-2019 20-33-58.txt_


Below is an example of a generated profile .txt file:

[WARNING]
While files are write-protected, you can still create duplicate copies for editing. Data encryption and safer data handling is planned for VISIT v2.0 (See https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f12-2.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#Upcoming-Features[Upcoming-Features]).

=== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_The section below is an excerpt from VISIT's Developer Guide, describing the implementation of the Profile enhancement in VISIT. This demonstrates my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
|===

=== Profile feature

==== Implementation

The *Profile feature* allows the user to be able to *see the full details of the patient* as well as all relevant visit information (See https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f12-2.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#visitImplementation[Visit Report Feature]) from a single panel. Attributes of the patient is extracted from the `Person` instance, including the `Name`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Tags` and `VisitList`. The Profile feature also enables users to *export the Profile as a read-only text file* for archiving.

===== *Profile Panel Implementation:*
_The displaying of the patient profile panel is mainly facilitated by the following components:_
****
- `ProfileWindow` - Displays the relevant information of the Patient on the Profile Panel.
* `#setup` - On invocation, populates the Panel with the given `Person` instance.
- `ProfileCommand` - Instantiated when the command is parsed by `ProfileCommandParser`.
* `#execute` - Extracts the Person from the current model.
- `ProfileUtil` - Utilized during `ProfileWindow#setup` to translate the various `Person` attributes to `Strings` (stringify).
****
Given below is a simple example usage scenario demonstrate how Profile feature behaves and interacts with the other components:

*1*. The user executes `profile 3` command view the profile of the 3rd person shown in VISIT's current list. This is parsed as a `ProfileCommand`, which is then executed.

*2*. The `Person` instance from the filtered Person list from the current `model` and returns a `CommandResult` with the `Person` instance as an attribute.

*3*. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` is then executed, calling `ProfileWindow#setup()` which populates the hidden Profile Window with the attributes of the `Person` instance before `MainWindow#handleProfilePanel()` is called to show the Profile Window to the user.

*[4]*. In this optional step, users can choose to export the Patient's Profile as a .txt file by pressing the `p` key or clicking on the _Generate Profile File_ button on the UI. The implementation of this is detailed in the next section.

*5*. After viewing the relevant information, the user presses the 'esc' key which closes the form. This causes an event handler in `ProfileWindow` which listens for a `KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED` event where the event code equates to `KeyCode.ESCAPE` ('esc' key) to trigger, which hides the profile window.

.Activity Diagram for Step 4-5

[NOTE]
The user is able to close the `ProfileWindow` form by clicking the 'x' on the top right of the form as well.

This sequence diagram fully shows what happens when a user executes the Profile Command:

[.text-center]

===== *Profile Generation Implementation:*
_The patient profile generation functionality is mainly facilitated by the following components:_
****
- `ProfileWindow` - Serves as origin for invoking the `GenerateProfileCommand` using `#generateProfilePressed`.
- `GenerateProfileCommand` - Instantiated by `ProfileWindow` with the relevant `Person` attributes.
* `#execute` - Uses `FileUtil` and `ProfileUtil` to build the contents of the Profile .txt file and create it in the relevant directory.
****

The following is a scenario to illustrate the behaviour of how this functionality works:

*1*. The user presses the `p` key or the _Generate Profile File_ button on the Profile Panel. This invokes the `generateProfilePressed()` in `ProfileWindow`.

*2*. This generates a new `GenerateProfileCommand` instance relating to the `Person` that `ProfileWindow` is currently on. This command is then executed using the same `LogicManager` as `ProfileWindow`.

*3*. The executed command uses `FileUtil` to generate the parent file (_generated_profiles_) if it has not been created.

*4*. `ProfileUtil` is invoked to assemble a `String` containing the entire content of the `ProfileWindow` in a presentable manner.

*5*. `FileUtil` is then called again to generate a read-only .txt file containing the file content. A `CommandResult` indicating success is the propagated back to `ProfileWindow`.

*6*. Upon success, a small message is generated next to the _Generate Profile File_ button on the Profile Panel.

This simplified sequence diagram summarizes the critical interactions between ProfileWindow, GenerateProfileCommand, FileUtil and ProfileUtil:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Profile shows the information from the patient in ProfileWindow
`ProfileWindow` currently uses the `Person` class as its data structure to access all the relevant information on the Profile Panel. This presents some design considerations as listed here:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not create an explicit `Profile` class to store the Profile data.
** Pros: Easy to implement, more straight forward implementation. Defensive copies of Person can be used instead of a explicit `Profile` class which contains the exact same field variables as a Person.
** Cons: May cause dependency issues as this increases coupling, with relation to the Profile and Patient class.
* **Alternative 2:** Create an explicit `Profile` class, which is instanced every command call.
** Pros: Decreases coupling by cutting down on the direct calls to the `Person` instance.
** Cons: Adds to bloat in code structure, as it is very similar to `Person` class. We must ensure that the `Profile` instance generated is correct every time.
