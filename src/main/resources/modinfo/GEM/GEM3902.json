    "description": "The Independent Study Module (ISM) provides an opportunity for senior undergraduates who are staying at the College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) to do independent critical reading or research work. Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study programme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at CAPT must be inter-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, or trans-disciplinary in topic and/or approach. Student and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study, evaluation, and other pertinent details. The ISM is a graded module.",
