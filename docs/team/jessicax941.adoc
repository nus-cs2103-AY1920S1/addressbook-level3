== PROJECT: GuiltTrip

== Overview

Craving for a nice bowl of Mala but canâ€™t seem to save up enough for it? guiltTrip() is the perfect platform for those
*aspiring to be able to afford their Mala*, finally!

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to customise the look of UI*

** What it does: allows the user to toggle specific panels on and off, change the font and theme of the application. The font and theme settings are also saved.

** Justification: This feature improves the product by a moderate degree as it gives the user ability to change the look of the GUI to their liking. Because these settings are saved, when the user launches the application again, it is already in the user's preferred settings. As we are targeting young people who often like to customise the look of their applications (light/dark theme, type of font used), we believe that making the GUI customisable will draw our target users in and encourage them to continue using the application.

** Highlights: This enhancements supplements some of the existing commands as it allows the user to view other entries such as Budgets, Wishes and AutoExpenses or not to view them, by toggling those panels off.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** Implement specific `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands for Expense and Income to maintain consistency (previously was one `add`/`delete`/`edit` command for both Expense and Income while Wish, Budget, AutoExpenses had their own commands).

** Improve `listBudget` and `listWish` to replace budgets/wishes with expenses and incomes in the main panel. Thus this allocates more space for the user to view budgets or wishes, whenever the user wants to.

=== UI features

==== Toggle Panel : `toggle`
Toggles visibility of the specified panel on the GUI. Only the following inputs are accepted:

* for wishlist panel: `wishlist`/`wishes`/`wish`/`w`
* for budget panel: `budgets`/`budget`/`b`
* for reminders panel: `reminders`/`reminder`/`r`
* for auto expenses panel: `autoexpenses`/`autoexpense`/`autoexp`/`ae`

Format: `toggle <panel name>`

Examples:

* `toggle wishlist`
* `toggle ae``

Example usage:

Step 1. If user does not want to view the wishlist panel all the time, he could choose to execute the `toggle wishlist` command as shown below.

.. He could refer to the panel names in the result display box above when typing in the input panel name.

==== Change Font : `changeFont`
Changes the font used in application to the specified font. The input is case-sensitive. Only the following font names are accepted:
"arial", "calibri", "cambria", "candara", "garamond", "georgia", "rockwell", "segoe UI", "serif", "verdana". The available fonts to change to will be shown in the result display box for the user to refer to easily. The change in font will be saved.

Format: `changeFont <font name>`

Examples:

* `changeFont rockwell`
* `changeFont segoe UI`

Example usage:

. User changes the font by executing the `changeFont rockwell` command as shown below.

.. He is also able to refer to the available font names in the result display box above.

=== UI component

.Structure of UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

* The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

* The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/guilttrip/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.

=== Toggle Panel Command

==== Implementation

.Partial class diagram showing only the classes in `UI` involved in the Toggle Panel Command.
image::PartialUiClassDiagramForToggle.png[]

The `toggle` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the `CommandResult` obtained from `Logic`
if the user wants to toggle a specified panel. If so, it toggles the `isVisible` and `isManaged` properties of the place
holder for that panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how an example usage scenario `toggle wishlist` would work:

.Interactions inside the Logic and UI components for the `toggle wishlist` command
image::ToggleSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram is as explained below:

. The user launches the application and executes the `toggle wishlist` command to toggle the `wishlist` panel.
. `commandResult` is obtained in `MainWindow` after the command is parsed and executed.
. `MainWindow` checks if the `togglePanel` attribute in `commandResult` is true.
. Since it is true, it retrieves the `PanelName` `WISH` from `commandResult` and calls on its own method `handleTogglePanel`.
. This method then calls on another method `togglePanel()` that toggles the panel and takes in the `PanelName` `WISH` as a parameter.
.. (Not shown in sequence diagram to reduce its complexity) It also checks if the wishlist is already shown in the main panel.
.. If it is, then a `CommandException` is thrown to prevent the user from toggling the wishlist side panel when the wishlist is already shown in the main panel.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `toggle` command:

.Activity diagram showing what happens when user executes a `toggle` command
image::ToggleActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current method):* Toggle the panels from within `MainWindow`.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: Might not be as OOP as other designs.

* *Alternative 2:* `MainWindow` has a `PanelManager` class that manages all the side panels (toggling them on and off).

** Pros: More OOP, reduces number of methods and lines of code in `MainWindow`.

** Cons: May introduce cyclic dependency between `PanelManager` and `MainWindow`.

=== Change Font Command

==== Implementation

The `changeFont` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the
`CommandResult` obtained from `Logic` if the user wants to change the application font.
If so, it immediately changes the font without requiring the user to exit and launch the application again.

[NOTE]
This change in font is also saved in `UserPrefs`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an example usage scenario `changeFont rockwell` would work:

.Interactions inside Logic and UI components for the `changeFont rockwell` command
image::ChangeFontSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram is as explained below:

. The user launches the application and executes the `changeFont rockwell` command to change the current application font to _rockwell_.
. `commandResult` is obtained in `MainWindow` after the command is parsed and executed.
. `MainWindow` checks if the `changeFont` attribute in `commandResult` is true.
. Since it is true, it retrieves the `FontName` `ROCKWELL` from `commandResult` and calls on its own method `handleChangeFont`.
. This method then converts the `FontName` `ROCKWELL` to a `String "rockwell"` and sets the `font-family` attribute of `window`, that contains all the child nodes, to `rockwell`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `changeFont` command:

.Activity diagram showing what happens when user executes a `changeFont` command
image::ChangeFontActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Change the application font from within `MainWindow`.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: May not be as OOP as other methods.

* *Alternative 2:* Use a separate class to control the theme, such as `ThemeManager`.

** Pros: More OOP, reduces amount of code in `MainWindow`.

** Cons: As the implementation is not very complicated, introducing a new class just to change the theme may not be worth the increase in dependency (introduces dependency between `Theme` and `ThemeManager` and between `ThemeManager` and `MainWindow`).

=== Set Light/Dark Theme Command

==== Implementation

The `setLightTheme`/`setDarkTheme` command extends from the `Command` class. `MainWindow` checks using the `CommandResult` obtained from `Logic` if the user wants to change the theme of the application.
If so, it immediately changes the theme without requiring the user to exit and launch the application again.

[NOTE]
This change in the application theme is also saved in `UserPrefs`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an example usage scenario `setLightTheme` would work:

.Interactions inside Logic and UI components for `setLightTheme` command
image::SetLightThemeSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram is as explained:

. The user launches the application and executes the `setLightTheme` command to change the current theme to _light_.
. `commandResult` is obtained in `MainWindow` after the command is parsed and executed.
. `MainWindow` checks if the `changeTheme` attribute in `commandResult` is true.
. Since it is true, it retrieves the `newTheme` from `commandResult`, `LIGHT`, and calls on its own method `switchThemeTo(LIGHT)`.
.. (Following details were trivial and thus omitted from the diagram) This method retrieves the URLs for the light theme and corresponding extensions css files and adds it to the stylesheets for the scene.
This is done after removing the stylesheets for the previous theme.
. This implementation is essentially the same for `setDarkTheme` command, with the `newTheme` as `DARK` instead.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `setLightTheme` command:

image::SetLightThemeActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Change the theme from within `MainWindow`.

** Pros: Easy to implement.

** Cons: May not be as OOP as it could be, increases number of lines of code in `MainWindow`.

* *Alternative 2:* Use a separate class to control the theme, such as `ThemeManager`.

** Pros: Abstracts out the methods regarding changing of theme to be contained in `ThemeManager` and reduces the number of lines of code in `MainWindow`.

** Cons: Harder to implement; may introduce cyclic dependency.
It may also be redundant or excessive as implementing the `changeFont` command is not very complicated.
