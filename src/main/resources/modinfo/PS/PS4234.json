    "description": "This is a course that explores the origins, reproduction, and effects of social identity from a variety of perspectives. The sources of identity that are investigated include the self, group, society, and state, as well as their more complicated combinations. The identities whose origins, maintenance, and effects we study are nation, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, and race. The approaches we take to make sense of identity politics include writings in political science, social psychology, sociology, history, anthropology, and cultural and post-colonial studies.",
