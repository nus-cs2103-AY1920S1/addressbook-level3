    "description": "This module is an introduction to creative writing. Weekly classes offer students structures and stimuli to discover and develop their creativity. The module provides a large practical component, aimed at helping students generate and develop a portfolio of work across the strands of fiction, poetry and script writing. Students will explore aspects of character, storyline, dialogue, structure, narrative voice, tension, style, endings and point-of-view in writing. Over the semester, students will learn various techniques relevant to their writing, share their ideas and work-in-progress, explore different approaches through writing exercises, and discuss working practice.",
