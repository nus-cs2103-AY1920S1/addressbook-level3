    "description": "The concept of social capital has gained popularity, both in sociology and outside the academia globally. The theoretical basis of social capital is that resources embedded in social relations affect the life chances of individuals and collectivities. It has also been argued that social capital has a significant impact on occupational mobility, civic engagement, social movement, and economic development. The module will explore (1) the theories of social capital, (2) the empirical work on social capital, (3) linkages between social capital and instrumental and expressive actions, (4) new directions for research extension of the theory of social capital.",
