    "description": "World War I unleashed a dramatic wave of global revolution. Imperial authority was challenged all over the world. But in the early 1920s the first onrush of revolution was halted. A new, liberal order took shape that was anchored on America and Britain\u2019s global power. It was this, which triggered a new generation of ultra\u2010radical insurgents whose challenge to the status quo would bring on the extreme violence of the 1930s and 1940s. Students will be introduced to the key actors and thinkers of this drama, ranging from Lenin and Gandhi, to Woodrow Wilson, Maynard Keynes, Hitler, Stalin and Mao.",
