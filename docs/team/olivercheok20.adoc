== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *features to enable searching for people/policies for various specialized purposes*
** What it does: allows the user to search for people/policies according to different purposes (current policyholders,
potential policyholders, potential policies, by tag, by partial keyword), notably by *eligibility*.
** Justification: insurance agents are likely to have many different people and policies in their contact list. To make
information retrieval as fast as possible, different specialized search functionalities are important. In particular, the
eligibility-related search functions are useful for the insurance agent in deciding who to approach to sell what policies.
** Highlights: The way of implementing eligibility is not trivial, as we need to find a way to map people to a boolean
value given a policy, and vice versa. The chosen design of the underlying implementation of criteria as tags is an elegant
solution which makes intuitive sense to the user. In addition, the use of `Predicate` to implement list filtering makes
future extensions convenient and simple.

* *Minor enhancement*: Create partial keyword search for people and policies.
