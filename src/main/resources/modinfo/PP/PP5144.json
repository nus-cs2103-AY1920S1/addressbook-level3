    "description": "This course introduces the main tools of game theory and decision theory through short cases borrowed from the current economic, political and business scene. It examines how these tools might lead us to make better decisions, from both an individual and a collective viewpoint; especially it introduces the biases and mistakes that were documented in the psychological literature, and examine their relevance to decision making. It explores the extent (and limitations) of rationality in individual and collective decision making, and characterizes normatively the outcome of such decisions. Examples from everyday life, sport, military operations or political conflicts will be used to illustrate the reach of game theory and decision theory as tools for strategic analysis.",
