== PROJECT: ExerHealth

== Overview

ExerHealth is a desktop application that is created by me and another 4 Computer Science students. It
enables users to track important information about their exercises and also provides other functionality such as
the ability to create their own fitness regimes and the ability to provide statistical analysis of their activities.
Users can also define their own properties which they wish to track for their exercises.

Below is a screenshot of our application:

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: Provided a feature that *allows user to define their own custom properties* and *remove them*.

** What it does: Users can simply add in or remove their own custom properties should they wish to keep track of extra/lesser properties
for each exercise.

** Justification: This feature provides greater flexibility among various users if they wish to include more information which they wish to track. This customisation can help users to
tailor suit the app for their personal use.

** Highlights: This feature complements well with the suggestion feature. By having
custom properties, users can now produce exercise suggestions based on the custom properties they had created. Furthermore, the implementation of this feature is
quite challenging as there are a few aspects to take note of: the representation of custom properties in each exercise, the tracking of custom properties that have been created
and storage of custom properties.

* *Minor enhancement 1*: Added a `viewcustom` command that allows user to view the custom properties that they have defined.

* *Minor enhancement 2*: Designed the centre panel UI for exercises. This design helps to display both the default and custom
properties of each exercise to the user.

* *Minor enhancement 3*: Added a `select` command that allows user to select a specific exercise/regime/schedule/suggestion
which they wish to view.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=weihaw08&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Code Contribution]]
