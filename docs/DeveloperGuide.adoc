== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteStudent 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteStudent 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::architecture[]

The sections below give more details of each component.
// tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tarence/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
// end::ui[]
// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component (for regular commands only)
image::LogicRegularCommandClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tarence/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ApplicationParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteStudent i/1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteStudent i/1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Besides these main commands, `Logic` also handles autocorrect and autocomplete functions in response to user input. These are described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 respectively.
// end::logic[]
// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tarence/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed'
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutorial>` that can be 'observed'
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed'
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
// end::model[]
// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `T.A.rence` application data in json format and read it back.

==== Implementation
When the application is being saved, a list of modules will be serialized into a Json object and written to the file.

==== Design Considerations
Although the application has 3 core components (modules, tutorials and students), to prevent redundant data being written
and save on storage space, only the modules will be serialized and saved.

This is as the information encapsulated in modules can be used to instantiate tutorial and student objects.

A key assumption here is that during the operational usage of the application, data stored in the tutorials and students objects
correspond to the module object. Ie there are no tutorials or student objects which exist without a corresponding
module object.

Future versions of storage will support saving of Assignment objects.
// end::storage[]
[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.tarence.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::Add Student Feature[]
=== Add Student feature

The `AddStudent` command lets T.A.rence add a student into the specified module and tutorial.

==== Implementation

The `AddStudent` command must include the name, email, tutorial and module. The tutorial and module can be indicated by the index of the tutorial. Optionally, the user
can also choose to indicate the student's matric number and nusnetid.

[NOTE]
If the user uses both the indexing and full input format, the command will throw an error due to ambiguity.

* The `AddStudent` command will also automatically be updated within the application's storage system and the new student will be reflected in the application's GUI.

Below is an activity diagram shows the process of invoking the `AddStudent` command.

image::AddStudentCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction with the Logic components as described above.

image::AddStudentCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::Add Student Feature[]
// tag::edit[]
=== Edit feature

The `edit` feature aims to help users update student details in our application.
When there are changes to be made for a student (e.g. updating their email or adding a matric number),
users will want to be able to update their student's details easily without going through the hassle of deleting and adding new student information.

==== Implementation

The `edit` command must include one of the following:

* Name
* Email
* Matric number
* NusnetID

[NOTE]
The user is not allowed to change the tutorial or module that the student is in.

* The `edit` command will also automatically be updated within the application's storage system and the new student's details will be reflected in the application's GUI.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction with the Logic components as described above.

image::EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How edit executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes old copy of and adds new modified copy
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time complexity.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify the existing version of the student directly.
** Pros: Will use less memory
** Cons: Will have to go through each of the student/tutorial/module lists and update them. Which involves many layers of looping (higher chance of regressions).
// end::edit[]
// tag::autocorrect[]

=== Autocorrect feature

Autocorrect lets T.A.rence find similar commands to the user's input, allowing it to catch minor typing mistakes.

.Structure of the Autocorrect portion of the Logic component
image::LogicAutocorrectClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation

Autocorrect is implemented at the `Command` level: when `Command` objects are executed, they attempt to find their data values from the application's storage. If these values are not found, they search for lexically similar alternatives, and construct new `Command`s with these suggested values. The user is then prompted to choose one of these suggestions via a single numerical input.

A new `SelectSuggestionCommand` is used to represent the user's selection. Unlike other commands it has no keyword, and can only be triggered when there are existing suggested commands being temporarily cached. Should the user choose not to pick any of the options, the cached commands are deleted and can no longer be triggered subsequently.

Autocorrect is restricted to input fields that are not strictly numerical, since it makes no sense to correct, for example, index or time inputs.

Below is an activity diagram showing the creation of suggested autocorrect commands when a command is executed.

image::AutocorrectActivityCreate.png[]

The suggested commands are presented to the user, each tagged with an index number. The user is prompted to select one option by entering its corresponding number.

image::AutocorrectActivityExecute.png[]

When a valid option is selected, the `execute()` method in `SelectSuggestionCommand` retrieves the specified command, then calls its `execute()` method. The sequence diagram below illustrates a sample run of the program where `AddStudentCommand`s are being autocorrected.

image::AutocorrectSequence.png[]

NOTE: The lifelines for `SelectSuggestionCommand` and `AddStudentCommand` should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.
// end::autocorrect[]
// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete feature

Autoomplete provides an autofill feature similar to that found in most common CLIs.

.Structure of the Autocomplete portion of the Logic component
image::LogicAutocompleteClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation

Autocomplete is implemented at the `Parser` level. When the user presses the "TAB" key, `AutoCompleteHandler`  handles the processing of the input, as opposed to `ApplicationParser` when the "ENTER" key is pressed.

`PartialInputParser#parse` is responsible for the actual parsing of the input string. It calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeLastArgument` to find only the last present prefix and its associated value, then uses the appropriate method in `Finder` to get a list of all values corresponding to the prefix type in the application that begin with the detected partial input. Should this prefix be one not supported by Autocomplete (e.g. `i/` for a purely numerical input), an error message is shown to the user.

`AutocompleteHandler#handle` is responsible for determining the correct autofilled string. If the user presses "TAB" multiple times successively, it cycles through the available autofill options; otherwise, it gets the list of options from `PartialInputParser` and returns the first one. The activity flow is summarised below:

image::AutocompleteActivity.png[]
// end::autocomplete[]
// tag::list[]
=== list feature

The `list` command lets T.A.rence display all students or students from a specific tutorial.

==== Implementation

The `list` command can include no additional input, or the index of the tutorial. When the user executes the `list` command, the following steps are taken by the application:

* The CommandParser determines the format of user input. If not input is provided, all students are displayed.
* When the `list` class is invoked, it will perform the following actions before displaying the output to the user:
* Obtains a list of tutorials from the model and filters through the students which belong to the indicated tutorial of choice.

Below is an activity diagram shows the process of invoking the `list` command.

image::ListCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction with the Logic components as described above.

image::ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::list[]
// tag::MarkAttendanceFeature[]
=== Mark Attendance feature

The `MarkAttendance` command lets T.A.rence mark the attendance of a specified student in a tutorial.

==== Implementation

The `MarkAttendance` command must include the following:

* The week of the tutorial
* Tutorial name
* Module code

Alternatively, the index of the tutorial can be used in place of the tutorial name and module code.
Optionally, the user can also choose to indicate the student's name.

[NOTE]
If the user uses both the indexing and full input format, the command will throw an error due to ambiguity.

* The `MarkAttendance` command will also automatically be updated within the application's storage system and the updated attendance will be reflected in the application's GUI.

Below is an activity diagram showing the process of invoking the `MarkAttendance` command.

image::MarkAttendanceActivityDiagram.png[]

The MarkAttendanceCommand has two formats, the first with a student's name specified and the other without. Specifying the student name will toggle the attendance of the student in the tutorial, while the other format will mark/toggle the attendance of the entire tutorial sequentially.
For the second case, the application will prompt the user to mark/toggle the attendance of each student in the tutorial one by one.
Errors will be thrown if the tutorial/module/student cannot be found, or if the week specified is invalid.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between the Logic componenents for marking the attendance of a single student.

image::MarkAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png[]

Entering the input will call the execute() method in LogicManager, which identifies the command as a MarkAttendanceCommand via ApplicationParser.parse(). MarkAttendanceCommand.parse() is then called to parse the input and extract the relevant information (tutorial name, module code, student name) which is used to initialize the MarkAttendanceCommand, which finally modifies the student's attendance when executed.
// end::MarkAttendanceFeature[]
// tag::undoredo[]

=== Undo feature
The undo feature allows the user to undo multiple commands at once.

==== Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `JsonStateStorage`.
It extends `TARence` with an undo history, stored externally as a `stateXX.json` file
where 'XX' represents the sequential state of json files committed.

It relies on the following operations from Storage, exposed via the `Storage` interface.

* `Storage#isValidNumberOfRollbacks(Integer numberOfStatesToUndo)` -- Checks if the specified number of undo commands
to execute is valid.

* `Storage#getLatestStateIndex()` -- Obtains the largest state stored. Used to obtain the
state number which is required.

* `Storage#getSpecifiedState()` -- Obtains the required state to reset the model to.

* `Storage#saveApplication()` -- Saves the application state into `application.json`. This method additionally calls
`JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()`, which is explained below.

It relies on the following operation from Model, exposed via the 'Model' interface.

* `Model#setModel(`ReadOnlyApplication`)` -- Resets the model to the supplied application state.


Additionally, it relies on the following operation from  JsonStateStorage, not exposed via the Storage interface:

* `JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()` -- Saves the current application state to file if there is a change in state.
The files are saved as `stateXX.json`, where the file name is chronologically generated.

* `JsonStateStorage#stateStack` -- A private attribute, which keeps track of the current and
previous states. Its implementation is similar to the `currentStatePointer` used in AB4.


These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `JsonStateStorage` will be initialized with the initial json file, `state1.json` and the `stateStack` will contain the value `1`.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `addModule m/CS2103` command to add the module `CS2103`
in the application.

The `addModule` command calls `Storage#saveApplication()`, which calls
`JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()`,
causing the modified application state, after the `addModule m/CS2103` command
executes, to be saved externally in the `data/states` folder.

The latest state number `(stateStack.peek() + 1)` is pushed onto the stack, which
corresponds with the json state file saved.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `addTutorial tn/Tutorial 01 ...` to add a new Tutorial. The `addTutorial` command also calls `JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()`.

As `JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()` detects that there has been a state change with the latest saved state (`state0.json`),
the modified application
state is saved externally to the `data/states` folder.

The `stateStack` is correspondingly updated (The latest state number `(stateStack.peek() + 1)` is pushed onto the stack, which
corresponds with the json state file saved.)

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `storage#saveApplication()`, so the
application state will not be saved.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the tutorial, `Tutorial 01` was a mistake, and decides to undo that action
by executing the `undo` command.

The `undo` command will first verify that the number of commands is valid by calling
`storage#isValidNumberOfRollbacks`.

If the number of undo commands is valid, it will call `storage#getLatestStateIndex` to
get the position of the current state pointer (which is the number on the top
of stateStack).

The `undo` command will then call `storage#getSpecifiedState()` to retrieve the desired
state to undo from. In `storage#getSpecifiedState()`, the internal `stateStack` will
pop the numbers until it gets to the required state number, to ensure that it
the "pointer" is at the correct state.

With the desired state retrieved, `undo` command will call `model#setModel(application)` to
reset the application to the retrieved state.


image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `stateStack.peek()` is at index / integer 0, pointing to the
initial application state,
then there are no previous application states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `storage#isValidNumberOfRollbacks(number of states to undo)`
to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listAssignments`. Commands that
do not modify the address book, such as `listAssignments`, will not result in a saved state.

`JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()` is still called. However, since there is no change with
the previous state, `JsonStateStorage#saveApplication()` will not save the current application state.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations


===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire application state into Hard Drive.
** Pros: Won't result in performance issues if there are many states as it won't use up valuable RAM.
** Cons: May have performance issues when reading the file from Hard Drive if the json file is large.
** Cons: Suppose that "undo u/50" is executed, from state 70. State 20 will be loaded into memory.
Subsequent states (ie state 21 onwards) will only overwrite the already present state 21 file.

The redundant states are not deleted from the hard disk. Only references to those states
,which is in the stateStack, are removed. However this is a minor problem as once the
application is closed or started, it will automatically clear any state files.

* **Alternative 2:** AB3 suggested implementation: Saves the entire application state into RAM.
** Pros: Easy to implememnt.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteTutorial`, just save the tutorial being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands



* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a stack to store the history of application states.
** Pros: Eliminates redundancy as previous states not needed will be overwritten.
** Cons: Leftover files of undone states are present in the hard drive.

* **Alternative 2 (better choice):** Use a stack as in Alternative 1.
When `undo` command is executed, in addition to popping the stack, the application will
delete the corresponding json files. This reduces the likelihood of accidentally reading
redundant data.

* **Alternative 3 (AB3 choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.

* **Alternative 4:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo.
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

. Number of module and tutorial slots created should be of reasonable amount (< 10)
. The application’s functionalities should be easily testable.

=== Constraints:
. System should be wholly usable by <<CLI, C.L.I>>. (No <<GUI, G.U.I>> -only functionality)
. The application should work without requiring an Internet connection.

=== Technical Requirements:
. Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.

=== Performance Requirements:
. System should be able to hold up to 100 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

=== Quality Requirements:
. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands)
should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
. The application should work even if the user enters partial commands/data and data in
different formats, or omits certain command prefixes.
. Product should be usable by someone who just became a Teaching Assistant.
