== Introduction

ModuleBook is a standalone application that tracks and manages modules from National University of Singapore (NUS). The application contains many features useful for module management, such as deadline tracking and hyperlink storage.

ModuleBook is for NUS students who want a desktop app for managing modules. More importantly, ModuleBook is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ModuleBook can manage your tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `modulebook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all modules.
* **`add`**`cs2103t` : adds a module with module code `cs2103t` to be tracked by ModuleBook.
* **`delete`**`cs2103t` : deletes tracked module with module code CS2103T from the list of tracked module if the module exists.
* **`deadline`**`cs2103t`**`d/complete UG and DG`**`t/time` : adds deadline to module with code 'cs2103t'
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Return from module view: `back`
Returns from the module view.

Format: `back`

// end::moduleview[]

// tag::addFindDelete[]
=== Finding an archived module: `find`

==== Method 1: Using command lines
Find archived modules with the the given prefix and keyword. +
Format: `find PREFIX\ KEYWORD ...`

[NOTE]
It is possible to use any number or combination of filters. Prefixes not present will not be considered in the search.

****
* Prefixes: (case sensitive)
** `all\` : List all the modules. *Overrides* all other prefixes.
*** Example: `find mod\ cs all\`, `all\` will override `mod\` and list all the modules.
** `mod\` : Find all modules with *module code* that contains *at least one* of the given *keyword(s)*.
*** Example: `find mod\ cs ma st` will list all modules with module code containing `cs` *or* `ma` *or* `st`.
** `title\` : Find all modules with *title* that contains *all* of the given *keyword(s)*.
*** Example: `find title\ software engineering` will list all modules with titles containing `"software" *and* "engineering"`.
** `desc\` : Find all modules with *description* that contains *all* of the given *keywords(s)*.
*** Example: `find desc\ software engineering` will list all modules with description containing `"software" *and* "engineering"`.
** `prereq\` : Find all modules with *prerequisites* that match *at least one* of the given *keyword(s)*.
*** Example: `find prereq\ cs2030 cs2040` will list all modules with prerequisite of `cs2030` *or* `cs2040`.
** `preclu\` : Find all modules with *preclusion* that match *at least one* of the given *keyword(s)*.
*** Example: `find preclu\ cs2030 cs2040` will list all modules with preclusion of `cs2030` *or* `cs2040`.
** `sem\` : Find all modules offered in a particular sem 1 - 4. (Sem 3 and 4 are special terms 1 and 2).
*** Example: `find sem\ 1 3` will list all modules offered in semester 1 *or* special term 1.
* The prefixes can be used together in any order to filter modules that passes all the search requirements.
** Example: `find mod\ cs2 cs3 desc\ software engineering sem\ 1` will show all modules with module code containing `cs2`
*or* `cs3` with description containing `"software"` *and* `"engineering"` offered in semester 1.
* The keywords are case insensitive. e.g `cs2103t` will match `CS2103T`.
* *Keywords* used in *title\* and *desc\* are tolerant of minor *spelling mistakes*.
** Example: `find desc\ enginering` will display results similar to `find desc\ engineering`.
* Search is performed using string matching, commonly used keywords will therefore produce many search results.
* Invalid prefixes and keywords before a valid prefix will be ignored.
** Eg: `find INVALID\ invalidKeyword mod\ cs` the `INVALID\ invalidKeyword` will be ignored, `mod\ cs` will be searched.
****
[NOTE]
Keywords are searched using *"OR"* relation (apart from `title\` and `desc\` which uses an *"AND"* relation.) while predicates are seached using
*"AND"* relations.
For example, `find mod\ cs ma title\ linear algebra` will produce results of all modules with (module code containing `cs` *OR* `ma`) *AND* (title containing `linear` *AND* `algebra`)

==== Method 2: Using GUI

Alternatively, you can simply click on the search button on the top left hand corner (shortcut key: F2) and select search. Input your
keywords in the fields provided within the popup.

=== Adding a module: `add`

Adds a module to be tracked. +
Format: `add MODULE_CODE`
****
* The add is case insensitive. e.g `cs2103t` will match `CS2103T`.
* Only module code is searched for module to be added.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `cs2103` will not match `cs2103t`.

// end::deadline[]

// tag::link[]

=== Manage links in modules: `link`

Link commands are only available when viewing a module and only valid on currently displayed tracked modules.

NOTE: Before you use any `link` command, make sure you are viewing your desired course module first.

TIP: If you happen to forget any of the url paired with the names you have entered, simply hover over the button and the information will be displayed.

==== Adding link to module: `link add n/LINK_NAME l/LINK_URL`

You can use this command to add a link with the given name to a selected TrackedModule. This is useful if you manage to come across an important website related to a certain module you are currently taking and wish to note it down. A button will be created in ModuleBook with name you specified.

Suppose you are taking CS2103, and you will frequently visit the course website to check for new updates or tasks to complete by the next milestone. You wish to put the link somewhere so you can access it easily and also manage them effectively. You can do so using the following steps:

. Enter the command. Make sure you are viewing the CS2103 module.

image::userguide/AddLinkStep1.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]

[start=2]
. Press Enter. You should see a new button created in the Links section and a success message.

image::userguide/AddLinkStep2.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]

==== Editing existing link: `link edit n/LINK_NAME [nn/NEW_NAME nl/NEW_URL]`

You can use this command to edit the name and/or url of an existing link.

Suppose the name "Nusmods Timetable" is too long and you want to change it to just "Nusmods". It is very simple to achieve:

. Enter the corresponding command

image::userguide/EditLinkStep1.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]

[start=2]
. Press Enter. The link should be updated with the new name and a success message should appear.

image::userguide/EditLinkStep2.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]

==== Launching the link: `link go n/LINK_NAME`

You can use this command to access a link in the default browser of your system.

NOTE: If you are using any lesser known operating system, the app may not be able to detect it and this feature may not work as intended.

Now suppose you wish to access a link you provided previously (from the `add` command). Doing that is very simple:

. Enter the command `link go n/Course Website`

. The website should open in the default browser of your system and a success message should display.

TIP: Alternatively, you can access the link by clicking on it through the GUI as well.
// end::link[]

==== Deleting a link: `link delete n/LINK_NAME`

You can use this command to delete a link with a matching name in the given module.

Suppose you have no use for a link to Nusmods in the module and you want to remove it to de-clutter. You can remove it by:

. Enter the delete command

image::userguide/DeleteLinkStep1.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]

[start=2]
. Press Enter. You should see a success message and the link should be gone.

image::userguide/DeleteLinkStep2.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]
// tag::link[]

==== Marking/unmarking a link: `link mark/unmark n/LINK_NAME`

Some links may be more important than others, and you may access them more frequently. To keep track of that, you can mark them using the `mark` feature.

Suppose you go to the course website of CS2103 very often and want to make sure you can identify the link immediately, mark it so it stays at the front all available links:

. Enter the command `link mark n/Course Website`

image::userguide/MarkLinkStep1.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]
[start=2]
. Press Enter. The specified link will now be marked with a symbol and brought to the front of the list.

image::userguide/MarkLinkStep2.png[][pdfwidth="50%",width="50%"]

// end::link[]
