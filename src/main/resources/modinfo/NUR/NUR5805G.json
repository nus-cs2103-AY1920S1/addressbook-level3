    "description": "This module aims to prepare students to function and excel in the rapidly changing landscape of wound care practices in community setting. Students will use the approach of realist review to develop structurally coherent explanations of wound interventions when applied in diverse context. They will unpack the relationships between context, mechanism and outcomes (abbreviated as C-M-O) and explore on how and why a particular wound intervention works or does not work in complex situation. During the work-based practice, student will have the opportunity to further develop and apply knowledge and skills learnt in this module.",
