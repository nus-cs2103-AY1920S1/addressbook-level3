It will cover the rise of the major media industries in postwar Japan, trace the development of particular TV and news genres in response to societal changes; identify broad cultural and linguistic patterns in media texts; and interrogate notions of transnational cultural flow using Japan's popular media as a case study. Lectures will draw on materials from TV archives, magazines, comics, news articles and film footage, and other media-related sources. Tutorials will be conducted in &quot;workshop&quot; style in which students will be expected to work with first hand Japanese media materials.",
