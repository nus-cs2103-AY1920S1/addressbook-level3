== Introduction
Mortago is a mortuary management system for hospitals. This developer guide serves as a documentation of the interactions with Mortago. As a developer, you will be able to gain a better understanding of how Mortago works.

This developer guide is organised in a top-down approach, starting with Architecture Design. You may jump to any section by clicking on the heading in the contents page.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -b 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete -b 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BodyListPanel`, `WorkerListPanel`, `FridgeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a body).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -b 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -b 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Body>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save Mortago data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag:uniqueIdentificationNumber[]
=== Unique Identification Number

In Mortago, each entity is assigned a unique `IdentificationNumber`.

* `IdentificationNumbers` in Mortago consist of two parts: the `String typeOfEntity` referring to whether it is a worker, body or fridge, and `Integer idNum` referring to its unique ID number.
* Each `IdentificationNumber` is automatically generated within the application, based on the next sequential ID number available.
* The generation of unique `IdentificationNumbers` allows the user to identify different entities solely based on their `IdentificationNumber`, without relying on attributes such
as `name` which may have similar duplications within the system.

==== Implementation

The generation of unique `IdentificationNumbers` is facilitated by `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps`.
The class diagram below illustrates the relation between `IdentificationNumber` and `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps`.

.Unique `IdentificationNumber` Class Diagram
image::UniqueIdentificationNumberClassDiagram.png[]

===== The first consideration to examine is determining the next free number.

Note that in the diagram above, `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps` keeps three `HashMap`, one for each entity.
In each `HashMap`, the `Integer` ID number serves as the key, which maps to the entity it is assigned to.
This keeps track of the numbers currently assigned to all entities and allows the next free `Integer` to be assigned to a newly added entity. +

The code snippet below demonstrates how the next free number is determined.

----
    private static Integer putWorker(Worker worker) {
        Set<Integer> keys = uniqueWorkerMap.keySet();
        int numOfKeys = keys.size();
        for (int id = 1; id <= numOfKeys; id++) {
            if (uniqueWorkerMap.get(id) == null) {
                uniqueWorkerMap.put(id, worker);
                return id;
            }
        }
        int newId = numOfKeys + 1;
        uniqueWorkerMap.put(newId, worker);
        return newId;
    }
----

In the above `putWorker` method, the set of `keys` representing the existing ID numbers are generated and iterated through, based on the size of the `keySet`.
This sequential iteration checks for any number that is not assigned to any worker (i.e. gap) due to a prior deletion of its assigned worker, which removes the mapping of the ID number to the deleted worker.
If there is an existing gap in the sequential iteration of numbers, this number is assigned to the newly added worker.
If there is no gap available, the next highest number is assigned to the worker.

===== Hence, this leads us to forumulate the execution sequence of generating a unique `IdentificationNumber` for a worker:

. The user executes `add -w /name Zach ...` to add a new worker to Mortago.
. `AddCommandParser` parses the given input and calls the `Worker` constructor.
. In the constructor, the worker's `IdentificationNumber` is created using `IdentificationNumber::generateNewWorkerId()`.
. Consequently, `generateNewWorkerId()` creates a new `IdentificationNumber`, where the number is determined after the execution of `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps::addEntity()`.
. `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps::addEntity()` subsequently calls `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps::putWorker()`, which inserts the worker into the worker `HashMap` and returns an ID number that is currently not assigned to a worker.

The figure below illustrates the sequence diagram of the aforementioned steps.

.Generation of unique `IdentificationNumber` Sequence Diagram
image::UniqueIdentificationNumberSequenceDiagram.png[]

Note that the execution sequence is similar for the generation of unique `IdentificationNumber` for fridges and bodies.

==== Design Considerations

When designing this feature, it is important to keep in mind the scalability of the application.
When the data set becomes large, the ID number can become arbitrarily large if gaps in the middle are not filled.

*Aspect: Tracking of numbers and determination of next free number*

* Alternative 1: Three counters that track the total number of each entity in the system and assigns the next highest number to the added entity.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
** Cons:
*** Does not cater for deletion of entity as deletion creates a gap which will be left unfilled.
* Alternative 2 (current choice): A `HashMap` keeping track of the ID numbers and their respective assigned entity.
** Pros:
*** `HashMap` allows its `keySet` to contain unique ID numbers.
*** `HashMap` caters for deletion of entities as the `keySet` can be iterated through to check for any gaps introduced during deletion.
*** `HashMap` also allows the assigned (mapped) entity to be made accessible via the O(1) `HashMap#get()` method.
** Cons:
*** Harder to implement, especially for unit testing since a unique `IdentificationNumber` cannot be duplicated usually.

Alternative 2 is chosen due to the comprehensive benefits of utilizing `HashMap` in terms of:

* Tracking of unique keys
* Catering for deletion of ID numbers and filling of the gap
* Increasing the ease of accessibility of mapped entities

The difficulty in testing can be circumvented by executing `UniqueIdentificationNumberMaps::clearAllEntries()`
before each unit test to reset the `HashMaps`. This resets the `HashMaps` and allows the newly added entities to start with the first ID number, simulating a fresh launch of the application.
// end::uniqueIdentificationNumber[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
The undo/redo feature allows you to undo a command that you have made or redo a command you have undone.

==== Implementation

You can find the core of undo/redo in the undo/redo history of [purple]`ModelManager`.
The history stores [purple]`UndoableCommands`, and an [purple]`UndoCommand` or [purple]`RedoCommand` will [purple]`undo()` or [purple]`redo()` commands in the history.
The design of [purple]`UndoableCommand` uses the Command pattern, a common design pattern often used in software engineering.
It allows each individual command to be undone/redone at a high-level without needing the specific command type to be known.
Classes related to undo/redo and their relationships are shown in Figure 11.

.Class Diagram Showing the Architecture of Undo/Redo
image::UndoClassDiagram.png[]

===== Architecture

To start off, you will find two instances of [purple]`CommandHistory` in [purple]`ModelManager`. They are  stored internally as [purple]`commandHistory` and [purple]`undoHistory`.
[purple]`commandHistory` stores previously executed commands while [purple]`undoHistory` stores previously undone commands.
[purple]`CommandHistory` wraps a [purple]`Deque<UndoableCommand>`. Its methods imposes a [purple]`MAX_SIZE` which determines how many commands can be stored in the command history.

In [purple]`ModelManager`, four key operations to access and modify [purple]`CommandHistory` are implemented:

* [purple]`ModelManager#addExecutedCommand(UndoableCommand command)` -- Adds a command that was executed to the start of [purple]`commandHistory`.
* [purple]`ModelManager#getExecutedCommand()` -- Removes the last command that was executed and added to [purple]`commandHistory` and returns it.
* [purple]`ModelManager#addUndoneCommand(UndoableCommand command)` -- Adds a command that was undone to the start of [purple]`undoHistory`.
* [purple]`ModelManager#getUndoneCommand()` -- Removes the last command that was undone and added to [purple]`undoHistory` and returns it.

In the [purple]`Model` interface implemented by [purple]`ModelManager`, these four operations are respectively exposed as
[purple]`Model#addExecutedCommand(UndoableCommand command)`, [purple]`Model#getExecutedCommand()`, [purple]`Model#addUndoneCommand(UndoableCommand command)`, and [purple]`Model#getUndoneCommand()`.

Next, the [purple]`UndoableCommand` stored in the [purple]`Model` is actually a normal [purple]`Command` that changes program state.
The [purple]`UndoableCommand` class is an abstract class that extends the abstract [purple]`Command` class, as shown in Figure 11. Commands like [purple]`AddCommand` or [purple]`UpdateCommand` extends [purple]`UndoableCommand` instead of [purple]`Command`.
Commands that don't change the user-visible program state, like [purple]`FindCommand`, can still inherit directly from [purple]`Command`.

Here is where the Command pattern comes in. A class extending [purple]`UndoableCommand` must implement an additional method, [purple]`UndoableCommand#undo(Model model)`. This means that every child class of [purple]`UndoableCommand` has a custom `undo` implementation.

[purple]`UndoableCommand#redo(Model model)` is a concrete implementation of the `redo` mechanism and is inherited by all child classes.

Lastly, undo/redo is initiated when user input creates an [purple]`UndoCommand` or [purple]`RedoCommand`. When either of them are executed, they respectively get the last
executed or undone command from the [purple]`CommandHistory` in [purple]`ModelManager`. As the retrieved command is an instance of [purple]`UndoableCommand`, an attempt will be made to execute [purple]`UndoableCommand#undo(Model model)` or [purple]`UndoableCommand#redo(Model model)`.
If it is successful, undo/redo is succesful. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

This is the mechanism of undo/redo, from start to end.
Below is an example of a usage scenario to help you visualise how undo/redo works.

The sequence diagram below shows how an undo command works to undo a [purple]`ClearCommand`:

.Sequence Diagram Showing a ClearCommand Being Undone
image::UndoClearSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Defensive programming
To defend against improper undoing or redoing, an [purple]`UndoableCommand` can only be added to the [purple]`commandHistory` or [purple]`undoHistory` of [purple]`ModelManager` through its [purple]`execute()` or [purple]`undo()` method.
Additionally, [purple]`UndoableCommand` contains a small inner class, the enumeration [purple]`UndoableCommandState` which allows an [purple]`UndoableCommand` to have its state set to any value in the enumeration.
The values are as shown below.
----
    /**
    * Enumerates through the possible states of an UndoableCommand.
    */
    public enum UndoableCommandState {
        UNDOABLE, REDOABLE, PRE_EXECUTION
    }
----

Before a command is undone or redone, the command's state is checked for validity. An example is shown below in the [purple]`redo()` method.
----
    /**
     * Re-executes an UndoableCommand if it had been previously undone.
     */
    public CommandResult redo(Model model) throws CommandException {
        if (getCommandState() != UndoableCommandState.REDOABLE) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_NOT_UNDONE_BEFORE);
        }
        return execute(model);
    }
----
As shown in the code snippet, when an [purple]`UndoableCommand` is redone, the method first checks that its state was set to [purple]`UNDOABLE`.
These states are only changed when a [purple]`Command#execute(Model model)` or [purple]`UndoableCommand#undo(Model model)` has successfully executed.
Therefore, it is unlikely that an [purple]`UndoableCommand` will be unwittingly undone or redone in error.

If a `redo` command was executed afterwards, the [purple]`ClearCommand` would simply be executed again.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a new [purple]`UndoableCommand`. In this case, it is the [purple]`ClearCommand` being undone. The control flow is similar for other [purple]`UndoableCommands`; they only differ in the execution of [purple]`undo()`.

.Activity Diagram Showing the Execution Control Flow of a Command
image::CommandProcessActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

When designing the undo/redo feature, scalability and speed were the key considerations.
There was also an extra layer of difficulty as Mortago has automated commands that are both time-based and user-triggered.
After the analysis described below, the Command pattern was thought to be the best solution.

===== Aspect: Designing the undo/redo mechanism
Alternative 1 was chosen despite its difficult implementation because it is faster and more scalable.

* **Alternative 1:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros:
    *** Better scalability. Will use less memory (e.g. For `add`, only the added entity needs to be saved).
    *** Faster for big programs.
    *** Easier to implement defensive measures.
** Cons:
    *** Must implement custom undo functions for each command.
    *** More difficult to implement and maintain.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the whole program state.
** Pros:
    *** Easy to implement and maintain.
** Cons:
    *** Likely to use a lot of memory.
    *** Slower for big programs.

===== Aspect: Handling automated timed commands
Mortago has a Notification feature, which are user-triggered automated commands that are triggered by time.
Though the undo/redo feature does not support it directly, the Notification can make changes to
program state at any time. When undoing or redoing, it was essential that data integrity was preserved.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it causes almost no overhead, guarantees data integrity, and causes the user the least inconvenience.

* ** Alternative 1:** Allow automated commands to be undone
** Pros:
    *** Causes minimal overhead as only one additional command needs to be stored.
    *** Maintains data integrity.
    *** Allows the user to undo automated changes, if it is not desired.
    *** Shows consistency and will not cause visual jumps between states.
** Cons:
    *** Confuses the user initially.

* ** Alternative 2:** Do not undo the automated command
** Pros:
    *** Easiest to implement.
** Cons:
    *** Confuses the user initially.
    *** Causes visible jumps between states (e.g. The user might see changes to 2 fields being undone even though his `update` command only changed one field).
    *** Loss of data integrity.

===== Aspect: Storing executed/undone commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store [purple]`UndoableCommand`(s) only.
** Pros:
    *** Logic can be reused for both executed and undone commands.
    *** Easy to implement.
    *** Uses less space.
** Cons:
    *** Loses some information about [purple]`Commands` that were previously executed.
* **Alternative 2:** Store all [purple]`Commands`.
** Pros:
    *** No loss of information.
** Cons:
    *** Harder to implement. Requires differentiating between commands that have been undone and executed commands.
    *** Needs extra space to store non-[purple]`UndoableCommand`(s) even though they are useless for undo/redo.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Notification Feature
This feature in Mortago reminds a mortuary manager to contact the police when the next-of-kin of a body
has not been contactable for a given period of time from the point of admission of the `Body`. He / She then needs
to
contact
the police
to
proceed with a
more thorough investigation. In Singapore, this period is 24 hours. For testing purposes, it has been set to
10 seconds in Mortago.

If the status of a `Body` is `ARRIVED` after 10 seconds, it is updated to `CONTACT_POLICE` and a
pop-up alert is displayed to remind the user.

[TIP]
If you want to change the time period, you can do so by modifying `NOTIF_PERIOD` and `NOTIF_TIME_UNIT` variables in
AddCommand.java.

==== Implementation

This command is supported by the model component `Notif` and the logic component `NotifCommand`.

In `Notif` command, the following are the key private variables:

* `body`: Refers to the `Body` for which the `Notif` is created. This is passed in as a parameter when a new
instance of the class is instantiated.

* `alert`: Refers to a `Runnable` function which checks if the current status of the body is `ARRIVED` and if so,
changes it to `CONTACT_POLICE`.

* `notifCreationTime`: Refers to a `Date` object which stores the date and time at the point of addition of the body.

The constructor of a `NotifCommand` must be provided with the following parameters:

* `notif`: Refers to the instance of the `Notif` which is handled by the `NotifCommand`.

* `period`: Refers to a `long` value for which the NotifCommand needs to wait before executing the `alert` function
of the `notif`. `long` is used because `notifCreationTime.getTime()` returns a `long` which is useful in storage.
It will be explained in further detail later. Currently, this value is set to `10`.

* `timeUnit`: Refers to a `TimeUnit` associated with the `period`. Currently, this value is set to `TimeUnit.SECONDS`.

The following class diagram (Figure 14) models the relationships and dependencies among classes in this feature:

.Notification Class Diagram
image::NotifCommandClassDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagrams (Figure 15 and 16) illustrate the execution of the notification feature:

.Notification Command Sequence Diagram
image::NotifCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

.ChangeUI function Sequence Diagram
image::ChangeUiFnSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user adds a new body and a `NotifCommand` is
instantiated:

.Notification Command Activity Diagram
image::NotifCommandActivityDiagram.png[]


|===
a|[TIP]
*Is `NotifCommand` only executed when a `Body` is added?*
a| No! If the status of the `Body` is changed to `ARRIVED` using the `UpdateCommand`, `NotifCommand` is still
executed. The `Notif` is scheduled to be executed after the specified `period` from the point in time when the
status of the body was updated.
|===

===== Storing executed and pending `Notifs`
`NotifCommand` supports storage where each `Notif` with its associated `Body` and the `long` equivalent of the
`notifCreationTime` is stored in a JSON file along with the other `Entities`. When the `MainApp` is initialized, the
following happens:

1. All the `Notif` (s) are fetched from the storage.
2. For each `Notif`, the difference of the  current <<System-Time, system time>> and `notifCreationTime` is calculated.
3. If the difference is more than the `period`, then the status of the associated `Body` is
changed to `CONTACT_POLICE`. Otherwise, the `NotifCommand` is scheduled to be executed after the calculated time difference.
4. The `Notif` is added to the model.

|===

a|[TIP]
*When is the `NotifCommand` not executed?*
a|* If the status of the `Body` is changed before the 10 second window.
* If the `Body` is deleted before the specified `period`.
* If the difference between `notifCreationTime` and system time is more than `period` when the app is initialized.

|===

===== Defensive programming

The `NotifCommand` heavily makes use of the `ScheduledExecutorService` and `Platform.runLater(Runnable runnable)` to
make changes to the `Body` status and `Notif`. They use threading to allow tasks to be handled concurrently. For instance,
even after scheduling a `Runnable` function, the user is still able to carry on with other commands of Mortago such
as updating the status of the `Body`, adding a new `Fridge` etc.

As per the official Java Documentation, `Platform.runLater(Runnable runnable)` runs the specified runnable function
on a thread dedicated to JavaFX application at some unspecified time in the future. So,
if some updates to the model are wrapped inside it as a `Runnable` while others are not, it can result in a
mismatch of model. For instance, you may want to delete a `Notif` which already exists in the model. The usual
process will be to first check whether it exists and if it does, then proceed with deletion. However, due to
threading, you may end up in a situation when the app finds the `Notif` at the point of checking but throws a
`NullPointerException` when proceeding with the deletion.

To prevent this, in Mortago, any addition or deletion of `Notif` in the model during the execution of the
`NotifCommand` and parts of `UpdateCommand` are wrapped inside `Platform.runLater(Runnable runnable)`. This ensures
that updates to the model happen sequentially and not concurrently and the relevant changes can be reflected on the
UI.

Moreover, all these operations are wrapped inside a try-catch block. Either the `NullPointerException` or
`DuplicateNotifException` is directly thrown in the form of `CommandException` or it is logged in `Logger`. A
code snippet of `NotifCommand` to illustrate this is show below.

```
 if (model.hasNotif(notif)) {
    try {
        model.deleteNotif(notif);
    } catch (NullPointerException exp) {
        logger.info(MESSSAGE_NOTIF_DOES_NOT_EXIST);
    }
}

Platform.runLater(() -> {
    if (!model.hasNotif(notif)) {
        try {
            model.addNotif(notif);
        } catch (DuplicateNotifException exp) {
            logger.info(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_NOTIF);
        }
    }
});
```

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to delay change in status of the `Body`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `ScheduledExecutorService`.
** Pros: Does not depend on thread synchronization and avoids the need to deal with threads directly.
** Cons: May cause memory leaks if cache is not cleared.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `Thread.sleep`
** Pros: Straightforward way to delay a thread.
** Cons: May quickly run into OutOfMemory error.

Alternative 1 is the current choice because of its simplicity and robustness as it abstracts away the need
to manually deal with threads.

===== Aspect: How the behaviour of `NotifCommand` differs when the app is initialized
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do not show a pop-up if the difference between system time and
`notifCreationTime` exceeds `period` .
** Pros: Prevents the situation of multiple pop-ups on app initialization.
** Cons: Does not prompt the user who may in turn forget to contact the police.

* **Alternative 2:** Show pop-up on app initialization for `Notif` (s) in storage for which the difference between
system
time and `notifCreationTime` exceeds `period`.
** Pros: Ensures that the user does not forget about contacting the police.
** Cons: May slow down the computer and lag the app if there are too many pop-up notifications at the same time.

Alternative 1 is the current choice because we want the app to be responsive and scalable in the long term. The
notification bell is placed beside the command box to prevent instances of user forgetting to contact the police.

// tag::genpdf[]
=== Generate PDF Feature
This feature allows manager to automatically generate different kinds of reports with three commands: `genReport`, `genReports` and `genReportSummary`.

==== Implementation

The generate PDF feature is facilitated by `ReportGenerator` class.
It extends Mortago with the ability to create a report, supported by https://github.com/itext/itext7[iText external library].
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ReportGenerator#generate(body, sign)` -- Creates report containing sign name of manager in a PDF file for the specific body.
* `ReportGenerator#generateAll(sign)` -- Creates reports containing sign name of manager in a PDF file for all bodies registered in Mortago.
* `ReportGenerator#generateSummary(sign)` -- Creates a tabular summary report containing sign name of manager  in a PDF file for all bodies registered in Mortago.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 17) shows how the generate operation works:

.Sequence diagram when `genReport 1 John Doe` is executed by manager.
image::GenReportSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `GenReportCommandParser` and `ReportGenerator` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `genReport <BODY_ID> (sign)` command calls `ReportGenerator#generate(body, sign)`, which creates the document.

The following activity diagram (Figure 18) summarizes what happens when manager executes a `genReport <BODY_ID> (sign)` command:

.Activity diagram when `genReport 1 John Doe` is executed by manager.
image::GenReportActivityDiagram.png[]

The following code snippet from `GenReportCommand.java` demonstrates how an error message is displayed when manager inputs an invalid command and when report is not successfully generated:

        if (bodyToGenReport == null) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_ENTITY_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }
        boolean generated = reportGenerator.generate(bodyToGenReport, sign);
        if (!generated) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_REPORT_NOT_GENERATED);
        }

The following class diagram (Figure 19) models the relationships and dependencies among classes in this feature:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How generate report executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a PDF file.
** Pros: Implementation is easy.
** Cons: Implementation must ensure that each individual body attribute is correct.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a Word Document file.
** Pros: Implementation allows manager to edit the contents of the report.
** Cons: Implementation defeats the purpose of being automated.

Alternative 1 is the current choice because this will prevent manager from making accidental changes to the report when report is formatted in PDF.

===== Aspect: What library to utilise for generating PDF in Java

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use iText to implement this feature.
** Pros: Implementation is simple because using iText would allow an API-driven approach.
** Cons: Implementation is unable to use the latest version (iText 7) because it is not compatible, only version 5.5.13 is compatible.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Apache PDFBox to implement this feature.
** Pros: Implementation is easy because PDFBox is widely used and help is more accessible.
** Cons: Implementation is limited because PDFBox can only create simple PDFs based on text files, supports few of the features iText does.

Alternative 1 is the current choice because this implementation does not require the enhancements provided by iText 7 but still requires more advanced library to create tables in a PDF document.

===== Aspect: How report is formatted

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use tables to organise related details in the report.
** Pros: Implementation allows report to be organised, increases readability for manager.
** Cons: Implementation is tedious.
* **Alternative 2:** List all attributes in the report without any formatting.
** Pros: Implementation is easy.
** Cons: Implementation decreases readability for manager.

Alternative 1 is the current choice because manager will be able to save time and reduce work-related stress when manager is able to view an organised report.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::ui[]
=== User Interface and Dashboard Enhancement

The dashboard of Mortago plays a key part in presenting a sleek, organised, and concise overview to the entities in the system.
Thus, designing an aesthetic and functional dashboard is a crucial aspect for Mortago.

==== Surface Design and Coloring

Mortago draws upon the guidelines specified in https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#[Material.io] to design a dark theme
that enhances visual ergonomics and minimises eye strain due to the bright luminance emitted by screens.

*Visual Contrast Between Surfaces and Text*

With reference to  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG), the guidelines recommend that the contrast level
between dark surfaces and white text to be at least 15:8:1 to ensure visual accessibility.
Thus, the following color values are set within Mortago:


|===
|Aspect of Mortago |Color |Preview

|Background
|derive(#121212, 25%)
a| image::Background Color.png[]

|Surface
|#121212
a| image::Surface Color.png[]

|Primary
|#FF7597
a| image::Primary Color.png[]
|===


The background color uses the `derive` function in `JavaFX`, which computes a color that is brighter or darker than the original,
based on the brightness offset supplied. Here, notice that the background color is brighter than the surface color, as opposed to what Material.io dictates.
This is because bulk of the screen space in the Mortago is taken up by surfaces to optimize the amount of information available to the user,
hence by giving surfaces a darker brightness, this improves *overall* accessibility and visual ergonomics.
In addition, this achieves elevation between surfaces and the background, which is aided by drop shadows by surfaces as well.

The primary color is desaturated to reach a WCAG's AA standard of minimally 4:5:1.
This facilitates a mild yet impressionable visual aspect to Mortago while minimizing eye strain, as saturated colors can cause optical vibrations against the dark surface and exacerbate eye strain.

==== Replacing Window's Title Bar

In spirit with producing a sleek design, the standard Windows platform title bar was removed. This exposes the user interface to become one that is self-contained, while providing extra space at the top.

*Removing Window's Title Bar*

The following code snippet was placed in `MainApp#start()` to achieve this.

```
primaryStage.initStyle(StageStyle.TRANSPARENT);
```

Note that this has to be done before the stage is shown. Otherwise, the application will close automatically upon running.

However, with this removal, the default windows functions such as the default OS close button will be inevitably removed as well. Hence, these buttons will have to be rebuilt into the application.

*Rebuilding Window Functions*

The following image illustrates the minimise, maximise and exit buttons rebuilt into the menu bar.

(insert photo)

Each button was assigned its respective handler method, based on different events.

. Exit Button
* The method for exiting the application has already been implemented in `handleExit()`. Thus, setting the handler for the exit button to this method within the `MainWindow.fxml` file is sufficient.

. Minimise Button
* Minimisation of the application is implemented such that when the user clicks on the  minimise button, it triggers an `onMouseClicked` event that calls the following code.
```
primaryStage.setIconified(true)
```

[start = 3]
. Maximise Button
* Maximisation is implemented similarly to minimization. When the maximise button is clicked *initially*, it triggers a mouse click event, which is handled by the following code snippet.

```
maximiseButton.setOnMouseClicked(click -> {
            primaryStage.setMaximized(true);
            maximiseButton.setId("restoreButton");
        });
```

* However, when the button is clicked for the second time, the window is restored to its pre-maximised size. In order to implement this, a handler for the `onMousePressed` event has to be set, as seen in the following code snippet.

```
maximiseButton.setOnMousePressed(click -> {
            primaryStage.setMaximized(false);
            maximiseButton.setId("maximisevButton");
        });
```

Finally, the last functionality to rebuilt is the resizability of the Window. This implementation is adapted from a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19455059/allow-user-to-resize-an-undecorated-stage[post] in StackOverFlow. Briefly,  `ResizableWindow::enableResizableWindow()` allows the Windows to be resizable by implementing a helper class `ResizeListener`. The helper class listens to mouse events and tracks the mouse's movements to pinpoint the coordinates of the mouse. This determines the change in size of the Window, which will then be resized accordingly.


// end::ui[]
// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics feature
==== Current Implementation

The statistics feature appears as a line chart of the number of bodies admitted over the past 10 days (default view) and is facilitated by `LineChartPanel`. It extends `UiPart` with an internal storage of the number of bodies admitted per day over the past 10 days. The line chart is part of the user interface and is initialised automatically when Mortago is launched. Users can switch the view to a specified week, month, or view.

In `LineChartPanel`, four key operations that constructs the line chart and updates it dynamically are implemented, and they are executed in order as described below:

* `LineChartPanel#initialiseTreeMap()` -- Initialises a tree map that contains the dates as the keys and the number of bodies admitted as the frequency.
* `LineChartPanel#initialiseLineChart()` -- Creates a Line Chart with Xaxis and Yaxis.
* `LineChartPanel#updateSeries()` -- Adds data to the series of the line chart based on what is in the tree map.
* `LineChartPanel#updateUponChanged()` -- If a body is added or removed, the tree map is changed accordingly depending on the date of admission of the body, and the series is updated again.

The above operations are invoked through a wrapper function `LineChartPanel#makeLineChart()` which is invoked when the user calls `LineChartPanel#getLineChart()`.

The line chart is updated automatically because it takes in an ObservableList<Body> from the `AddressBook`, so it re-intialises once a change has been detected. The following sequence diagram shows hows adding a body changes the `AddressBook`, and then how`LineChartPanel` interacts `AddressBook` to obtain an observable list of bodies, creates a line chart from it, and then passes the line chart to be displayed in `MainWindow` with dynamic update:

)Sequence diagram showing the dynamic update of the line chart when user adds a new body.
image::LineChartAddBodySequenceDiagram.png[]

The user is able to switch the time frame of the line chart between the last ten days or a particular week, month, or year with the `stats` command (See User Guide). The following sequence diagram shows how the stats command affect the appearance of the line chart:

)Sequence diagram showing the changing view of the line chart when user specifies a different time frame.
image::LineChartTimeFrameSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How data is stored and updated

The line chart needs data to refer to. Below are two alternatives for how to access the data and update the line chart:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Data is not stored. Use a tree map to keep track of bodies and initialise the treemap depending on the given time frame.

The following activity diagram illustrates the current choice for accessing and updating data:

)Activity diagram for how the line chart populate values over the last ten days.
image::LineChartActivityDiagram.png[]

** Pros: Implementation is easy.
** Cons: Series is regenerated whenever there is a change in time frame. As can be seen from the activity diagram below, the series gets reintialised regardless of whether it will affect a change in the appearance of the line chart.


* **Alternative 2:** Store all data in a separate storage class.
** Pros: No need to reinitialise the treemap everytime a `stats` command is called.
** Cons: Implementation requires a lot of storage which may not be tapped on most of the time.

===== Aspect: The time frame of the line chart

Currently the line chart supports four types of time frames as aforementioned. Below are two alternatives to which users are limited by the time frames:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users can toggle between four types of time frames.
** Pros: Implementation is easy and simple.
** Cons: The statistics is limited in meaning if it cannot be compared between other time frames.

* **Alternative 2:** Users can print a summary of statistics over a specified period.
** Pros: The statistics will have more meaning.
** Cons: Implementation is difficult.
