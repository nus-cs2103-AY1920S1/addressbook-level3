The module emphasises theoretical issues as well as practical analysis. It explores the ways to establish proper networks, and examines approaches for effective internal and external communication in the context of today's changing social patterns, the increasing diversity of the workforce, the proliferation of new communications technologies, and the challenges of global integration and competition. Students will discuss the basic relationships among communication, information and organisation; and will examine the pervasive adoptive organisational functions of communication in modern organisations.",
