== Overview

CS ModBuddy is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for planning their modules. More importantly, CS ModBuddy is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

Overall contributions were in the field of User Interface and User Experience.

* *Major enhancement*: added *Autocomplete*
** What it does: When the user presses `tab`, the command word, or module code, or semester, or tag name will be autocompleted.
If there is only one possible completion, it will be filled immediately.
If there is more than one possible completion, a menu of possible autocompletions is drawn that can be selected with the up and down buttons.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it makes the entire basis of the command-line interface, typing commands, significantly smoother and easier.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects every part of the user experience in this CLI app.
It is interlinked with existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required some use of data structures, as well as integration with existing commands, module codes, and tags.
* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added expanding and collapsing of semesters, allows familiar semesters to take up less important visual space in the GUI.
** Added various GUI themes, such as light or dark mode, so that the user can customise the look of the GUI to their wants.
** Added a complex help function that can give general help and also specific help per command, which makes using the app much simpler.
** Added block command handling for adding modules, so multiple modules can be added to a semester at once.
** Handled most of the overall GUI design.
