    "description": "The concept of development has been crucial to structuring international legal relations for the last 70 years. In the political and economic domains, most international institutions engage with the development project in some form. This subject offers a conceptual and intellectual grounding to examine development as an idea and set of practices in dynamic relation with national and international law. The history of development in relation to imperialism, decolonisation, the Cold War and globalisation means that these relations are complex. Understanding them is crucial to understanding the place of international law, and the work development does in the world today.",
