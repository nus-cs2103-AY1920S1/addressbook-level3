    "description": "Disasters like floods, storms, new disease outbreaks are increasing in the world. Climate change adds new hazards and uncertainties to existing risks. But are disasters a result of increasing hazards or are we becoming more vulnerable to them? Will they remain as hazards if we plan for resilience? Is resilience built or managed? Students will critically analyse these questions through a systems approach developing qualitative and quantitative models to understand relations between hazards, vulnerability, policy interventions and development practices. The module will encourage students to analyse case studies and grasp the dynamic complexity between risks, social vulnerability and resilience.",
