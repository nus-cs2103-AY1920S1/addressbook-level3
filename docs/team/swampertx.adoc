== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *AutoSuggestion for any command input*

** What it does: Intelligently suggest possible commands while a user is typing. It detects user input at every single
    keystroke and suggests from the pool of commands, at a glance, unobtrusively and succinctly to the user. If a valid
    command is detected, a help messaged is displayed to prompt user input of specific, suitable arguments.

** Justification: The only feature needed for users to jump right into GuiltTrip and start using right away.
    It provides rich and relevant feedback to the user. It makes the user guide serve its purpose - as a source of
    reference should the user needs more information - otherwise the AutoSuggest feature is self-sufficient.

** Highlights: This suggester is modular and other metrics can be easily used to improve the matching algorithm.
    Currently a EditDistance metric is used to fetch the next few closest commands, and any other better metrics can be
    implemented and plugged in right away.

** Credits: _This feature is coded entirely from scratch. Inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance_
    , https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[Unix Fuzzy File Finder] among others.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the ability to automate Expense generation via the AutoExpense feature*

** What it does: allows the user set recurring Expense that are generated every time the application, GuiltTrip starts
    up. This provides great convenience that every targeted user would find useful as many Expenses recurred with a
    fixed frequency, eg. Bills, Meals, School Fees, Membership fees and others.

** Justification: This feature is essential for the application to be useful. Without it, manual generation of expenses
    everyday is a laborious job and having to type repeated details day after day is not just laborious, but also
    annoying. This feature provides convenience that is very practical to daily use, and is one that once a user tried
    it could never turn back to an application without.
** Highlights: This AutoExpense feature is customizable with user-set frequencies. User ergonomics is put in the first
    place - abbreviations like `every day`, `daily`, `day`, `every night` are all allowed for making an AutoExpense
    entry that recurs everyday.

** Credits: _This feature is coded entirely from scratch._

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub
*** Managed issues and lead team in using the issues tracker and automated PR issues resolution.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Refactored code with consistent patterns that can implement a feature across different
    command with a single method. (Eg. erroring in addcommands)

** Documentation:
*** Added CI/CD badges to website

** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-4/main/pull/292[#292]
** Tools:
*** Integrated CI/CD tools to Github
*** Enforced pushing rules on github - no push/force push to master
*** Enforced "build pass before merging" rule
