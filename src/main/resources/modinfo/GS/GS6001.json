    "description": "The module covers issues that any graduate student in science and engineering shall face at some point during their PhD candidature and in their subsequent academic careers. Through lectures, discussions and presentations, students shall ponder on and analyze ethical issues and dilemmas associated with data archival, mentoring, authorship, credit sharing and conflicts of interest. They shall rationalize internationally sanctioned rules and regulations in dealing with ethically sensitive research subjects. They shall be taught sensible and appropriate approaches in dealing with incidents of scientific misconduct, and how ethical integrity should and could be maintained in spite of research intensity and competition.",
