Examples of case reports, case series, cohort studies, case-control studies, intervention studies, and metaanalysis will be drawn from recent literature to illustrate the application of relevant methods and the challenges in postmarket assessment of therapeutic products. Major topics include: basic principles in pharmacoepidemiology, study designs for pharmacoepidemiologic studies, data sources, and therapeutic risk management. Methodological considerations relevant to pharmacoepidemiology, such as confounding by indication, will also be introduced.",
