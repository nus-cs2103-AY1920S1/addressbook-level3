== Introduction

MooLah is a expense tracker, morphed from the seedu project "AddressBook - Level 3".

Expense tracking is an inherently troublesome task, because it includes managing
multiple budgets, monitoring complicated statistics, and anticipating future spending.
MooLah aims to streamline this process by providing a user-friendly desktop Command-Line Interface (CLI) solution.

MooLah improves user experience through autocomplete and prefix suggestions, significantly boosting efficiency.
MooLah also adopts an external library Natty, a natural language time parser, so that it accepts
more intuitive input format for time. MooLah's robust budgeting feature allows users to track expenses under different
budgets, monitor their spending through the progress bar, and receive timely notification when important thresholds are
reached. With MooLah's powerful statistics, users can view a summary of their spending in various modes, be
it a pie chart, a table or a trend line. Besides, users can plan ahead and set up reminders for future events.
Furthermore, the menu feature is specially tailored to students in National University of Singapore, allowing them to
record a food item expense directly from preset menus in school canteens. Almost all commands in MooLah support
undo-redo, increasing tolerance for occasional mistakes and thus creating a seamless user experience.
All these solid and well-developed features make MooLah a perfect personal financial assistant.

=== Purpose & Scope
This document specifies architecture and software design decisions for the app MooLah.
The intended audience of this document is the developers, designers, and software testers of MooLah.

=== Software Overview
MooLah is a desktop CLI application that help users track their expenses.
The App supports many other extensions such as budgeting, planning and reminders.
In particular, it is tailored to students in National University of Singapore who dine frequently in school canteens.

=== Before We Begin

Here are some widely-used symbols in this document:

[NOTE]
Contains essential information that explains a concept more clearly.

[TIP]
Contains extra information that might be useful.

== Setting Up
This section contains information on steps to set up the developer environment on your computer.

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section explains MooLah's software architecture.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteexpense 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteexpense 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SinglePanelView`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Determines what commands are available to the user.
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

.Class diagram of the SinglePanelView component which implements the Panel Manager interface.
image::SinglePanelViewClassDiagram.png[width=400,align=center]

The content that is being shown in the `MainWindow` to the user is managed by a ``SinglePanelView`` which implements the
``PanelManager`` interface  that supports the following operations: +
``PanelManager#viewPanel(PanelName)`` +
``PanelManager#hasPanel(PanelName)`` +
``PanelManager#getPanel(PanelName)`` +
``PanelManager#setPanel(PanelName, Panel)`` +
``PanelManager#getCurrentPanel()`` +
``PanelManager#getCurrentPanelName()`` +
``PanelManager#removePanel(PanelName)`` +



.Structure of the SinglePanelView component used to display the Model components.
image::PanelManagerStructureDiagram.png[]

The ``PanelManager`` manages the other ``Panels`` which represent their respective ``Model`` component:

* ``AliasMappings`` as ``AliasListPanel``
* ``UniqueBudgetList`` as ``BudgetListPanel``
* Primary ``Budget`` as ``BudgetPanel``
* ``UniqueExpenseList`` as ``ExpenseListPanel``
* ``UniqueEventList`` as ``EventListPanel``
* ``Statistics`` as ``StatsPanel``

Each of these `Panels` extend the abstract `Panel` class and implement the abstract methods:

* ``Panel#view()`` which displays the panel to the user
* ``Panel#hide()`` which hides the panel from the user

When users execute a valid command, via ``Logic``, the ``Model`` is updated. These changes are reflected in the respective ``Panel`` components.
The ``CommandResult`` returned by the ``Logic`` component also tells the ``UI`` which ``Panel`` needs to be displayed.

The ``UI`` then displays the ``Panel`` to the user.

Users may also manually change between the visible ``Panels`` through the CLI by using the `view` command.

The following sequence diagram shows the events which occur in order to change the the UI `Panel` component displayed in the ``SinglePanelView``
component of the ``MainWindow`` when the user executes a ``view`` command.

.Sequence Diagram showing the events that occur when a user uses the view command.
image::ViewPanelSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. The user executes a valid view command
2. The ``Logic`` parses the input as a ``ViewPanelCommand``
3. The ``#run(Model)`` method of the ``ViewPanelCommand`` instance returns a ``CommandResult`` containing a ``PanelName``
4. The ``MainWindow`` uses the `PanelName` to call ``PanelManager#viewPanel(PanelName)``.
5. The ``SinglePanelView`` object which implements ``PanelManager`` calls the ``#view()`` on the panel which needs to be displayed,
and calls ``#hide()`` on all other panels.
6. The user sees the changes to the GUI.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MooLahParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an expense).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the MooLah data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Budget>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moolah/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the MooLah data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.moolah.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo and Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo and redo functionality is facilitated by `ModelHistory`, which is available as an instance-level member of `Model`. It keeps track of the model's history
by storing the changed fields of the model throughout execution, which will be represented as `ModelChanges`. Internally, `ModelHistory` stores the history by using two stacks of `ModelChanges`, namely, `pastChanges` and `futureChanges`.

With the addition of model history, `Model` can support these operations:

* `Model#applyChanges(ModelChanges)` -- Applies the given changes to the model.
* `Model#commit(String, Model)` -- Saves the changes between the current model and the given previous model to the past changes history, keeping the previous model's data should there be any differences. This adds the changes to the past history, and clears the future history.
* `Model#rollback()` -- Restores the model one step back by applying the changes described in the immediate previous changes in history.
* `Model#migrate()` -- Moves the model one step forward in history by applying the changes described in the immediate next changes.

To support these capabilities, `ModelChanges` offers these methods as well:

* `ModelChanges#compareModels(Model, Model)` -- Compares two models' data and creates a new `ModelChanges` object that describes the field data of the first model that is different with the second model.
* `ModelChanges#revertChanges(Model)` -- Reverts the current changes with respect to the base model given.

Refer to the class diagram below for comprehensive list of the methods offered and the association of both classes:

image::ModelHistory.png[width=70%,pdfwidth=80%,align=center]

[NOTE]
Typical field accessor and mutator methods are omitted for brevity, except when it returns a different type from the field's type (e.g. `ModelChanges#getMooLah()`).

`ModelHistory` only stores changes of models that were (or are going to be) executed by model-manipulating - or simply, undoable - commands.
As some of the commands available are intuitively not undoable (e.g. `help`), every command is configured to extend either `UndoableCommand` or a non-undoable `Command` classes.
With the division, `Model#commit(String, Model)` will only be called if the command to be executed is an instance of `UndoableCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo and redo functionality behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The current `ModelHistory` is now empty.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[width=35%,pdfwidth=35%,align=center]

Step 2. The user executes `addexpense d/chicken rice p/2.50 c/food` command to add an expense.
The `addexpense` command, being an `UndoableCommand`, calls `Model#commit(String, Model)`, which saves the state of the model just before the command executes to `pastChanges`, and `futureChanges` is cleared.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[width=40%,pdfwidth=50%,align=center]

Step 3. The user executes `deleteexpense-primary 1` to delete the first expense on the list. The `deleteexpense-primary` command, also an `UndoableCommand`, calls `Model#commit(String, Model)`, inserting another entry to the `pastChanges` and clearing `futureChanges` again.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[width=35%,pdfwidth=40%,align=center]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit(String, Model)`, so the model will not be saved into `ModelHistory`.

Step 4. The user now decides that deleting the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#rollback()`, which will retrieve the immediate previous change in history, adding the reverting change to the future history of the model, and applies the change to the model.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[width=35%,pdfwidth=40%,align=center]

[NOTE]
If `pastChanges` is empty, then there are no previous changes to roll back. The `undo` command uses `Model#canRollback()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

Step 5. The user then realizes the expense should be deleted after all, and wishes to redo the deletion by entering the `redo` command. The command will call `Model#migrate()`, which will get the immediate next change in history, adding the reverting change to the past history, and applies the change to the model.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[width=40%,pdfwidth=50%,align=center]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo command works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[width=70%,pdfwidth=50%,align=center]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Inversely, the `redo` command calls `Model#migrate()`, which retrieves the immediate next changes in history, adds the reverting change to the past history, and applies the changes to the model.

[NOTE]
If `futureChanges` is empty, then there are no snapshots to be redone. The `redo` command uses `Model#canMigrate()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

As explained earlier, additions of entry to `ModelHistory` will only be performed when the command being executed is an instance of `UndoableCommand`.
The following diagram briefly describes how the execution of undoable commands will do so:

image::UndoableCommandActivityDiagram.png[width=40%,pdfwidth=40%,align=center]

==== Design Considerations
In implementing the undo and redo functionality, some design approaches and trade-offs have to be considered to account
for feature efficiency in computation time and memory usage.

===== Aspect: How undo and redo executes

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the model data.
** Pros: It is easier to implement.
** Cons: The approach introduces a component that will take up memory.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual commands have their own counter-command that negate the effects.
** Pros: This approach is quite intuitive (e.g. for `addmenuexpense`, we can do `deleteexpense-primary` to counter it).
** Cons: It has to be ensured that the implementation of each individual command is correct.
* **Current implementation (Alternative 1)**:
We choose this approach as it will be less likely to cause problems specific to restoring the state precisely to the state before the execution of a command,
as some commands will create a problem specific on their own which might not be supported by the proposed counter-command.
As an example, to undo `delete 3`, we must re-add that expense to that specific position (third from beginning), which at the moment is not supported
by the `addexpense` command.

===== Aspect: How to store the model data

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire model.
** Pros: It is easier to implement.
** Cons: The approach introduces a lot of memory usage and some data might not be necessary.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves the members of the model that were (or are going to be) changed.
** Pros: This approach is more conservative in memory usage, only saving fields that are changed means every data is necessary.
** Cons: Every field must be immutable to preserve changes, which requires a rework on accessing and manipulating fields.
* **Current implementation (Alternative 2)**:
We choose this approach as the time and memory resource trade-off is less significant compared to Alternative 1. As Alternative 2 stores
only the data needed to correctly reflect the change, it requires less memory and also executes in less time as Alternative 1.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Menu-item Expenses Feature
The menu-item expenses feature is another way to add an expense to MooLah given the expense to be added is a food or drink that is from
canteens in National University of Singapore (NUS) and said item is supported in MooLah.

==== Implementation
Each menu item is stored as a `MenuItem` object, which has a description and price. These items are then contained in `Menu`, within the list
of accepted menu items. Whenever the user enters the `addmenuexpense` command with a menu-item description, MooLah will
look up the list of expenses in `Menu` that matches the description, and if there is such menu item, it will add

See the class diagram below for available methods on `Menu` and `MenuItem`:

image::Menu.png[width=30%,align=center]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add menu-item expense feature is processed within MooLah:

image::AddMenuExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[width=100%,align=center]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The command the feature should be under
* Alternative 1: Modify the general add expense command to accept menu-item expense format and user-defined expense format.
** Pros: This approach is quite natural for end-users to use as menu-item expense is essentially a shorthand for user-defined expense.
** Cons: MooLah has to support command option groups to enable multiple sets of required prefixes on the same command word.
* Alternative 2: Create a new command for the adding menu-item expenses
** Pros: This approach is easier to implement.
** Cons: End-users now have two different commands to add expense, which is not too user-friendly.
* Current implementation (Alternative 2): As of now, MooLah has not yet supported mutually-exclusive command formats.
The time and resource to develop multiple formats, compared to adding a new command, will be much expensive, as it will take a major rework on how autocomplete processes user inputs to perform the former.
Thus, we decided to implement Alternative 2 instead.

// tag::budget[]
=== Budgeting Feature
The budgeting feature allows users to: (i) *add, delete and modify* budgets; (ii) monitor spending by the budget's
*progress bar* and *pop up notifications*; (iii) easily *modify or remove expenses* from the budget; (iv) *switch
period* to view past expenses; and (v) *switch the primary budget* to flexibly track expenses under different budgets.

==== Basics

Budgets form a *partition* of all expenses. That is, an `Expense` must belong to one and only one `Budget`,
and all expenses from all `Budget` must add up to the total number in the general expense list.
Each `Expense` keeps track of its own `Budget` through the `budgetName` attribute -- this is possible because
`UniqueBudgetList` disallows duplicate budget names. On the other hand, each `Budget` keeps track of a list of `Expense`
added to this budget, as shown in the figure below.

image::ExpenseAndBudgetRelationshipClassDiagram.png[width=33%]

//As shown in the figure below, each `Budget` has 5 attributes:
//
//. *description* (Description) : budget name;
//. *amount* (Price) : budget limit;
//. *window* (BudgetWindow) : the current budgeting period (see <<BudgetWindow and SwitchPeriodCommand>>)
//. *expenses* (ObservableList<Expense>) : the list of all expenses under this budget
//. *isPrimary* (boolean) : a flag indicating whether this budget is currently primary budget
//(see <<Primary Budget and SwitchBudgetCommand>>)
//
//image::BudgetClassDiagram.png[width=60%]

==== Add, Edit, Delete, Clear Budgets
There are five commands related to the addition, modification and removal of budgets, namely:
`AddBudgetCommand`, `EditBudgeCommand`, `DeleteBudgetByIndexCommand`, `DeleteBudgetByNameCommand`,
and `ClearBudgetsCommand`. +

Here is the class diagram of `AddBudgetCommand`:

image::AddBudgetCommandClassDiagram.png[width=60%]

As shown in the figure above, `AddBudgetCommand` has 2 methods:
(i) `validate(model)`, which checks whether the command is legal (i.e. will not result in duplicate budgets being added
 to MooLah), and throws `CommandException` to notify user of the illegal input if any;
(ii) `execute(model)`, which runs this command in model and successfully adds a new budget.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add budget` operation works:

image::AddBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddBudgetCommandParser` and `AddBudgetCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to
a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

As shown in the figure above, when user inputs "addbudget ...", `LogicManager` executes the `String`, and `MooLahParser`
creates the corresponding `CommandParser` which parses the input into an `AddBudgetCommand`. `AddBudgetCommand` then
validates itself by checking if there is an identical `Budget` already existing in `MooLah`. If no duplicate budgets are
found, it executes the command, adding the new `Budget` to `MooLah`. After that, `AddBudgetCommand` creates a `CommandResult`
and passes it back to `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` then saves the updated `MooLah` as Json file, and returns the
`CommandResult` to GUI to be displayed to user.

The implementation of other commands follows a similar flow as `AddBudgetCommand`, differing only in the parameters and corresponding
methods in ModelManager. A noteworthy implementation in `EditBudgetCommand` is that it has a inner class `EditBudgetDescriptor`
to record the updated attributes of the budget, which is then used in the method `EditBudgetCommand#createEditedBudget(Budget, EditBudgetDescriptor)`
to create an edited `Budget`, maintaining non-updated attributes the same as the original `Budget`.

When a `Budget` is edited, the original budget's expenses will be transferred to the updated budget through
`Budget#transferExpensesTo(Budget other)`. The transfer process does two things: (i) set the expenses's `budgetName`
to the new budget's name; (ii) add the expenses to the new budget's expense list. Similarly, when a `Budget` is deleted,
all its expenses will be transferred to `Default Budget` through the same method.

==== Primary Budget and SwitchBudgetCommand
At any time, there is one, and only one, *primary budget* in MooLah. All expenses added will go to this primary budget.
If the user wants to track expenses under a different budget, he switches to the target budget first, before adding the expense.
A newly created budget is automatically set to primary.
MooLah creates a `Default Budget` upon first launching. If no budget is created by the user, expenses will be tracked
under this `Default Budget`, which has a huge budget limit (`10^21`) and budgeting period (`100 years`).

The `SwitchBudgetCommand` takes in a budget name and switches primary budget to that budget.
Given below is an example usage scenario of SwitchBudgetCommand: +

*Step 1.* The user launches MooLah for the first time. The default budget will be created and set as the primary budget.

image::PrimaryBudget1.png[width=40%]

*Step 2.* The user adds an expense "bubble tea". Since the default budget is the primary one, this expense will go
under default budget.

image::PrimaryBudget2.png[width=40%]

*Step 3.* The user creates a budget "School". Since "School" is newly added, it will be set as the primary budget.

image::PrimaryBudget3.png[width=40%]

*Step 4.* The user adds an expense "chicken rice". Since "School" is the primary budget, this expense will go
under "School".

image::PrimaryBudget4.png[width=40%]

*Step 5.* The user now wants to add another expense "movie", but does not want it tracked under "School". As such, the
user executes `switchbudget d/default budget`. The default budget is now the primary budget.

image::PrimaryBudget5.png[width=40%]

*Step 6.* The user adds the expense "movie", which is tracked under the current primary budget - default budget.

image::PrimaryBudget6.png[width=40%]

==== BudgetWindow and SwitchPeriodCommand

A budget is like a *sliding window* that moves along the time axis. The window has a fixed size determined by
`BudgetPeriod`, an enum class with five values: `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `INFINITY` (for Default Budget).
Only expenses within the *current window* are shown in the app. Every time the budget refreshes, the window "slides"
to the next period, starting with an empty screen that gradually gets populated with newly added expenses over time.
This is achieved through the `BudgetWindow` class.

Here is the class diagram of `BudgetWindow`:

image::BudgetWindowClassDiagram.png[width=33%]

As shown in the figure above, `BudgetWindow` has 3 attributes: start date, end date, and period. The start and end
dates are modifiable, but the period is fixed. This corresponds to the above-mentioned "sliding window" concept.

A budget keeps a list of all expenses ever been tracked by this budget, including historical ones. Additionally,
it has a method `Budget#getCurrentPeriodExpenses()` that filters from this list expenses within the current
budgeting period, which in turn get to be shown on MooLah's GUI.

When users want to view expenses in a past period, they can do so by executing `SwitchPeriodCommand`. This command
takes in a `Timestamp` and switches the budget window to a period anchored by that `Timestamp`. This is achieved by
`BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `SwitchPeriodCommand`: +

*Step 1.* The user has a monthly budget "school" that recurs on `the 5th of each month`. Suppose the current date is
`10 Nov`. As a result, the current budgeting period will be `5 Nov - 4 Dec`.

*Step 2.* The user wants to view expenses in September. As such, the user executes `switchperiod t/20-09`
(`20-09` is interchangeable with any other dates within `5 Sep - 4 Oct`). This command calls
`BudgetWindow#normalize`, which shifts the window's start and end dates to `5 Sep` and `4 Oct` respectively,
while maintaining the fixed period -- `MONTH`. As a result, the user sees expenses tracked under the budget during `5 Sep - 4 Oct`.

The `BudgetWindow#normalize` method is also called upon adding a new `Budget` to MooLah. No matter how
far the start date inputted by the user is from now, it will be normalized to the current period, such that expenses added
subsequently will correctly be reflected in the budget panel.

Each budget, once added, will recur infinitely. This is achieved by `Budget#refresh()`, along with the `Timekeeper` class.
Every 0.05 second, `Timekeeper` checks if the system time is at day break, and call `Budget#refresh()` if necessary. Subsequently,
`BudgetWindow#normalize` is called; the anchor passed in is current time. As a result, the `Budget` is
successfully normalized to the current period.

//==== Add, Edit, Delete Expense from a Budget
//Addition of expenses are executed through AddExpenseCommand. Since it does not take in any INDEX parameters,
//the execution can be done irrespective of the currently shown list, and the change will always be correctly reflected
//in the budget panel.
//The case is different for editing and deleting expenses, which takes in an INDEX dependent on the currently shown list.
//As such, editing from the general expense list is different from editing from a budget's expense list. This is why two
//separate commands, EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand and DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand, are implemented, apart from
//EditExpenseCommand and DeleteExpenseCommand which work on the general expense list.
//
//EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand and DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand obtain their target expense (to be edited/deleted)
//through `model.getPrimaryBudget().getCurrentPeriodExpenses()` in the two commands' validate() and execute() method.
//This makes sure the INDEX is based on the primary budget's currently shown expense list, which includes all expenses
//within the current budgeting period.

//==== List budgets
//ListBudgetsCommand shows a list of all budgets stored in MooLah. The command returns a CommandResult with view
//request to "BudgetListPanel.PANEL_NAME". Subsequently, MainWindow#changePanel(PanelName) will switch the currently
//shown panel to BudgetListPanel.
//ListBudgetsCommand has the same effect as "view budget list".

==== UI Component of Budget
There are three classes related to the UI display of budgets:
(i) `BudgetCard`, which shows the budget name, period, and progress bar -- GUI representation of a `Budget`
(ii) `BudgetListPanel`, which displays a list of `BudgetCard` -- called through `ListBudgetsCommand` or `view budget list`
(iii) `BudgetPanel`, which displays a `BudgetCard` at the top, and a list of current period expenses below -- called through `view primary budget`

The progress bar in `BudgetCard` shows the proportion used against the budget limit. This is calculated by
`Budget#calculateProportionUsed()`, which divides the *sum of all current period expenses* against the *budget limit*,
returning a `Percentage` that wraps the result (rounded to the nearest integer).

Besides, the budget also gives popup notification when proportion used reaches *50%*, *90%*, and *100%*. These 3 status
correspond to `Budget#isHalf()`, `Budget#isNear()` and `Budget#isExceeded()`. Before each command in MooLah is executed, the
initial values of these 3 booleans are recorded by `LogicManager#recordInitialPrimaryBudgetStatus()`, which returns a
boolean array of size 3. At the end of each command, the final values of these 3 booleans are recorded again by
`LogicManager#recordFinalPrimaryBudgetStatus()`. The two arrays are then passed into `MainWindow#showWarningIfAny()`
for a comparision, and if any values have changed, `MainWindow#showPopupMessage()` will show the corresponding pop up
notification to remind the user of the budget progress.

==== Storage of Budgets
Budget objects are stored in Json format, through the `JsonAdaptedBudget` class. The Json file has the same properties
as the budget, except: (i) it flattens the `BudgetWindow` field into start date, end date and period, for clearer display;
(ii) it stores a list of `UniqueIdentifier` to expenses, instead of a list of `JsonAdaptedExpense`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens to budgets when the app launches and when a new expense is added:

image::BudgetActivityDiagram.png[width=55%]

==== Integration with Undo-Redo
Budgeting-related commands integrate well with Undo-Redo feature, by extending `UndoableCommand`. Undoable commands are
those modifying data in MooLah, for example, `AddBudgetCommand` and `EditBudgetCommand`. On the other hand, commands that
only result in GUI changes, such as `ListBudgetsCommand`, is not undoable.

A difficulty here is to make every "undo" immediately reflected on GUI. Since undo rollback on models, this dictates that
every change must result in a new budget object being created and replacing the old one. Otherwise, even though the
change is reflected backend, it will not show in frontend because the Budgets in two models are still referring to
the same object. This task is handled by `Budget#deepCopy()`, which is widely called from `UniqueBudgetList`, in every method
that modifies the existing budgets.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Since Budget already keeps a list of Expense, should Expense have a Budget field?

* **Alternative 1:** `Expense` has a `Budget` field
** Pros: Easier to manage expenses.
** Cons: Causes cyclical dependency, and reduces testability. Also, this will cause infinite loop when creating
`JsonAdaptedExpense` and `JsonAdaptedBudget`.

* **Alternative 2:** `Expense` does not have any reference to `Budget`
** Pros: Less coupling.
** Cons: When reconstructing MooLah from Json file, system does not know which budget to add the past expenses to.

* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Each `Expense` keeps a `budgetName` field which indicates the name of the `Budget` it is tracked under. Since `UniqueBudgetList`
disallows duplicate budget names, a name is sufficient to identify a `Budget`. Besides, since `budgetName` is of
`Description` type instead of `Budget` type, it is easy to convert to `String`, and resolves the problem of infinite loop
when creating Json files. Also, the resulting `JsonAdaptedExpense` file will not be too long, since the `budgetName` property
stores only the budget name instead of the full `Budget` object.

===== Aspect: Can one Expense be tracked under multiple Budget? Or under no Budget at all?

* **Alternative 1:** Every `Expense` must be tracked under one, and only one `Budget`.
** Pros: Budgets would be a partition of all expenses, which makes generating statistics (pie charts, etc.) easier.
** Cons: Reduces flexibility in tracking expenses - users would not be able to track expenses that fall under multiple
budgets.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow `Expense` with multiple `Budget`, or without any `Budget`.
** Pros: Users would enjoy more flexible budgeting experience.
** Cons: This might result in duplicate calculation of expenses and difficulty in generating pie charts, as statistics
revolves around budgets.

* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Adopt Alternative 1. Every Expense must be tracked under one and only one budget. If the expense is added before
adding any budgets, a default budget with a huge limit and infinite period is created for tracking all expenses without
a proper user-defined budget. This ensures that the main screen has a budget and shows a budget status bar at all times.
Besides, it leads to neater statistics.

===== Aspect: How should JsonAdaptedBudget keep track of the budget's expenses?

* **Alternative 1:** `JsonAdaptedBudget` stores a list of `JsonAdaptedExpense`
** Pros: More intuitive, improving readability of Json file. Also eases reconstruction of MooLah from storage file,
since `JsonAdaptedExpense` can be easily converted to model type `Expense`.
** Cons: Json file is subject to user modification. If expenses are modified such that those in general expense list
differ from their counterparts in budget's expense list, this will cause data inconsistency and introduce bugs into
MooLah.

* **Alternative 2:** `JsonAdaptedBudget` stores a list of `UniqueIdentifier`
** Pros: Guards against accidental user modification of Json file.
** Cons: More hassle when reconstructing MooLah from storage, since `JsonAdaptedBudget#toModelType` will need to
refer to MooLah's expense list, identify those expenses by their `UniqueIdentifier`, and add them to the budget.

* **Solution (Current implementation):**
Adopt Alternative 2. Since every expense has a unique identifier, a list of `UniqueIdentifier`, supplemented with a list
of MooLah's general expenses, is sufficient to correctly reconstruct those expenses tracked under this budget. The
benefit of protecting MooLah from external Json modification outweighs the extra hassle in reconstructing MooLah from
storage.
// end::budget[]

// tag::events[]

=== Events feature
==== Implementation

The Events feature allows users to add events that are supposed to occur on a future date.

On launch, MooLah will remind users of upcoming events. While the app is open, MooLah will also notify the user about any events that have transpired,
and allow them to automatically add these events as expenses.

image::EventClassDiagram.png[align=center]

Like expenses, events hold two Descriptions (one for its details and one for the budget it belongs to), a Price, a Timestamp
and a Category. The `setBudget` method of Event is used for the Event to remember which budget it was added to. This facilitates
the potential conversion of the Event into an Expense through the `convertToExpense` method. This method is called when the user
accepts the automated addition of an expense from the corresponding event, into the budget that the event was added into a while back.
Since Event's fields are a subset of that of Expense, all its fields are passed into the Expense constructor during the conversion, and a
unique identifier is then generated to complete the creation of the expense, allowing it to be added to MooLah.

The Events feature supports the `addevent`, `deleteevent`, `editevent` and `listevent` command words.

As mentioned earlier, MooLah displays reminders of upcoming events during launch. The implementation is shown below:

image::DisplayReminders.png[align=center]

To allow for precise timekeeping of expenses and events as well as accurate prompting of transpired events, MooLah tracks system time every 0.05 seconds using a `Timer` running
on a parallel thread. Using another `Timer`, MooLah then checks for transpired events every 2 seconds; an event is then deemed to have transpired if its timestamp has gone past system time.
The following sequence diagram shows how MooLah handles transpired events:

image::TranspiredEventsSequenceDiagram.png[align=center]

1. When MooLah launches, the `start` method of `UiManager` is called. Every 0.05 seconds, `UiManager` calls `updateTime` of
Timekeeper to update system time. Concurrently, `UiManager` also calls the `handleTranspiredEvents` of `MainWindow` every 2 seconds, which fetches all transpired
events and notifies the user about them. It does so by first obtaining the transpired events from the `Timekeeper` class.

2. Once the transpired events have been obtained, for each transpired event, a new `TranspiredEventWindow` will be
constructed. The transpired event is deleted from the model and will then be passed via `show`, a method of the newly constructed `TranspiredEventWindow`.
`show` will create a popup window that details the transpired event, and asks the user whether it should be added as an
expense. This popup window will have a 'Yes' and 'No' button.

3. If the user presses the 'Yes' button, the event is passed to the `addExpenseFromEvent` method of `LogicManager`, where
it is then converted into its corresponding expense, and a command to add the expense is run.

4. If the user presses the 'No' button, the expense is not added.

5. After pressing either button, the popup window closes.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What command words should the Events feature use?

* ** Alternative 1:** `addevent`, `deleteevent`, etc.
** Pros: Makes it clear to the user that events are separate from expenses
** Cons: Somewhat clunky and redundant, especially since expenses and events share the same fields

* ** Alternative 2:** `add`, `delete`, etc. (i.e. same command words as adding expenses)
** Pros: More streamlined, makes use of the fact that expenses and events share the same fields
** Cons: The distinction between events and expenses is more blurry to the user

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
Adopt Alternative 1. Although Alternative 2 is more intuitive, it is not suited to our current implementation of
generic command words. Since command words such as `add` and `delete` now result in different commands based on which
panel the user is on, MooLah's parser would not know whether users want to add an event or expense if they type `add` while on an event
or expense panel. This necessitates the splitting of expense and event commands into two separate command words.


===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)

Users can set their expenses to recur. Recurring expenses will generate events daily/weekly/monthly (based on
the user's decision) that can then be added as expenses when their due dates are reached.

// end::events[]

// tag::statsdg[]
=== Statistics Feature

==== Implementation
The statistics feature allows users to have an alternative view for the entries in `MooLah`.
It is facilitated by the `Statistics` interface, which is part of the `model` package, and is implemented by 3 classes
`PieChartStatistics`, `TabularStatistics` and `TrendStatistics`. Each of the implementing classes will be invoked when
their respective parsers detect its corresponding command word, which is `statsbasic`, `statscompare` and `statstrend`.
The prefix configurations vary greatly between them as well as the visual representation they create.

Given below is a class diagram to summarise the relationship between `Statistics` and its implementing classes.


image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]


The main entries that `Statistics` interacts with are `Expense` class and the `Budget` class. The entire statistics features only
supports the generating of statistics from only the current budget and responds to the different methods called by
the current `Budget` object. Every successful interaction will force a switch to the `Statistics Panel`, where each of
their different visual representations will be generated.

The following activity diagram summarizes how statistics are shown from a current budget after possible user inputs
to modify the attributes of the budget.


image::BasicStatisticsCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

In the following sections, the implementation details of one of the more complicated command words will be discussed,
as well as its design considerations.


==== `statsbasic`



The purpose of the `statsbasic` command word is to request `MooLah` to visualise the total expenditure across
expenses of different categories as a percentage of the total expenditure of all expenses tracked under the budget
where the command is called. The visual representation used here will be a PieChart.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `statsbasic` command word is handled by `MooLah`.



Step 1. The user enters the command `statsbasic sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019` to visualise the total percentage of each category
as a percentage of total expenditure across all categories, in the primary budget.
The command is received by `MooLahParser`, which then creates a `StatsCommandParser` object,
to subsequently help to parse the input by the user.

Step 2. The newly created `StatsCommandParser` calls `parse("stats sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019")`,
which in turns calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize("sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019", PREFIX_START_DATE, PREFIX_END_DATE)` to
split the arguments into its preamble(the start date and end date). This returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object, `argMultimap` containing the split input.


Step 3. The `StatsCommandParser` object creates a `StatsDescriptor` object `desc` to hold the start date and end date that was specified by the user.
Depending on the presence of start date and end date, `desc` will be filled in differently.

If the start date and end date is both specified by the user, the start date will be checked to be before the end date.
If the end date happens to be before the start date, a `ParseException` will be thrown

Step 4. The filled `desc` will be returned to the `LogicManager` where a new `StatsCommand` command, `statsCommand` will be created with `desc`



Step 5. The `LogicManager` calls `StatsCommand#run()`, where the `StatsCommand` will be validated before getting executed.

Step 6. During execution, `StatsCommand` calls `ModelManager#getPrimaryBudget()` to retrieve the primary budget to calculate statistics from.
After which, `StatsCommand` will call `createPieChartStatistics`, which takes in `desc` and the primary budget.

Step 7. To construct the time interval required for statistics, information from `desc` is being processed.
If there are unspecified inputs inside `desc`, the time interval will be constructed with some information from the primary budget.

Step 8. The `PieChartStatistics` object will be created with the constructed interval as well as the expenses the primary budget tracks.
After which, `StatsCommand` will call `PieChartStatistics` implementation of `populateData()` to fill up its other fields

Step 9. `StatsCommand` calls `ModelManager#setStatistics(statistics)` which updates the `Statistics` attribute in `ModelManager`.

Step 10. A `CommandResult` is then created and returned to `LogicManager`, which will then force a switch
to the `Statistics Panel` where a Pie Chart will be generated.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `statsbasic` operation works:

// tag::statsdesign[]

==== Design Considerations

When designing the interaction of the command word `statsbasic`, decisions have to be made on the most
suitable visual representation for `statsbasic` particular use case.

* ** Alternative 1:** Table view
** Pros: Sequential view, can capture number of entries
** Cons: May be a duplicate of the `ListExpense` command, just grouping expenses via categories

* ** Alternative 2:** Pie chart
** Pros: Offers a visual view of size to represent the expenditure under each category
** Cons: Loses the elements of number of entries in each category

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
Adopts Alternative 2. It is important that every aspect of the user experience gets covered, and what `MooLah` before the
inclusion of `Statistics` is the appreciation of percentage expenditure in each category of expenses. Expenses can already be
observed in its chronological order using `ListExpense` while individual view of expenses under a category can be accessed
using `FindExpense`. Offering a visual view on expenditure under each category complements with the existing implementation
of sequential view in the primary budget.
// end::statsdesign[]

===== Future Implementation (Coming in v2.0)

For each of the command words, users will be given the option to choose a Visual Representation method they prefer
if the use case allows for it, instead of the default option we have prioritised.
Currently, statistics under `statsbasic` mode can only be displayed in a pie chart,
and users may have different preferences for formats. The current implementation for MooLah
is such that only expenses up to the current date will be included and any expenses after the current date
is considered an event, which is not tracked by statistics. The inclusion of events in statistics
can be a possible complementary feature to a prediction feature to pre-empt users about their incoming expenses.
Last of all, more modes can be added to all existing commands, such as comparing with periods across different budgets
other than being restricted within the same budget

// tag::alias[]

=== Alias feature
The Alias feature allows users to assign inputs they may use very often to a shortcut, and execute the input by entering
the shortcut, (a.k.a ``Alias``), in place of the full or partial command.


==== Implementation

.AliasMappings Class Diagram
image::AliasMappingsClassDiagram.png[AliasMappingsClassDiagram]

These user defined ``Alias``es are saved in an ``AliasMappings`` object within ``UserPref`` as seen in the above diagram.
Internally, the ``AliasMappings`` object stores an ``Alias`` in a Map<Strings, Alias> object. With the addition of `AliasMappings` object to ``UserPref``,
``UserPref`` supports these additional operations:

- ``UserPref#addUserAlias(Alias)`` -- Saves a specified `Alias` to the user preferences for future use.
- ``UserPref#hasAlias(String)`` -- Query if the there is an `Alias` with this name already defined.
- ``UserPref#getAlias(String)`` -- To get an `Alias` with this name if it exists.
- ``UserPref#aliasNameIsReservedCommandWord(Alias)`` -- To query if this `Alias` is uses a name which clashes with existing built-in
commands.
- ``UserPref#aliasCommandWordIsAlias(Alias)`` -- To query if this `Alias` `input` begins with another `Alias`, this is used
to validate that an `Alias` will not cause an infinite loop by chaining multiple aliases in a loop.
- ``UserPref#getAliasMappings()`` -- To access the ``Alias`` saved by the user.
- ``UserPref#setAliasMappings(AliasMappings mappings)`` -- To overwrite all the `Alias` saved by the user.


===== Alias creation
.AddAliasCommand Class Diagram
image::AliasCommandClassDiagram.png[]

In order for the user to save an ``Alias``, they first define it using the ``AliasCommand``. The ``AliasCommand`` command extends
`UndoableCommand` to allow users to undo defining an `Alias`. The following sequence diagram describe in more detail how an ``Alias``
is added.

Alias and AliasMapping are in Model and not Core. This change has yet to be reflected in the following sequence diagrams.

===== Usage of aliases in input
.Activity Diagram showing the a high level view of the events that occur when parsing a command.
image::CommandParsingActivityDiagram.png[width=500,align=center]

When a user enters an ``input`` to be executed, the ``MooLahParser`` will do the following:

. Attemps to parse the ``input`` as an input which begins with a valid ``CommandWord``
. If that fails, it will try to parse it as an input which begins with an ``Alias``.
.. If it successfully does so, it replaces the alias in the original `input` with the ``input`` stored in the ``Alias``.
.. Finally, the ``MooLahParser`` re-parses the modified ``input``.
. If this too fails, an exception is thrown indicating that the command was invalid

// end::alias[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Potential Recursive aliases
As users may modify the data files of MooLah, they may modify the aliases directly. As such it was necessary to validate
that the modified aliases will not cause infinite recursion. This is done by traversing between aliases which chain to each other
and ensuring that none of them lead back to themselves. Otherwise, if it is detected that an alias can loop to itself, the
alias data is reset.

===== Aspect: Why can an `Alias` only be used at the beginning of an input versus anywhere within an input.
* ** Alternative 1(Chosen):** Beginning only
** Pros: Easier to determine which word is the shortcut.
** Pros: Easier to detect recursion due to alias chaining.
** Cons: Less flexible in term how the shortcut can be used i.e. it can only replace or prefix an input.

* ** Alternative 2:** Anywhere in input
** Pros: A wider variety of shortcuts can be defined by the user +
e.g. `add deckChicken 2.50`, where `deckChicken` maps to `d/ chicken rice c/ food p/`.
** Cons: Harder to detect recursion due to alias chaining.
** Cons: Parsing becomes more complicated and alias words become unusable in other contexts.
e.g. defining an `Alias` mapping `bus` to `sbs bus` prevents an input such as `smrt bus` from being parsed properly
as it would be replaced with `smrt sbs bus` by the parser.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
The biggest factor in choosing `Alternative 1` is to make it easier to prevent possible recusion due to alias chaining,
which would potentially be a fatal bug in the application.
Additionally, while it may be possible to determine which one the user means judging by the context in which it was used.
However, that is far out of the scope of the module and would require much more processing of user input.

Another alternative would have been to have an alias name follow the following convention `'aliasName'` (i.e. some character before and after)
clear what is an `Alias` within an input.

The purpose behind this feature was to make CLI input less troublesome, so users do not need to type in the full input string
to carry out commands they may use frequently. In v2.0 we want to look into using data analysis track users' input habits in
order to make suggestions on possible shortcuts or Aliases they may find convenient to have.


===== Aspect: Data structure to store Aliases.

* ** Alternative 1:** List
** Pros: Less space needed to store same amount of data
** Cons: Takes time to loop through the list to get the right output.

* ** Alternative 2(Chosen):** Map
** Pros: Simple to access
** Cons: More space needed.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
As the user can define multiple aliases, it was important for the internal structure of `AliasMappings`
to allow accessing the aliases by name.

If an ArrayList was used, the numbering each alias would change if new ones were added and old one removed or replaced.
Map was used to prevent this problem as the name is used as the index. This avoids the need to loop through
all the 'Alias' defined.

It also makes it easier to prevent sharing of alias names between aliases and a Map's key
set cannot contain duplicates, and makes it easier to handle overwriting of existing aliases with same name.



// tag::CommandLine[]
=== Easier Command-Line feature
==== Necessity of feature.
Due to the constraints of this project, the application had to be designed such that the main interaction
between the user and the application was the Command Line Interface. However, this required the user to be able to
remember the commands as well as the syntax for these commands, or be forced to heavily refer to the user guide or to
refer to the error messages.

The Easier Command-Line feature was implemented to remove the need to refer to the user guide just to
find out the syntax needed to use a command, as well as to provide some quality-of-life features found in most Command Line
Interfaces not present in the original Address Book 3. This feature consists of several features:

.Command Box class diagram
image::CommandBoxClassDiagram.png[]

. Syntax highlighting
. Input Suggestion and auto complete
. Input History
. Context based Generic Commands

==== Syntax highlighting Implementation
The Syntax highlighting feature was implemented to make it easier to differentiate the different arguments after typing
as well as to implement some basic realtime input validation. This feature utilises RichTextFX's StyleClassTextArea to
apply different styles to different regions of the text, and regular expressions to determine how to to highlight user input.

.Activity diagram of depicting the events triggering text to be highlighted
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram.png[width=70%, align=center]

As it would be quite resource intensive to recalculate the syntax highlighting every time the user types,
the updated highlighting is only computed after a delay of 300 milliseconds after the user stops typing.

When the `MainWindow` is initialized and the inner UI parts are created, the commands which are supported by the `syntax
highlighting` feature are configured. Each `SyntaxHighlightingSupportedInput` object contains a `CommandWord` to highlight
prefixes the command supports. When it is created it creates a regex pattern such as below.
----
(?<command-word>COMMAND)|(?<prefix0>PREFIX0)|(?<prefix1>PREFIX1)|...

(?<command-word>addalias)|(?<prefix0> a/)|(?<prefix1> i/)(?<arg>\S+)
----
This pattern is used to find the command word in the user input, as well as the prefixes.


==== Syntax highlighting Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How long should the delay between updating text and recomputing highlighting?
* ** Alternative 1:**  Text is re-highlighted immediately upon a change to the text
** Pros: Looks much more natural without a delay
** Cons: Much more resource intensive as typing involves multiple changes to the text.

* ** Alternative 2 (Chosen):** Text is re-highlighted after a delay
** Pros: Can reduce the computations needed to highlight the text.
** Cons: Does not look at natural, and is less helpful in validating input.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): **
In the end, despite the fact alternative 1 was more natural looking, alternative 2 was chosen as this option would make
the application less taxing for less powerful systems.

===== Aspect: Extent of input validation
* ** Alternative 1:**  All parts of the input are validated (including the arguments)
** Pros: This would make it more obvious to the user what is valid
** Cons: This is more resource intensive

* ** Alternative 2 (Chosen):** Only the command word and prefixes are validated.
** Pros: Less resource intensive while still being helpful to the user
** Cons: Not as helpful to the user.

* **Solution (Current Implementation): ** +
In the end, despite the fact alternative 1 provides more use to the user, input is already validated when it is parsed,
and the error provides sufficient details on what is wrong with the user input. Validation by constantly parsing the text and then
applying some sort of style to indicate an invalid input does not give as detailed information on why the input is invald.
While it may be a nice feature to have, it may not be worth the resources required to repeatedly calculate the
positions I should move my bones.

In future implementations, MooLah v2.0 should support better real time parsing of input and support validation of input without requiring the user
to enter the command as well as a more functional input field.

==== Suggestion Feature Implementation.
The Suggestion feature is the main part of this feature and provides users with suggestions of valid inputs they may need.
There are three states of the suggestion feature

1. Disabled
2. Suggesting command word
3. Suggesting prefixes

When the user chooses to disable the feature, the suggestion feature does not analyse the user input.

.Activity Diagram depicting what
image::SuggestionActivityDiagram.png[width=60%,align=center]

When the user chooses to enable it, if the user has only entered one or zero tokens (a string of characters without spaces),
the suggestion menu will be populated with command words which begin with the user input.
If the user has entered multiple tokens, and the command word (first token) if a valid command, the suggestion menu
searches for the command's supported prefixes and populates the menu with the prefixes the user has not entered yet.

This feature uses the ``ArgumentTokenizer`` from the ``Logic`` to determine what prefixes are present in the input
and which ones have yet to be provided by the user.

==== Suggestion Feature Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Automatically complete upon typing, or show suggestions and auto complete upon selection

* ** Alternative 1:**  Auto complete upon typing

** Pros: This would make result in the least keystrokes required to enter a command.
** Cons: Requires a lot of logic for behaviour of autocomplete depending what the user is typing or deleting
form the input and a very rigid syntax for commands.

* ** Alternative 2(Chosen):**  Show suggestions and complete upon selection
** Pros: Gives user more information on what commands are available and allows for more options for command syntax.
** Cons: Requires more steps to use suggestion

* **Solution (Current Implementation): ** +
Between the two, Alternative 1 was the first way this feature was implemented. However, as the number of commands increased,
the time taken to generate the suggestions increased to a point where suggestions were not shown immediately. Alternative 2 was
chosen as this method is less prone to bugs, less resource intensive, and allows the menu to display more information
for the user such as what each prefix stands for.

In the future, MooLah v2.0 will support suggestions for arguments on top of prefixes and command words.


==== Input History Feature Implementation.
This feature enables users to re-enter previous input without having to retype the entire input.
It is a relatively simple feature which saves user input into a list and iterates through the list when the user
presses the `up` or `down` arrow keys. When a user enters a new input, the position of the iterator is reset.

==== Generic Command Implementation
This feature allows allows different commands to use the same command word. As MooLah has around 30 commands with only the current
features, it may becomes a problem that command words become very long in order to make it clear what the command
does when there are multiple commands which do similar things in different context. This feature reduces the ambiguity of
a command by enabling certain common command words to behave differently depending on which `panel` of the UI the user is viewing.

// end::CommandLine[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
