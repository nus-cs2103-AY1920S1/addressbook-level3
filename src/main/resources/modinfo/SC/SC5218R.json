    "description": "This module deals with topics in population and aging on a rotational basis. Issues covered include fertility, mortality, migration, and population ageing and health issues, depending on lecturer's expertise and availability during a particular semester. One of the aims of the module will be to provide students with an understanding of population issues relevant to Singapore's changing age structure. These include the impact of low fertility, increasing longevity, immigration, and ageing. Both the theoretical underpinnings and the policy implications of these demographic trends will be examined.",
