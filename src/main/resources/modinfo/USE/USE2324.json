    "description": "Women around the world struggle with the various fallouts from climate crisis. This vulnerable demographic struggles to combat both real and ideological conditions connecting women and Nature. Cognizing this, the field of Ecological feminism [Ecofeminism] has grown rapidly in the past few decades. This introductory module to ecofeminism will combine literary analysis, environmental humanities and feminism. It will extend students\u2019 knowledge of feminism and environmental issues relating to women. Fundamental to the study will be the literary analysis of texts taught in a scaffolded way. The module will examine literary texts by Asian women across South, East and Southeast Asia.",
