== Introduction

*DeliveryMANS* is a delivery management system that allows administrators of delivery centres to manage their deliveries effectively and efficiently. There are 4 management contexts to DeliveryMANS which are order, customer, deliverymen and restaurant where each context will manage their individual parts. I am in charge of the customer side of the system and have implemented an automated tagging system to tag the customer's favourite cuisine automatically.

This document will include a summary of my coding contributions and an excerpt of the user guide and developer guides that I have documented.

== Summary

This section is a summary of the feature implemented, code contributions and documentations made to the project.

=== Feature - Automated tagging system

When the user adds an order, the tags are sent to the customer and the system will display the top two appearing tags on the UI. If there are new orders added, the system will evaluate all the tags of that customer and determine which are the top two tags.

This feature allows the user to spend less time to find the trend and spend more time to put the trend data to use.

=== Code contributed

* Implementation of basic context switching functions - https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-2/main/pull/53[#53]

* Improvement to context switching functions based on feedback from team members - https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-2/main/pull/117[#117]

* Implementation of automated tagging system - https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-2/main/pull/187[#187]

=== Documentation contributed

* Edit Developer Guide to be suitable for the project DeliveryMANS - https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-2/main/pull/84[#84]

== Contributions to the User Guide

This section of the document is an excerpt from our https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/main/UserGuide.html[DeliveryMANS - User Guide] focusing on the customer side of commands that I am tasked to implement.

=== Customer commands

These are commands pertaining to customer context of *DeliveryMANS*. The screenshot below shows how the customer context will look like in *DeliveryMANS*.

image::userguide\CustomerList.png[]

This is a customer and its information. Each card will display the customer's username, favourite cuisine, name, phone number, address and the number of orders the customer has made.

{nbsp} +

==== Adding a customer: `add`

This command allows you to add a new customer to the customer list. `USERNAME`, `NAME`, `PHONE` and `ADDRESS` are necessary to a customer.

[NOTE]
====

The `USERNAME` of customer cannot be changed after adding.
====

Format: `add u/USERNAME n/NAME p/PHONE ad/ADDRESS`

Example: `add u/JohnDoe n/John Doe p/91234567 ad/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`

{nbsp} +

==== Editing a customer: `edit`

This command allows you to edit an existing customer in the customer list. The index of a customer needs to be provided while the information to edit are optional.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS]`

Example: `edit 1 n/John Woe p/97654321`


.Example use case

. You want to change John Doe's phone number but his address stays the same.

. Simply type in `edit 1 p/97654321` into the command line and press enter.

[start=3]
. The result box will display that the edit is successful and John Doe's phone number has changed.

[NOTE]
====

.Requirements
* The index `INDEX` provided must be within the customer list size and be greater than or equals to 1.
====

{nbsp} +

==== Deleting a customer: `delete`

This command allows you to delete an existing customer in the customer list. The index of a customer needs to be provided.

Format: `delete INDEX`

Example: `delete 1`

[NOTE]
====

.Requirements
* The index `INDEX` provided must be within the customer list size and be greater than or equals to 1.
====

{nbsp} +

==== Viewing a customer's order history: `history`

This command allows you to view a customer's order history. The index of a customer needs to be provided.

Format: `history INDEX`

Example: `history 1`

.Example use case

. You want to view John Doe's order history.

. Simply type in `history 1` into the command line and press enter.

image::userguide\CustomerHistory.png[]

[start=3]
. John Doe's order history will be listed on the right panel.

* The index `INDEX` provided must be within the customer list size and be greater than or equals to 1.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

This section is an excerpt from our https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html[DeliveryMANS - Developer Guide] focusing on the implementation I have made on the application.

// tag::auto tagging customer cuisine
=== Automated tagging of customer

Tags determine the customer's favourite cuisine. It is helpful to the user as having this information will enable the user to make better analysis on the current trend of food. Although we can opt for the user to manually add in tags, it might be problematic once the number of customers in the database gets too large for a single user to handle. Thus, this feature aids the user by automatically tagging the customer based on the customer's order history.

==== Implementation

The `Tag` of the `Customer` is related to the `Tag` of the `Restaurant`. If an `Order` has been added to the database, the `Tag` of the `Restaurant` will be added to the `Tag` of the `Customer`. If the `Customer` has multiple ``Order``s, the `Tag` that will be shown on the `CustomerCard` will be the highest two ``Tag``s. This is the main process on how the application automatically tags the customers.

An activity diagram below shows the automated tagging process when adding an order:

Another function called `changeMainTag()` is used to change the main ``Tag``s of the `Customer` to show on the `CustomerCard`. The activity diagram below shows how the application determines the top two ``Tag``s:

==== Design considerations

*Aspect: Method of editing ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Adding, deleting and editing of `Order` will edit the ``Tag``s in `Customer`.

** Pros: Only the commands that add, delete or edit an `Order` will require editing the ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s.

** Cons: Creates more dependency between `Customer` and `Command` classes.

* *Alterative 2:* `Customer` storing a list of ``Order``s and iterate through that list to get the number of ``Tag``s.

** Pros: Editing ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s only happen in the `Customer` object itself and doesn't need to depend on information from other objects.

** Cons: Every single change to any `Order` has to be reflected on ``Customer``'s `Order` list. Including edits to ``Order``s made in `Deliverymen` and `Restaurant` context. This makes `Customer` have a lot of dependency with other classes.

We chose to go with the first alternative as `Customer` class will have lesser dependency with other classes when editing tags. In addition, displaying the ``Customer``'s order history will only require `Customer` to access the `OrderDatabase` to get the list of orders. Both of these requirements together still makes the `Customer` class have lesser dependency with other classes compared to implementing the second alternative that makes the `Customer` class have dependencies with every `Order` related classes.

*Aspect: Method of storing ``Tag``s*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Using a map to store the ``Customer``'s ``Tag``s where key is the `Tag` and value is the number of tags.

** Pros: Faster access of ``Tag``s in the map and getting the number of a certain ``Tag`` only takes O(1) time.

** Cons: More memory is needed to store the information. A map to store all ``Tag``s and a set to store the main ``Tag``(s) to display on `CustomerCard`.

* *Alternative 2:* Using a list that stores all ``Tag``s that are in `Customer`.

** Pros: The list is capable of storing all of the ``Tag``s that `Customer` has.

** Cons: The list needs to be iterated through to determine the top ``Tag``(s) of `Customer`.

We chose to go with alternative 1 as we believe speed is more important to the user and sacrificing memory space is the better choice.
