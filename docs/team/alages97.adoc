== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing AddressBook3 - a given CLI (Command Line Interface) application into a better product.
Through the ideation phase, we decided to morph the application into the Njoy Teaching Assistant. We realised that many teachers
had issues with managing large groups of students and keeping track of the many physical documents that they require
to perform their daily tasks. Therefore, we came up with a solution for them : nJoyAssistant. In particular, the Njoy Teaching Assistant enables
teachers to maintain student records to manage students better
; set questions and quizzes to enhance students learning; and keep track of
their schedules with an interactive timetable.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write code for the `student`, `group`, `tag` and `mark` features. The rest of the sections will cover the
summary of my contributions to the codebase, the user guide and the developer guide.

The following are icons and symbols that I will be using for the Project Portfolio:

== Summary of contributions

This section entails a summary of my specific enhancements, code contributions and other helpful increments towards the Njoy Teaching Assistant.

I implemented the commands related to `student`, `group`, `mark` and `tag`, which include:

* *Adding a student to the student record*
* *Removing a student from the student record*
* *Editing a student in the student record*
* *Listing all students in the student record*
* *Adding a tag to a student*
* *Adding a mark to a student*
* *Removing a mark from a student*
* *Creating a group of students*
* *Adding a student to a group*
* *Removing a student from a group*
* *Listing all students in a group*
* *Exporting a group of students to a word document*

[[Grouping]]
I'll be sectioning the functionality into the following format (where applicable for the features):

. *Creation*
. *Deletion*
. *Editing*
. *Display*

=== Enhancements

== Student

=== Student Creation and Deletion

* *What it does:* Users can create students that represents the students that they teach. Students are created by
specifying their full names at the point of creation, and students can be tagged with the `tag/` command at the point of
creation, which will be discussed under the `tag` feature. Users can also remove students that they no longer teach
from their list of students.

* *Justification:* Teachers usually have many students under their control, and having a physical copy of the student list
to manage their students can be a hassle. Thus, with nJoyAssistant, teachers can now have a digital copy of the list of
students that they teach, so that they can manage them easily.There is also a possibility that teachers may no longer teach a particular student, and thus nJoyAssistant
provides the functionality for a user to remove students that users are no longer teaching.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The hardest part was to make sure
that no repeated students were added to the student list which involved keeping track of what questions have already been
added.

=== Student Editing

* *What it does:* Users can edit students that are currently in their student list.

* *Justification:* There is a possibility that teachers key in the names of their students wrongly when using nJoyAssistant.
Thus, instead of removing the student and adding a new student into the student list, nJoyAssistant provides the functionality
to edit the name of a student within the student list.

== Tag

=== Tag Creation

* *What it does:* Users can `tag` their students, with the tag keyword specified after `tag/`.

* *Justification:* Different students usually have different subjects that they are weak at, and it is often hard for teachers
to keep track of which students are struggling with which subjects. Thus, nJoyAssistant provides the functionality to tag
students according to the subjects that they are weak in, allowing teachers to quickly and easily identify the weak subjects
of the students that they teach.

== Mark

=== Mark Creation and Deletion

* *What it does:* Users can `mark` their students and remove `mark` from their students.

* *Justification:* Teachers usually have a handful of students that are struggling overall academically, and are in urgent
need of academic help. Thus, nJoyAssistant provides the functionality of marking students, which highlights the students'
name with a red marking on the user interface. This will once again allow teachers to easily identify these students, and
provide academic help accordingly. Also, it is possible for students to improve academically, and thus nJoyAssistant provides users
an option to remove marks from students.

== Group

=== Group Creation

* *What it does:* Users can create groups with students.

* *Justification:* Teachers usually teach more than one class, and thus need a way to group their students according to the
classes that the students are in. nJoyAssistant thus provides users the functionality to group students and name the group.
Groups are also not limited to classes, and users may choose to group students however they like, for example grouping all
students who are weak in Chemistry, and naming the group "Chemistry Supplementary Lessons"

=== Adding a student to a group and removing students from a group

* *What it does:* Users can add students to a group after the group has been created, and remove students from the group as well.

* *Justification:* There is a possibility that users may want to add students to a group after it has been created, and thus
nJoyAssistant provides that functionality to teachers. Example would be if the student newly joined the particular class.
There is also a possibility that users may want to remove students from a group after it has been created, and thus
nJoyAssistant provides that functionality to teachers. Example would be if the student left the particular class.

=== Viewing students from a group

* *What it does:* Users can view all students in a group that they created.

* *Justification:* Users would want to know which students are in which group, and thus nJoyAssistant provides the functionality
to view all the students in a particular group.

=== Exporting students from a group to a word document

* *What it does:* Users can export all the students from a group into a word document.

* *Justification:* Users may not have access to their computers at all times, and thus nJoyAssistant provides users an opportunity
to export students from a group into a word document, which can then be printed and used at the times when users have no access
to their computers.

* *Highlights:* Students retain their tag and mark information when they are exported into the word document, which was hard
to implement.
