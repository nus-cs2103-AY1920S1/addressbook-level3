Adapted from Yale\u2019s iconic Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy, the structure of this summer seminar will introduce students to the theory and practice of grand strategy from different analytic perspectives. With a focus on the environment, public health and the global movement of peoples, we will consider how to frame priorities to address these issues.",
