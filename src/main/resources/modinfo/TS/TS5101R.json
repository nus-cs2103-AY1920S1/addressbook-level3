    "description": "This module provides a broad-based critical and methodological foundation for advanced research in theatre and performance. Taking one example from each of three aspects of performance a script, a live performance, and a media/cultural performance the module trains students to examine and compare the critical positions and questions posed by a range of theoretical texts with different approaches, priorities and methodologies. Core topics are the mutually transformational modalities of textuality and performativity, live and mediated performance, and non-traditional critical and performance practices. Students are guided in formulating a research proposal and project, which forms the main coursework component.",
