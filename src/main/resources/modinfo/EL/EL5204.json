    "description": "Typology and universals are concerned with how the pieces of languages are put together, what they contain, and how and why they interact and function as they do. Students acquire a broad overview of the grammatical make\u2010up of languages and an understanding of an important approach in contemporary linguistics. Typology contributes to and draws on core areas of linguistics that students have studied.",
