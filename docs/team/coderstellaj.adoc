== Introduction

This project portfolio page (PPP) introduces the project, treasurerPro.
Then the PPP outlines my contributions to the project and showcases the key features I implemented.

=== About the project

My team consists of 5 students from Computer Science/Computer Engineering.
And the project is part of the module 'CS2103T Software Engineering Project'
where we were tasked to develop a basic command line interface desktop application by morphing or enhancing an existing AddressBook desktop application.
Our team decided to incorporate and morph the AddressBook application into our application **treasurerPro**.

Our application enables treasurers of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Clubs to manage their club finances,
reimbursements, inventory and member’s contact details easily. This is what treasurerPro looks like when it is first opened:

== Summary of contributions

My role is designing and implementing the features of reimbursement tab as well as testing the functionality of this tab.
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

=== Enhancements

* Extracting reimbursements from transactions grouped by person
** What it does:
The reimbursements are automatically extracted from transaction records if they have not been paid.
The reimbursements are grouped by person.
And any updates to transactions will also be reflected in reimbursements.
** Justification:
This feature helps the user to quickly view how much money the treasurer needs to pay to a member.
The amount and descriptions are aggregated together from transactions for the member.
So it will be very easy to manage reimbursements.
** Highlights:
If there are any changes to transactions, the reimbursement records are also updated in accordance with new transaction information.

* Adding a deadline to a reimbursement
** What it does:
The user can use [blue]`deadline` command to add a deadline to a reimbursement.
** Justification:
The user can add a deadline by using [blue]`deadline` command.
The treasurer can easily remind himself when he should pay back to the members when managing a CCA event.
** Highlights:
In case of any date changes, the treasurer can use [blue]`deadline` command to reassign a new deadline to a reimbursement.
And if the user is reckless and keys in 30-Feb-2019, our app can correct it to 29-Feb-2019 and adds the date.

* Finding and marking a reimbursement
** What it does:
The user can use [blue]`find` command to find a reimbursement for a member.
And the treasurer can mark the reimbursement as done using [blue]`done` command.
** Justification:
If the treasurer wants to check how much he should pay to a member, he can quickly find the details using [blue]`find` command.
After paying back the member, he can use [blue]`done` command to remove the reimbursement from the tab.
** Highlights:
The [blue]`done` command requires interactions with transactions.
Integration is done between transactions and reimbursements to make sure the reimbursed transaction will not be accounted again in reimbursements.

* Sorting reimbursements
** What it does:
Each reimbursement contains the member's name, amount and a deadline.
The reimbursement records can be sorted based on these 3 attributes using [blue]`sort` command.
** Justification:
It is useful for the user to keep track of reimbursements and view the reimbursement records according to different priorities.
** Highlights:
The [blue]`sort` command can be extended easily to allow other types of sorting.

== Contributions to the user guide

This section contains my contributions to the treasurerPro user guide for the reimbursement tab features.
The following is an excerpt from our treasurerPro user guide, showing only part of the additions that I have made.
As for the complete additions, please refer to
https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#reimbursements-tab[reimbursement tab section]
in the user guide.

=== Adding a deadline to a reimbursement

This command allows you to add a deadline to a member's reimbursement record.

[WARNING]
You can set the deadline as any valid day you want.
It is your responsibility to set a reasonable deadline.

* Command: `deadline p/NAME dt/dd-mmm-yyyy`
* Example: [blue]`deadline p/Alex Yeoh dt/19-Dec-2019`

* Steps:

. Type the command with all parameters filled in, as shown in the screenshot below:
+
.Input deadline command in reimbursement tab
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommand.png[width="500"]
+
. Hit `Enter`
+
If the deadline is successfully added, Leo will respond with a success message
and the deadline will now be displayed for the specified person's reimbursement. +
Otherwise, Leo will show an error message indicating that the person is not in the reimbursement list.
+

image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSuccess.png[width="500"]

[NOTE]
You must provide the deadline in the format `dd-mmm-yyyy` e.g. `19-Dec-2019`. +
If an invalid format is inputted, e.g. `01-AAA-2019` or `19-DEC-2019` or `-1-Dec-2019`, Leo will inform you that the input is invalid. +

If an invalid date is entered, e.g. `31-Feb-2019`, the app will round it to `28-Feb-2019`
and adds the rounded date as the deadline.
But our app only checks up to `31` in day.

[NOTE]
To modify the deadline for a reimbursement, you can use [blue]`deadline` command again to reassign a new deadline to a reimbursement.

=== Marking a reimbursement as done

This command helps you to mark a reimbursement as done and remove it from reimbursement list.

[NOTE]
Reimbursements only take transactions that have not been paid. +
The reimbursement status is not shown in the transaction tab.

* Command: `done p/NAME`
* Example: [blue]`done p/Alex Yeoh`

* Steps:
. Type the command, along with the person's name whose reimbursement is to be marked as done, as shown in the screenshot below:
+

.Input done command in reimbursement tab
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDoneCommand.png[width="500"]

+
. Hit `Enter`
+
The reimbursement for that person will be removed from the tab, as shown below:

==  Contributions to the developer guide

This section contains my contributions to the treasurerPro developer guide for the reimbursement tab features.
It only shows part of the additions I have made.

in the developer guide.

This is an overview class diagram for `LogicManager` of reimbursement tab:

.Overview class diagram of reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

And this is a
https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-3/main/blob/master/docs/images/GeneralSequenceDiagram.png[general sequence diagram]
of command execution.
The detailed implementations of command execution in reimbursement tab are in the following section.

=== Deadline command feature

This command is used to add a deadline date to a reimbursement for a person.
Deadline command requires access to the `Model` of the person package.
Deadline field should be provided in a valid date format.
The person's name inputted has to match a person's name already existing in a `Reimbursement`.

The following sequence diagram shows the execution of deadline command:

.Sequence diagram of deadline command in reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementDeadlineCommandSD.png[width="350"]

A user needs to add a deadline to a reimbursement by specifying the person's name and providing a date.
Firstly, the `DeadlineCommandParser` creates a `DeadlineCommand` with person and deadline date information.
This `DeadlineCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager` of reimbursement.
Secondly, as shown in the figure, the command is executed by calling `addDeadline` method in `ModelManager`.
After the operations, `LogicManager` gets updated reimbursement list from `ModelManager` and displays the deadline in reimbursement list.
Lastly, the deadline is saved into a `reimbursementInformation.txt` file.

.Activity diagram of deadline command in reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramDeadlineCommand.png[width="350"]

As shown by the above activity diagram, when a user inputs a person who does not exist in any reimbursement or keys in an invalid data format, our app displays the expected format of the deadline command.
Otherwise, when the execution is successful, a response informs the user that deadline is successfully added to the reimbursement.

=== Find command feature

This command is used to find a reimbursement that contains the person's name.
The find command requires access to `Model` of the person package.
Person field should be provided and the person's name should exist in reimbursement list.

.Sequence diagram of find command execution in reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementFindCommandSD.png[width="350"]

A user needs to find a reimbursement by providing the person's name.
As shown in the above figure, `FindCommand` is executed by calling `findReimbursement` method in
`ModelManager`.
After the operations, that reimbursement is returned and reimbursement tab only shows a `filteredList` which contains this single reimbursement.

[[ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramFindCommand]]
.Activity diagram of find command in reimbursements tab (reimbursement package)
image::Reimbursement/ReimbursementTabActivityDiagramFindCommand.png[width="270"]

The above activity diagram shows the steps needed for find command.
The person's name is checked whether it exists in reimbursement list.
If not, our app informs the user that person is not in the list.
If command is valid, the found reimbursement is displayed in the tab.

== Overall design considerations

This section's table explains the design considerations for some implementations in the reimbursement tab.

.Table of design considerations and comparisons
|===
|Aspect|Alternative 1 |Alternative 2 |Conclusion and Explanation

|How [blue]`done` command in reimbursement tab updates transactions model and storage.
|The `reimbursementLogic` keeps a `transactionModel` and a `transactionStorage` to update transactions.
|`MainWindow` calls methods from `reimbursementLogic` and `transactionLogic` when a command is executed.
|Alternative 2 is chosen.
`transactionLogic` follows Façade pattern to prevent exposing the internal details of the transaction tab.
So, instead of directly manipulating model and storage of transactions from `reimbursementLogic`,
the operations are done through `transactionLogic` as shown in the <<facadeRe, code snippet>> below the table.

|How reimbursement records are saved and read from `.txt` files
|The reimbursement tab saves all the information of transactions that make up a reimbursement into `reimbursementInformation.txt`.
|The reimbursement tab only saves person's name, amount and the deadline information into `reimbursementInformation.txt`.
When launching the application, reimbursement tab reads the transactions information from `transactionHistory.txt`.
|Alternative 2 is chosen.
Alternative 2 does not save duplicate information that has already been saved into `transactionHistory.txt`.
So, alternative 2 is more efficient.
